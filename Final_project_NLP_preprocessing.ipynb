It\\'s comfy and homely yet practical - allowing me to set up my laptop to answer emails, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), etc. The bed is super comfortable, there\\'s a closet, hooks, plenty of draws and a TV hooked up to Apple TV (which I only used once because of the awesome projector in the lounge - see below). The guest bathroom is right next door to the bedroom with an bath/shower, lots of soft towels and even shampoo and conditioner supplied. All the photos in the listing are exactly how the space is. And this is only the beginning. Val\\'s apartment is beautifully decorated and unique - lots of art on the walls, Janet Jackson printed blinds, big kitchen, lovely sunny outdoor deck. My favourite part is her awesome TV projector, big screen and surround sound in the lounge room. I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to go back to watching House of Cards on a regular TV. I\\'m ruined!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Location\\r\\nThe Mission is hands down the coolest area in SF. It\\'s warm, full of colour, music and life. As they say - \"it\\'s always sunny in the Mission\". I never once felt unsafe, even when walking around at night, and I\\'m a 5\\'1 Aussie girl. There is an endless choice of bars and restaurants to try, and taquerias as far as the eye can see. You haven\\'t had a burrito until you try a Mission burrito. When I wasn\\'t eating delicious food, I went to a few yoga classes at Yoga Tree on Valencia or walked up to Bernal Heights Park - both a stones throw from Val\\'s. But most importantly, Val\\'s apartment is a 2 min walk from 24th Mission BART, which gets you into downtown in literally 5 mins flat. I caught the BART from SFO to Val\\'s when I first arrived and during my stay I commuted to and from SOMA on most days. Getting around on public transport from the Mission to anywhere in the city was dead easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nVal and Lou Doggs\\r\\nVal is San Francisco personified. She is vibrant, beautiful, friendly, smart, successful and incredibly funny. She took me out for a drink on my first night and I knew immediately I had chosen the perfect place. Lou is the most gorgeous and affectionate dog you\\'re ever meet. He loves people, cuddles and will melt your heart immediately. Val has written a guide to SF for her guests which gives you advice into what to do and where to go from a local. She had the perfect balance of hanging out while also leaving you to do your own thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn closing, if you want a genuine SF experience in a beautiful home with one of the most unique people you\\'ll ever meet, look no further. You\\'ve just found it.',\n",

You can be downtown in ten minutes. You can also walk to many great places (parks, restaurants, stores, etc). The house was easy to find and had a parking space right in front which was so convenient. The room was clean, comfortable, had natural light,  closet space, drawers, a TV, and a great wall color. Which doesn't surprise me now that I know Val. Val is detailed in everything she does. Her apartment is clean, well decorated, modern yet cozy.  She left us a binder with instructions on how to use the tv, apple tv, projector, etc, places to check out and things to do in SF. She was also available to answer our questions both in person and through text. Val knows when to respect your privacy but remains attentive of your needs. She was helpful, sweet and funny. Really funny. We had the pleasure of going out with her on our last night. Last but not least, Val has the most lovable dog, Lou. He minds his own but won't turn down a cuddle if you ask.

Perfectly situated in the mission, it's close to lots of great food, bars, cool stores, and a strange performance art popup I didn't understand. And it's just 5 minutes from the BART station, which makes going downtown and entry/egress from SFO very easy and fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is bright, modern, colourful and full of interesting art and artifacts. There's a nice backyard, everything was super clean, there are modern appliances including a good washer and dryer, and there is a straight up baller projector in the living room.

He's very friendly, loved to be petted, does not bark at all. I loved spending time with him during my stay.\\r\\nIt is right at the heart of Mission and most of the cool shops and restaurants are within the walking distance. If you like burritos, the best burrito place in town is right on the next street, about 3 minutes walk. The neighborhood is also well connected with public transport, with lots of Muni buses on Mission street and a Bart station right around the corner from Val's place.\\r\\nI can definitely see myself returning to Val's place the next time I'm in SF. \\r\\n\",\n",

It's next to Delfina and Pizza Delfina - very fine restaurants indeed.  It's next to BiRite, a stunning bakery, and less than 2 blocks from all sorts of great eateries.  It's a really spacious place with a huge living room, big sofa, open plan kitchen, etc.  Guests have a dedicated bathroom too.  The bed linen was really nice too, ditto with the towels - things like this add up to a comfortable happy AirBnB experience.  Lenza is a great guy who is good to talk to, and a clear communicator too (another important factor in being a good AirBnB host).  The place is quiet, peaceful, it's easy to get a good night's sleep, and the neighbourhood felt really safe.  Easily one of the best happiest visits I've had to SF.\",\n",

I felt comfortable and welcome when he and his girlfriend were in the apartment, but I also had my privacy and I often had the apartment to myself. The neighborhood is excellent - you are right by Dolores park, and in the thick of the exciting Mission neighborhood one block from lots of great bars and restaurants. The bed is extremely comfortable, and the apartment is modern and clean. \",\n",

There is a very large kitchen/dining room/living room area- which I always felt at home in (even if Lenza and his girlfriend were around). The bedroom is located at the opposite end of the apartment and is spacious and extremely quiet (you'll never hear any street noise at all). The bed was comfortable, the sheets and towels were soft, and there is even a small terrace connected to the bedroom if you want some fresh air.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonuses: Bi-Rite market (small grocery store) is located right downstairs, Tartine Bakery is a half block away, Dolores Park a block away, less than a 5 minute walk to countless restaurants/coffee shops/shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I would jump at the chance to stay here again. \",\n",

Very much appreciated!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe host, Lenza, is awesome. Really funny.

There also happens to be a great market right below the place, which was a nice touch. \\r\\n\\r\\nLenza was super awesome and everything was set up for me once I got there. The room is huge and I had my own bathroom the entire time. He told me anything in the house was fair game (or that's what it seemed like while I was there), so I was able to wash my clothes with his detergent and grab more than one of his beers from the fridge without feeling all guilty about it. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can't tell, I really liked this place and Lenza is a total boss.

       " \"Nicole is a lively and welcoming host. However, the apartment still needs to improve to make it an enjoyable experience for Airbnb guests.  The best thing about the apartment is the that it's only a block away from the muni stop which takes you straight into the heart of downtown SF and transportation via Uberpool, to and from the apartment, is cheap. There is also an ocean view from the bedroom which is visible on very clear days.  Other than the above mentioned there is not much else that I enjoyed about the place.  The bed is very bouncy and not comfortable and the sheets are itchy. Bring your own towels! The towels provided leave pink fuss all over your body and get stuck in your hair. My boyfriend preferred to use t-shirts to dry off after showers.  After two nights of sleeping there and using the towels, both my boyfriend and I woke up with some itchy bumps on our hands and arms. It may have been caused by something unrelated to the bed or towels but the signs point to a strong correlation. Finally, Nicole did not mention a check out time and although Airbnb provides guidelines for check out times, as an Airbnb host myself, I always discuss it ahead of time with my guests. On our last day, she contacted me 45 minutes before she needed us to check out because she had other guests coming in an hour later. Communication is key in Airbnb and it would have been good to know so that we had a little more time to get ready without being rushed. \",\n",
       " 'The rental is in a safe, quiet part of the city and has a nice ocean view. It was fairly clean besides the ants that made their way in on the second day. The parking was fairly easy as well. Nicole is nice, but hard to comunicate with due to her poor english. She called us multiple times and was quite over bearing. We told her when we were arriving multiple times and she asked us to come earlier because she had to get her nails done. She also told us to bring our own towels. There was no soap provided to shower with. These are fundamental things that an Airbnb should provide and a traveller shouldnt have to travel with. Both the bed (advertised as a queen, but actually a double) and pullout sofa are extremely uncomfortable. When we got there she started complaining about the previous guest telling her that her pillow cases smelled bad and told us to smell them. No big deal, but annoying for sure. She obviously got new sheets, but did not wash them prior to our stay because they were pilling and getting fuzz all over us. The kitchen is not very funtional  and we had trouble getting the stove to work properly. Half the lights in the kitchen and a few in the bathroom were burned out. There was no garden to speak of and she practically yelled at my girlfriend \"why do you need to go out there\" when she asked if we could go out back. Overall not a horrible experience, but definitely falsely advertised, and we would not stay here again.',\n",

Bernal heights is just south of the Mission and and a really cool neighborhood on its own. Public transport is nearby and can get you wherever you want in due time. Parking is a bit toughen the neighborhood but not impossible. We got a spot right outside the house and held onto it for the duration of our stay.

He is an out-going, friendly, upbeat, helpful person who obviously cared about our enjoyment, a little like an inn keeper.  He discussed the house, made recommendations about the neighborhood and, once we occupied, remained highly accessible by text, even though it was over Christmas and he was celebrating the holiday with his loved ones too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is actually better than described in the listing.  The pictures show Brian\\'s exquisite taste but not the carrara marble throughout the kitchen, LR, and bathrooms.  The kitchen LR/DR, and master bedroom are larger.  The DR table, custom-made, has a thin bronze antiqued top cover.  The LR TV (60 inches?) is wall mounted with surround-sound.  Also, the house has a SONOS sound system installed throughout, and Brian provides an iphone you can use to manage it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house is in NOPA, a pleasant, safe San Francisco neighborhood.  It is situated on a quiet street opposite a fire station.  It is a short walk from Alamo Square, a lovely park bordering which are the somewhat famous \"Painted Ladies,\" and Divisidero Street, considered \"hip,\" if you are into that.  One of the few drawbacks of the house, if you bring a car, is that there is no garage and you must rely on not-too-plentiful street parking with two-hour limits 8 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday, for those without a municipal daily parking pass.  However, Brian does provide them at cost at $9 each.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe recommend Brian and his lovely home, and give it five stars.',\n",

It was a great intimate setting away from the office equipped with all the tools we needed to have a productive brainstorming session. Staff was there to greet us and familiarize us with the space, the patio was nice during breaks and we were able to cater in lunch because of the mini kitchen (BiRite caters and is right down the street). I highly recommend this space for your next company offsite. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in an up and coming section of the Mission. One attendee felt it was an eyeopening section of town, but he was not familiar with the Mission. All in all the attendees RAVED about the space. The Mission Bowling Club is right next store.

       " \"The space worked out perfectly for our team, was spacious, and had all the tools we needed. Check-in process was fast and we've already booked the space for another offsite meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly complaint is that this space is through a company which requires an additional signed contract and Certificate of Insurance with them added. This isn't a huge deal but it's not mentioned in the listing, requires a lot of additional back and forth with the host, and adds some steps to the process. Although this is normal with larger spaces and I'm very familiar with the process, it means having HR get our COI updated by our insurance company and having our legal team review the contract. Basically, just causes a lot more steps with a lot more people which becomes time-consuming. This also means they do not automatically forward you check-in info through Airbnb. As a result, I was emailing them repeatedly through the weekend trying to find out the check-in info for a Monday morning meeting, since that info then needed to be passed onto those attendees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI book Airbnbs regularly for our company and this additional leg work took up unanticipated extra time on my end and was annoying but the space itself is great and we'll be back.\",\n",

All in all, our team will use this space again for future workshops––it was perfect for just this kind of thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHosts: The ladies next door were so generous and kind, offering us extra fans for a hot day and folding tables as needed.  They offered us the chance to see the space early, and stay late to clean up.   They are truly wonderful hosts in every respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical: The Wifi is fast.  We brought our own projector and sound system, but the provided gear was also fine, albeit not the latest.

The location is easy to get to via public transit and there is a machine pay parking lot just steps away.

A real gem of a place…….We are so glad we found it! \\r\\nWe enjoyed throughly his beautiful 3 bedroom home; it's ascetically decorated, comfortable, clean & tidy and very welcoming. Not to mention his exceptional unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean is only right there….I mean right in-front of you/  The pictures are more than accurate….. the sunsets are amazing!  It was bliss to wake in the mornings to the sun rising, people jogging walking riding to bring a peaceful feel to the mornings to the dream sunsets casing a magnetic ray of light through the whole house- it was magical. \\r\\nOuter Sunset District it a special part of SF- If you haven't ventured this far west of San Fran- You need to! This district moves to a different beat of a drum with a really cool vib of laid-backness- We've really come to love it & enjoy it since our son has resided there. \\r\\nWe were looking for that special something where we could celebrate our son's graduation from SFSU as well as enjoy our time away, as we too run a small operation that keeps us super busy…. we most certainly found it here. The Outer Sunset is the last frontier to a small town feel and yet quick, easy access to downtown SF/ maybe 40 mins straight run on the tram. The Muni/tram/bus is just around the corner that you can jump on which will take you to all the hot spots you want & need to see in SF;  For SF is one of those special cities in the world you need to explore. Everything was within walking distance; ie exceptional organic food & produce store where you can stock up with all your needs , Devils Teeth coffee is a great hang-out in the mornings, unique little small restaurants to the big Beach Chalet  to a variety in-between - you've got it all there within walking or short drive…..And of-course Golden Gate Park, Sutro Baths & the SF Zoo at opposite poles to explore. \\r\\nGeorge is only a call/text away if you need him for anything- He's super responsive, caring & hospitable that will do all he can to make your stay most comfortable. \\r\\nIt was a very special time in our lives for we only have one son and we wanted to go all out with celebrating his graduation and Georges place & location made it that. \\r\\nCome enjoy & you will see too…..Thank you for opening your home to us George we will forever have great memories xxx \",\n",

The view of Ocean Beach was so peaceful and stunning. We all enjoyed having breakfast by the dining table since it had a huge window so we could watch the action taking place outside. The amenities of the home were more than adequate for us and the beds were all great. The weather and the comfy beds provided us with great sleep, which made the vacation truly relaxing. If you travel often you know what I mean when it takes several nights to get comfortable. We had to force ourselves to leave the home since it felt so comfortable there. We spent our mornings just people watching since there were a lot of surfers, joggers and neighbors out and about. Parking was easy since there were plenty of spots available. So in short if you want scenery, comfy home and peace of mind then this is the home to book. George is also extremely easy to deal with and always available to help with anything you need. He truly made us feel like it was our home during the stay there. The kids loved the house and have already asked to come back there again. We loved it so much that on Sunday we actually went to several open houses in the neighborhood to check out the possibility of getting a home for ourselves. \\nThanks George for letting us use your Amazing home and being such a gracious host. \\n\\n',\n",
       " \"This property was excellent value for our stay in San Francisco with well equipped, comfortable accommodation for four adults.  There was plenty of parking outside the property and we found the sights of San Francisco easily accessible for visiting returning to a quiet and peaceful area for the night.  The ocean was right on the doorstep and it was interesting watching the early morning surfers, joggers and walkers from the balcony whilst drinking coffee.  Our only regret was missing seeing any of the sunsets not because of the weather but because we were out every evening we stayed enjoying downtown San Francisco. A bonus was the excellent weather which we weren't expecting having learned of fogs and cold spells during our research.  Once we had found this property through Airbnb the inquiry process and subsequent booking was very easy and straightforward and George kept in contact with us and answered our queries, checking our arrival arrangements during the day of our arrival.  All instructions and house rules were clearly articulated making expectations easy all round.  We would recommend this property for anyone who likes peace and quiet, comfortable surroundings  away from a city centre and hotels.\",\n",

Also,  we would suggest that a few more plates / glasses / cutlery be provided, as the amount there was not quite enough for a 4BR place.

The apartment is within walking distance to almost everything and looks exactly as seen in the pictures. Market st. was a short walk away and folsom st has some amazing restaurants. I would recommend staying away from 6th st at night as many other reviews have stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany thanks to Laura and David for making our stay in SF a great one!\\r\\nWe would love to stay here again!\",\n",

       " \"Laura and David were great hosts! They had plenty of helpful recommendations regarding sightseeing, dining, and public transit. We really felt at home with them and would definitely stay with them again if we were in San Francisco. Their place is in SoMa, and it's pretty central to anything you could need or want. I would highly recommend staying here!\",\n",
       " \"Laura and David's apartment was fantastic.  It's clean, modern, spacious, comfortable (especially the bed) and in a great location.  We were able to walk most places or catch a cab outside their front door if we needed a lift.  Laura and David are very friendly and laid back. I absolutely recommend their apartment to anyone visiting San Fran.  \",\n",

       " \"Laura and David were wonderful hosts: friendly, attentive, and accommodating. Their place was beautiful and well-stocked with earplugs, towels, and tea amongst many other things. It's also in a great location, just a block away from Sightglass coffee and a couple of blocks from the financial district. I really enjoyed my stay with them and I hope I get a chance to do so again.\",\n",

       " \"Laura and David host in a comfortable, well-attired apartment; while they were out of town when I arrived, they left excellent and detailed instructions on what's around the house, how to operate the various appliances and everything else I could possibly want. They made available just about everything an ad-hoc traveller could need (from toothbrushes to a fan in case of unusual California heat) and booth room and apartment were clean and comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoyed my stay thoroughly and would happily do business with them again next time I'm in San Francisco.\",\n",

       " 'Laura and David were excellent and welcoming hosts. They communicated often ahead of the stay and made sure they were home when I arrived to help me with the lay out of the apartment and the facilities. \\r\\nThey have an adorable dog Chelsea and David was kind enough to keep her engaged with treats to make sure she was comfortable with me there. \\r\\nThe room was comfortable and clean and plenty spacious for one person. the bath room was also very clean and comfortable. \\r\\nOverall I had a very comfortable stay and would have no hesitation in recommending KelSoMA.

       " \"Hands down the best Airbnb experience we've had. Our company flies out a handful of our teammates every month so we have had much experience with booking weeklong rentals. Alex was friendly, prompt and communicative; anticipating needs and taking care of every one of them. His personal touches to make sure the stay was nice was very sweet. And his house - absolutely gorgeous. Well appointed and well maintained, beautiful location and view. A lot of love went into this house and it shows. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. \",\n",
       " 'We had a fantastic time in San Francisco!  And our accommodations were terrific.  It was so nice to stay in a place that felt like our \"home\" away from home.  We would come back from a day of sightseeing and relax with a movie or in the hot tub.  Our kids loved the place too.',\n",
       " \"Alex's house is a gem! Wonderfully appointed, great location, gorgeous views; the house is stylishly designed and immaculate, and filled with thoughtful touches. We were there for a family vacation, with three generations under one roof, and all six of us felt at home, from the 5 year old to the 72 year old. This was our first Airbnb experience, and I fear Alex has spoiled us. I only hope we'll be able to come back to SF and stay in his lovely home again very soon!\",\n",
       " 'Already the cordial and easy communication with Alex prior to our arrival was promising and Alex helped us with an early arrival. But our high expectations were even exceeded. Our three kids (6, 13, 16) almost \"freaked out\" when we stepped in the house, not only because of having Internet TV on a widescreen beamer and a hot tub. (Ok, they lived for 3 weeks in a RV and were a little bit weaned from any convenience). But let´s check the facts beyond the first emotions: the house is perfect for up to 6 people with comfortable beds for everyone. It is very well equipped and was super clean and tidy. From the main room and the balcony you have a great view on the hills of Castro, on the Twin Peaks and on downtown SF. In short walking distance there are 2 bus stops (e.g. line 24 taking you north towards Castro), cozy restaurants and small shops. Alex prepared not only a helpful map of the neighborhood on his blackboard, but also a perfect guide to the house and - not to forget - a warm welcome message, a fruit bowl and a welcome drink. All in all we really felt at home in Alex house and for sure we will come back. BTW it was our first booking with airbnb - it couldn´t have been better! ',\n",
       " \"This was the perfect end to an amazing holiday. Alex has the most beautiful home and made us feel so welcome. The beds were incredibly comfy and the view was absolutely stunning. We went to several of Alex's restaurant recommendations nearby and they all blew us away. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!\\r\\n\",\n",
       " \"We had a wonderful stay at Alex's house.  The accomodations are unbeatable and the deck and its view of the Noe Valley are as well.  The neighborhood is very agreeable with its small shops and restaurants within walking distance. Alex's indications prior to our arrival as well as how everything is pointed out within the house made our experience much easier and enjoyable. In summary, we couldn't ask for more.\",\n",
       " 'Alex was the most accommodating host.  Alex was prompt with his responses from the beginning and always used kind words.  The house was so beautiful and the location was ideal.  The house had a very comfortable and home feeling throughout but still felt modern and chic.  There are a lot of details throughout the home that lets you know there was a lot of care and quality put into the home.  Alex left several pamphlets to answer any questions about the home and neighborhood. He answered all of our questions before we knew we had questions.  He was so kind that he even gave us a card and a gift to enjoy the last night.  I highly recommend this stylish Noe Valley home and the neighborhood was just spectacular.  I will be very surprised if any other host could top the kindness and consideration Alex exuded.  Thank you Alex for a perfect vacation!',\n",
       " \"Alex's house is gorgeous and he was incredibly sweet and helpful. My family stayed in his home recently while visiting me in SF and they all loved the place. My dad has back problems and Alex took the time to show me the house before I booked it so I could ensure it's suitability. He also continued to communicate leading up to our rental period to see if there was anything he could do to help prepare. Furthermore, Alex had fruit, champagne, coffee and even a welcome card awaiting my families arrival! His house is clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. The views from the decks are fantastic too. Parking was easy as you can park in front of the driveway. Location is also very convenient to Noe Valley shops, the Mission, the freeway, the Castro, and many other areas. Alex has taken the time to prepare the house for guests, even drawing a large chalk map of the neighborhood, that included business cards at their appropriate locations. We were impressed. I hope my family returns to SF in need of a nice home to stay in again so I get to spend more time in this beautiful house! \",\n",
       " \"This house is amazing.  You always worry a place won't be as great as the pictures but all 5 of us loved this house.  It is set up perfect for families and for relaxing and enjoying the city.  Every little touch is there for your enjoyment.  The hot tub was great and they had towels set right at the door for your use.  We will look forward to staying here the next time we visit our son who lives in Palo Alto.  This is perfect if traveling with large group.  So much better to have a house then multiple hotel rooms.  Also nice to get away from the crowds after touring the city.  Stay here you will be very happy you did.  \",\n",
       " 'The home was a great place to spend the holidays with my two daughters in San Francisco. The views were beautiful, the street was quiet, the home has all the latest technology--we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. And Alex is a most gracious host. Thanks so much.',\n",
       " \"We had a fantastic stay at Alex's house in Noe Valley over New Year.  The house is great and very well situated, within easy striking distance of some fantastic restaurants and cafes as well as public transport links and supermarkets etc. And whilst being pretty central it's a quiet neighborhood and street parking is really easy.  Alex was also very easy to deal with.  All our queries were answered promptly and efficiently and we were made to feel very welcome.  We would definitely recommend both him and the house to others.     \",\n",
       " \"We recently stayed at Alex's house for a friends' reunion weekend and loved our experience.  The house is in impeccable condition and both the architecture and interior design were beautiful!  The view from the upstairs deck is unbelievable and the downstairs hot tub was a very nice touch.  As a host, Alex was extremely responsive, always polite, and always willing to help wherever needed.  We had a few questions along the way and despite the fact that Alex was out of the country, he still managed to respond promptly.  That said, the documents that were left in the house pretty much answered everything and included some really great recommendations for the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would definitely come back to stay at Alex's house anytime I'm back in San Francisco.  Thanks again, Alex!\",\n",
       " 'Our family stayed at Alex\\'s wonderful home in Noe Valley for 5 nights.  The home is even better than it looks in the photos.  The space is so well designed. Alex (and presumably his wife whom we did not have the occasion to meet) have a meticulous design aesthetic.  Their style is modern, streamlined, creative, and  most of all functional.  Alex was very responsive when a fuse blew out.   I insisted he did not need to come to the home to fix it as it was just in one area of the kitchen and we were only there one more night, but he insisted that he drive in from the east bay to address the issue immediately.  He was pleasant and helpful and also very conscious about giving us \"our\" space.  He was also very nice about a misplaced key (which it turns out he found).  We were very happy about our choice and our stay. ',\n",
       " 'This home was amazing!  Great location with beautiful views, spacious and comfortable!  Alex was a great host and met us on arrival to show us around the property.  I would recommend his home to anyone interested in staying in San Francisco!',\n",
       " 'Really excellent accommodation. I could/did spend hours on the terrace just watching the views of Noe Valley below. Very complete kitchen so ideal if you feel like rustling up a meal. We found our rented car very useful for going down into the Noe Valley for food shopping etc.',\n",
       " 'What a wonderful place to stay!  The views are incredible, the home is beautiful and the neighborhood is nice and quiet with lots of public transport options and restaurants near by.  It was the perfect place for our 10 day SF stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",
       " \"This is a 6 star place! It's stylish, very comfortable and a jacuzzi on the terrace with views over SF makes it really stand apart. We loved the espresso machine and complimentary beans, made us really feel at home :) \\r\\nThe kitchen has a lot of gear and was stocked with spices and oils.  \\r\\nBeds are comfy and the street is very quite at night, so well suited for a good night's rest. \\r\\nAlex is a superb host, early arrival was no problem at all, we received a warm welcome and he gave thoughtful tips prior to our stay as well as superfast answers on the questions we had. \",\n",
       " \"We stayed in the house during our family trip to California. After staying in several hotels prior to arriving in San Francisco, it was a nice to be able to relax in a cozy home, with great views and a well-equipped kitchen. The basket of fruit and bottle of wine provided by Alex on arrival were a thoughtful gesture. We loved the neighbourhood - quiet, yet close to restaurants and other amenities, and a short drive from many of the areas we wanted to visit in the city.  The house manual provided comprehensive and clear instructions about the house and the neighbourhood. We tried out a few of Alex's restaurant recommendations, and they were excellent. Throughout the booking process and the time leading up to our stay, Alex was always very responsive. We had a great time - thanks Alex!\",\n",
       " 'Alex was an incredibly thoughtful host, and his house was everything we wanted and more! My family and I stayed there for a 4-day trip to the city, and after a harrowing travel experience, coming home to the Noe Valley made us forget all of the craziness. We were thrilled with the all the arrangements - especially with the lovely hot tub and the beautiful balcony view of the city. The house had so much character and made us feel like we were really experiencing the eclectic charm of SF. Alex really made our stay feel extra special. It was super easy getting in, and he was very responsive to any questions we had. No complaints whatsoever - highly, highly recommended!',\n",
       " \"Alex was very communicative and clear from the moment we booked this home for a summer family trip. The directions to his home, parking, etc., were all easy to follow. At the home there was a very well organized house instructions binder, and a thoughtful chalkboard diagram of the neighborhood, highlighting favorite places to eat, shop, etc. I don't think the experience could have been easier, or more helpful. \\r\\nThe home, as is depicted in the photos, was beautiful, neat, welcoming and practical. It was even better than we could have hoped. The neighborhood is extremely cute. Busy enough to satisfy anyone wanting to have fun, and be in 'the mix', but the house was removed enough to be very peaceful. Parking 2 cars was a little tight. I was concerned about the directions to pull my car up to the garage, blocking a portion of the sidewalk. Living in LA, there would be a ticket on my windshield for that in 2 minutes (literally), but obviously there's an understanding in SF in place, as my car was there for 4 days straight, and no tickets. \\r\\nIn summation, fantastic. Full confidence in this rental, and Alex. \",\n",

       " 'Alex, our stay in San Francisco was great and the comfort we found each morning taking our breakfast with the view from your appartment, tea time on your terrace and diner and chat in the open living room really made this a great experience.  \\r\\nAlex was on leave when we arrived but he had prepared everything for us to feel welcome: basket of fruits, milk, Orange juice...\\r\\nAmex place is in a great location as besides from the view and cosiness of the apartment, the neighborhood is great with what really felt like a small town \"ambiance\" : great shops, café and restaurant.\\r\\nThanks again and we will definetely recommend or come back!',\n",
       " \"We absolutely loved this house and the neighborhood. As a party of 3 colleagues we all had our own room, a good size diner table to do some work and 2 outdoor spaces to enjoy the great view on the San Francisco hills and the city center. It's a unique 2 story house with lots of interesting design features in a quiet street.\\r\\nOur conference was in the city, which was an easy 20 to 25 minute taxi ride into the city (depending on the time of day). In the evenings we enjoyed the restaurants and shops in the neighborhood, which appears very safe. The kitchen is well equipped and one wall is used to tell visitors what is where in the neighborhood. The house manual includes recommendations for restaurants in the area. All very helpful.\\r\\nA special treat is the hot tub with a view of the city. Just what we needed after a long conference day.\\r\\nCan definitely recommend this place if you want to explore San Francisco from a local perspective. Hardly any tourists in the neighborhood.\",\n",
       " \"We loved staying here. Just to add to what others have said about Alex's wonderful apartment, despite being elegant enough to send you home with a bunch of interior design ideas we also found it a great place to stay with our kids. It's very spacious and well equipped, with breakables well out of reach of little hands and feet. There's a lovely park two minutes walk up the hill where our youngest enjoyed the swings, slides and climbing frame while the older ones played tennis on the court right next door. There's a handy corner shop a minute away where you can get milk or cereal or pizza or whatever it is you suddenly realise you need last thing at night or first thing in the morning. And last but not least the J metro stops just a few blocks away so it's easy to get downtown if you don't want to drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course if you don't have kids then you can spend more time checking out the many nearby restaurants or gazing at the stars from the hot tub, so that's good too ;)\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Alex!\",\n",

Knowing Alex is alumni of Stanford they were extremely excited. Alex was truly helpful. Below is my friend's daughter's comments for Alex: \\n\\nThe house is awesome! The decoration and furniture in the house is really attractive.If you get up early, the view of the neighborhood during sunrise transforming from the darkness to brightness and light is as fabulous as Shanghai at night. FYI, you can find basically everything you need for cooking in the kitchen. Safeway is close so you can buy the ingredients you need there. DIY our lunch and dinner is an interesting experience. Alex, so warmhearted and helpful. The stay is such an enjoyment.\\n\\n Thank you Alex. Hope I will have opportunity to stay at yours myself when I visit SFO. \\n\",\n",

       " \"My girlfriend and I stayed at Alex's home for one week. The home was very clean and tidy and Alex's attention to all details of our stay contributed to an excellent experience. The neighborhood is also very well located - very close to the the Mission and Castro which are within walking distance (if you are not in a rush) and also a quick ride to anywhere in the city by cab or public transport. Noe Valley itself is quiet and almost has a small town feel, so you can appreciate very different aspects of the city by staying here. There are many shops and restaurants nearby worth exploring and my girlfriend spent a couple of days contently exploring the area without having to venture into the city center every day, although that was an easy option as well. The home is perched up on a hill with a great view. The pictures in the posting are an accurate depiction of the home although the photos don't capture the true greatness of the view. Becuase of the length of our stay, we were looking for a place where we could feel like we were enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the city as much as possible even when we were relaxing at the house. The layout of Alex's home certainly creates this environment, whether preparing dinner in the kitchen overlooking the valley through the wide sliding glass doors or soaking in the hot tub downstairs. Alex was very friendly and considerate and very tentative to any need. Although we did not have a chance to meet in person we felt that he would have showed up on short notice if any help was requested. I we would highly recommend this location and would not hesitate to stay again ourselves if we need a place in the city for a few days.\",\n",

It is also highly appreciated the map with pinned name cards in the kitchen to show nearby recommended restaurants. Alex also prepared us a little card on the fresh fruit to welcome us. We all enjoyed to gather in this lovely house. ',\n",
       " 'Lovely home within walking distance to 24th St. restaurants, shopping, etc. in the Noe Valley and convenient to so much in San Francisco.

The location is great with lots of nice cafes and restaurants. The house is also close to public transport and to the Castro and Mission. Alex's house would be perfect for families, friends and colleagues alike and could very easily fit 6 people.

Additionally, the espresso machine with fresh coffee was great fuel for each of our days which were packed to the max. Guys forget soap. We do. Alex had soap and shampoo in the showers ready to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could go on but I will just say that you will experience the conveniences of a hotel plus the conveniences of a home.

Our room was upstairs- it was really modern and well decorated, and we had our own roof top balcony, where you were able to see the city again. The bathroom was extremely cosy with a rooftop window and showering was made nice with fluffy nice towels. Fran´s apartment has really a glamourous decorations, you feel like you almost live there in the city of San Francisco in a luxurious apartment!

Very comfortable bed.  Good ventilation in bedroom.  Nice touch to have computer speakers on the desk so I could listen to music. Nice quiet neighborhood.  Very convenient to have a keypad entry. The house isn't very convenient to BART if that is how you are planning on getting around town.  Bus service is closer, but I didn't use it. 16th St Station is about a 20 minute walk.  If you have any mobility issues, be forewarned, walking is a challenge because of the hills.  You need to be in good shape.  I can't comment on ease of parking as I was walking the entire time.\",\n",

I also recommend the Deli nearby (Chiotras Grocery), with its wine and chesse selection, great sandwiches and its private deck, another little hidden gems of the City. With Fran's house, that makes two gems in the same location !\",\n",

The whole house was clean and tidy with little details which made the experience even better.  The bathroom and shower were both spacious and would rival a five-star hotel! Access to wash laundry or make a cup of tea was perfect for unwinding from a busy day of exploring the city. Climbed a few hills to get to the tasty local eateries but it was worth it.

I had never stayed in this part of SF and while you\\'re a little removed from the action zones of the city the view is better than what you would have on top of Hill St or Sanchez.  I got to jump in the hot tub one day prior to a gig and it was quite nice!\\r\\n\\r\\nI would stay here again, but with that said I think the listing should remove the \"1 bathroom\" as it is a shared bathroom w/ the guests across the hall and the \"1 bathroom\" would indicate private.

Ideal if you're road tripping and need to leave your car somewhere. The bus to the the centre stops only 3 minutes away, and will take you to down town San Fransisco within 15 minutes. The shared bathroom got us a bit worried at fist, but that was totally not necessary (and pretty well indicated up front).

Very spacious with a great shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only the room, but the host is pretty awesome as well. We arrived pretty late in the evening, but Fran stayed up to welcome us.

If you are not social and want privacy, it's OK and this is still a great place, but if you also want an experience feeling welcome like you're visiting a friend, you will love staying with Fran.  Thanks Fran for making my trip to San Francisco so enjoyable.  All of my friends are so excited about this experience as a glimpse into what my move there will be like!  I appreciate you and your hospitality! And it doesn't hurt that Lisa, your other guest, is a retired chef!  :-)\",\n",

       " 'Certainly the accommodations were tastefully decorated and comfortable.  In all fairness this was a very last minute booking and everything went fairly smoothly except that it was not communicated to us that the hot tub was not working, one of the main reasons we booked this particular Airbnb.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we asked about a possible slight discount because of the hot tub not working, Fran responded in a very negative way, saying \"if you don\\'t like it why don\\'t you just go ahead and leave\". Which we obviously couldn\\'t do since there would have been no where else to go and we would not have received our money back.  Sadly that really clouded our stay, and we never felt quite welcome and at ease after that.  As beautiful as the home was and with a lovely location I would not choose to stay there again.  ',\n",

She was also thoughtful enough to make room for us to park our rented SUV outside her garage when I told her that we'd gotten a $100 ticket for parking in the neighbour's way (we were unfamiliar with the street rules...).

We often hear people talking or making noises. On a Friday night, around 1am, someone came home to the unit above us and made a lot of noises. High heels walking on the floor and doors slamming. That woke everyone up.\\n\\nAlso, the furniture, especially the beds and mattresses were cheap.

Joanne\\'s kitchen had plenty room for us to store food and groceries, as opposed to eating out every single time.  Although, there are plenty of great restaurants, bakeries and the delicious Bi-Rite ice cream all within walking distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nParking around the area was also not bad (at least on the weekends).  We were able to find street parking just a few blocks from the house and left our car there all weekend. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoanne was also very accommodating for our check-in and check-out times.

The highlight is the top floor living room area, which has views that are even better than in the pics!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property is very well located in one of my favorite areas in SF - Noe Valley, 1 block for Dolores Park.  It is within easy driving distance to all parts of the city and enjoys slightly better weather than some of the other areas of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a couple of things that one should plan for when using this property:  The gorgeous views comes at the cost of having to climb up 2 floors.  This is not a problem in general but if you have heavy bags or have health issues, it could be a problem.  The other thing to keep in mind is that the garage is typical SF style.  You can park a small car or SUV there, but it will be difficult to park a larger vehicle in the garage.  (This is not a problem specific to this home and is common in homes in SF in general, but it is something to be aware of.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, this house is in a great location with fantastic views and Randy is the type of host who makes the experience hassle-free.

The neighborhood is very charming and cool with great restaurants, shops nearby -and we even played tennis in Delores Park.  Our only, \"heads up\" is this is located on quite a steep hill in addition to the steps to the condo...great exercise and absolutely worth it to have those views!

The home is multi-level (5 fights of stairs throughout house, 1 additional in backyard if you've brought a furry-friend with you), so may not be best for those with knee or hip issues, but is definitely okay for families as each level is fully-secured with baby gates.  The kitchen is a cook/chef's dream with all things you could possibly want/need (french press, vita mix, range of cooking oils and seasonings…) and makes for a great entertaining space.  Music hookups so you can listen to your jams while perusing through their WALL of books - organized by color, no less!  3 bedrooms with beds that feel like clouds to sleep on and bathrooms so everyone can get ready or have their private time, if needed.  Garage space was a real treat to have in the city (may be challenging for those not familiar with SF inclines or snug garages) and easily fit our Ford Explorer.  We did bring our dog and were delighted by all there was to do with him.  Bernal Heights Tower and open space gave him room to run and play with other dogs; Iron + Gold bar down the street welcomed him with a fresh bowl of water and treats while we sipped on their tasty cocktails (a bit loud in front, the back was more conducive to conversation).  Overall, what a FANTASTIC place to stay.  We will definitely be back.  Thank you for your hospitality, Ben!  \",\n",

So much to love about the place: modern design/build, beautiful views of the city, fully stocked kitchen, good size bedrooms that offer nice privacy, everything you need for a young child, garage parking, and more. And Ben was an incredibly helpful and accessible host. The only things that other renters should consider is that there are a lot of stairs (the home is spread over 5 floors) and that the neighborhood itself is very hilly, making it a little difficult to walk places with a stroller.

The lemon trees were producing while we were there and we really enjoyed them. \\r\\nWe had two cars and even though the home only comes with one space (in the garage), street parking was not hard to come by. \\r\\nThe home is spread out over many levels, and there are lots of stairs, so do keep that in mind when booking this bnb. Ben provides toiletries and plenty of towels for those who need them. We did expect however, based on Ben's description of the kitchen, that there would be plenty of spices in the pantry for us to use, but there was only salt, pepper, and oil. It made it difficult to cook meals without having to go out and buy extra spices. Not a big deal for those who plan to eat out, but something to keep in mind. \\r\\nOverall the house and location were perfect for our needs (we were a large party), with plenty to do in the area and lots of delivery places.

Her home is in an awesome and safe neighborhood with free parking and only one bus ride to downtown. Walking distance to many restaurants, markets, cafes, the beach and also the Golden Gate Park. Public transportation was great and giving us easy access to explore any part of the city. We loved our stay at Katie’s. She has a beautiful, well-appointed home with stunning views of the ocean from her large deck off the living room.  We greatly appreciated the breakfast snacks in the morning and yummy chocolates in the afternoon. Her house is spacious, exquisitely clean and fabulous! We loved our room, the bed was so comfortable, and it was nicely furnished and organized. The room and descriptions matched the profile perfectly, and everything went extremely well. The bedroom was quiet at night and all the amenities were just what we needed.\\xa0I really appreciated the fact that it had off-street parking available all day right outside the home. I would definitely stay again at Katie’s house the next time we are in SF!',\n",
       " \"Katie was a very warm and welcoming host. She communicated with us prior to our arrival, and provided information on transportation to her home from the SFO airport. Katie was also flexible about our arrival time and easily accessible, a very accommodating hostess. She was hospitable and went out of her way to ensure that we were comfortable during our stay. She offered fruit, muffins, coffee and tea each morning. We enjoyed coffee on her deck while taking in the breathtaking ocean views. She gave us plenty of space while at the same time being excellent company with loads of great advice about the neighborhood, local bars, eateries, and the city. Her place looks exactly as it does in the photos, very clean and welcoming environment. It had everything we needed. I loved that we had free unlimited parking for our rental car. Amenities were good, wi-fi signal excellent, and the beddings nice and warm. I loved the neighborhood, many restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. Sunset Reservoir Brewing Company and Henry’s House of Coffee both on Noriega Street were great and only a few blocks from Katie’s house. It's also a perfect location to get to SFO Airport; a straight shot to downtown on the #71 bus to BART's Powell Station to get to SFO. Her place was excellent value for the money. She made sure that my friend and I had a relaxing and enjoyable stay in San Francisco. I can’t recommend Katie and her clean, beautiful home highly enough. San Francisco was an amazing experience. Thank you Katie!\",\n",

Katie was very welcoming, sweet, and easy to talk to. Before we even arrived she took the time to ask about our interest and places we were thinking about seeing while in San Francisco.

Not to mention that it was located in the Sunset District, just 10 minutes from Ocean Beach, located on the west side of the San Francisco peninsula and about 15 minutes from Lands End and Golden Gate Park, both of which are scenic national parks. For those who have have never been to San Francisco before, Katie's place provides a personal, homey ambiance with close access to the inner city.\",\n",

       " \"Kevin's place is exactly as pictured but even (URL HIDDEN) was very clean and comfortable.The place was really well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. I will definitely stay here again.\",\n",
       " \"Kevin was very attentive, gave me very prompt answers and negotiations were really easy and reasonable. I had to arrive earlier (only me without my other 3 friends) and he was really quick in adjusting the dates and giving a very good discount on the first night, as expected of a very well intentioned host.\\r\\nApartment is spacious, clean, comfortable. I was sorry I did not see curtains on windows, but that did not become a problem during stay. Although the host does not live in the apartment (I like staying in places where people actually live but it is just my taste), it is well equipped (except lack of washing machine). Wifi was not working very well in all rooms but Kevin quickly helped me with buying a wifi extender, so we had no issues after that. All 4 rooms are similar in size and decoration, good for groups. Bed is great, the linens and blankets are really warm/cozy and new, we can see the host is worried about guest's stay. Towels, shampoos, toothpaste and even make up removals! 5 stars!\\r\\nThe neighborhood is fine, close to parks and golden gate, really beautiful and convenient, there are some restaurants and bars at walking distance. 25-30 minutes in a car to downtown though, but it was ok for us. Apartment has privacy. I felt it was a little bit impersonal, there is no TV set, some furniture is missing (a table in living room or more chairs/couches for people to sit and hang out). Closets did not have drawers or shelves but I assume most airbnbs have restrictions on that, some don't even offer a closet at all, due to logistics, so I guess it's fine too.\\r\\nIn short, I am definitely approving the place and the host and I think you would be very fine renting it.\",\n",
       " \"I am really very happy that we chose this location for our first Air BNB.  Kevin was a wonderful host the minute we made contact.  He kindly met me at the apartment for a requested early check in and was available for any questions for the entire weekend we were there.  This was perfect to host a get together for our family and close friends who are attending our daughter's wedding on Maui.  The house was clean and ready for us to start our weekend when we checked in.  Beds were comfortable.  Space was wonderful.  Just loved it.  Very close in walking distance our excellent restaurants of all cultures.  I would stay here again.  Thank you Kevin.\",\n",
       " 'Awesome stay exactly as advertised great location very quiet!',\n",
       " 'Great location and a very clean place.  We had a hiccup in the checking in process as Kevin and I had originally agreed for my family and myself to check in at 12PM and he texts me at 10:20AM on the day of check in to say that we cannot check in now until about 3pm.  My family and I were already on our way to SF.  He stated that there was a last minute booking, which is fine-it happens, I totally understand but he could not have told us the night before? Or as soon as that person booked and he accepted their request? This was highly inconvenient as I was coordinating and planning with 10 people that were to stay at the AirBnb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, the apt itself is very well maintained.  Be aware though that this is BARE ESSENTIALS. There are no drapes on any of the windows, no microwave, and very few pots and pans if you plan to cook.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOther than that, check in was easy of getting in to the apt and obtaining keys and check out was just leaving the keys on the table and locking the doors behind us. \\r\\n\\r\\nOh, also- my family and I did not mind because we were also up late but the downstairs neighbors were having a party and playing music pretty loudly.  So if you are sensitive to noise, you should probably take note. \\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

There were inviting patios all over this house to enjoy the amazing views of the city. This was way better than a hotel (and it ended up saving us money too). The cab ride to the Moscone Center was about $10 - we probably could have walked but the area between the house and the center seemed a little sketchy. The neighborhood the house was in seemed nice though and I walked down to the nearby Whole Foods and the little neighborhood grocery during our stay - no problem!

I was truly in a clean, tidy, and relaxed environment.  My room had was clean, bed was nice and comfortable.  I had a TV in mine but I never got to use it as I enjoyed the HUGE flat panel in the living room.  Ladies, the bathroom? Details were dialed in.  Qtips, blowdryer, shampoo and conditioner if you use it.  I am a bathroom freak, so the bathroom was clean, as in white bleach clean- no complaints.  I am also a light sleeper and had the room that was in the front of the house.  I was generously offered earplugs in case I needed them, but I travel with them (which I used) and I slept like a baby.  Overall, I have zero complaints about this unit and hosts.  Transportation is right outside, and you really can't beat the price.  I want cleanliness, no fear of walking around barefoot, and great hosts.  I got it all and I wish I would've stayed for more than 1 night.  THANK YOU BOTH!  I wish you the best in your endeavors :)\",\n",
       " \"Good location. It's convenient to go to downtown by bus. Nice host. They introduced a lot of interesting places to visit in SF. His wife even helped us to wash our dirty plates. Happy experience.\",\n",
       " \"Our staying at PK and Kiki's home was very homey, it felt as if we had already met somewhere! Right from the start both were very helpful and always available in providing us with any information - from sightseeing spots to laundry services! Sharing breakfast in the morning was a pleasant experience during which we could share each other's tales and funny stories. The room was very comfortable, noiseless and  immaculate clean...and we slept like bears! The house was also conveniently located close to public transportation. All in all we highly recommend it to anybody visiting San Francisco and wishing to meet a delightful couple!\",\n",
       " 'PK and his wife are very gracious hosts. They made sure I was  as comfortable as possible during my stay. The bedroom was nicely decorated, clean, with a very comfortable bed. I felt at home in their Nice flat. They took the time to get to know me and I enjoyed hanging out with them. OK gave me the inside scoop on public transportation and things to do and see in the city. I would recommend these hosts to all travelers.',\n",
       " 'Pk and Piki were awesome hosts, the room and the bathroom is very nice and very clean. Pk and Piki offered coffee/tea and pastries in the mornings and even let me enjoy their dinner with them. Excellent thai cuisine. The apartment is right in front of a bus station that brings you right into Mission district and city center (e.g. 4th & Mission), BART is maybe 5-10 min walk away. Really convenient. Next door also some places you can grab dinner and a late night store you can grab water or wine etc. ',\n",
       " 'Pk was a great host. Very helpful with travel suggestions. Clean apartment and a very nice host.',\n",
       " \"Pk and Kiki were very hospitable hosts. Pk was very prompt in responding  to and disputing any of my questions and concerns. He was even able to accommodate an earlier check-in time. \\r\\nTheir apartment is very nice, clean, and spacious. The bedroom is of adequate size and has a comfortable bed. The only thing that may be of concern is that the room is located on the side that the street lies, and therefore can be a little noisy when cars and buses drive by. I did not have too much of a problem with this but it could be a problem to some. The bathroom is super clean, equipped with all your needs, and a shower I wish I had in my own home. \\r\\nDon't be fooled by the neighborhood, it may seem a little run down but Pk's apartment is the nicest and newest on the block. I felt safe while staying in his home. Parking was not too bad, but can be a little troublesome, especially if you are coming home late. You have to pay close attention to the street and parking signs. The apartment is located no farther than 25 minutes from anywhere in San Francisco, with easy access to freeways and public transit. \\r\\nOverall, Pk and Kiki were very friendly and helpful. They were respectful of our privacy and made us feel welcome in their home. I recommend Pk as a host to anyone staying in San Francisco.\\r\\n\",\n",
       " 'The apartment is very big and new, with great location. Everything is good. PK is very hospitable. He patiently introduced about the city. I would definitely stay there again when I visit San Francisco next time.',\n",
       " 'The apartment was very nice and clean.  My friend and I had never been to San Francisco before so we had heard negative things about the Mission district in regards to safety, but the building is very safe and we never once felt uncomfortable as two young college girls.  Additionally, Pk was extremely nice and helpful.  He told us how to use the public transportation and was eager to answer all our questions.  We really enjoyed sitting and getting to know him after our long days.  I would definitely stay here again and our experience was very positive.  ',\n",
       " 'Pk and his wife are very nice people and great hosts. We have enjoyed our staying with them in their cute apartment. They are very helpful, they gave us many information and tips and were still available for us. The room is very clean, comfortable bed with wardrobe and TV. The share living room is spacious, very comfortable, modern with huge home cinema. The location is good, safe and close to the city Center by Bart. Thanks Pk and hope to see with your wife in Paris.',\n",
       " 'Pk was very nice and friendly about our stay. He was a little nosey about what we were planning on doing in San Francisco and sometimes would not give us the space we wanted, however our overall experience still ended up good. ',\n",
       " 'Pk made me feel very welcome. He helped me with  the logistics of my stay in SF. I had some scheduling issues come up, and he was very flexible and accommodating. The apartment looks just like you see it in the photos. I found it to very clean and very comfortable. I would definitely stay with Pk again.',\n",
       " 'My first experience was so good I came back for a second one - which was also superb!',\n",
       " 'PK and his wife were very kind and helpful. It was very safe neighborhood close to public transit. I wish I would have asked his advice earlier because he was so helpful finding not just his home but other places around town. His suggestion to go the Golden Gate park and how to get to Chinatown was a great help. We had very limited time in the city and this is a great location if you are driving or flying in from SFO airport. The place was very clean and well kept. The only minor drawback is if you are a light sleeper please take his suggestion and use the provided ear plugs if you are in the bedroom close to the street. Everything is exactly as described in the listing. No surprises. =) The provided little extras like Q-tips and brochures for the city were very nice. Thank you for your hospitality. ',\n",
       " 'To be honest, not a great experience. Our room was very noisy (from street traffic and living room TV) with very little privacy (it opens into the middle of the cooking/living space of the host family). We ate out, because use of the kitchen was frowned upon. There was a huge TV in the room, but no TV signal. Host has lots of rules and regulations, but his directions were wrong (now corrected).',\n",
       " 'PK and Kiki are great hosts! Even if we unfortunately did not have enough time to spend together - as my stay in SF was very short, it was very pleasant to stay in their super clean appartment. PK gave me recommendations on what to do in SF, which I really appreciated. Thank U guys! Both of you were very nice with me!  ',\n",
       " \"Everything was great and as described in Pk's ad. He was very accommodating to an early check in, offered us coffee in the morning and everything was very clean. I would stay here again. \",\n",
       " \"Pk and his wife were great host. I had no problems maintaining contact with them and he provided me with detailed directions getting to the apartment. We chatted about the area and he gave me some suggestions regarding restaurants and options to get around. Room was clean and did have some noise since it's right on Mission Street but that didn't bother me. There are some earplugs and headphones for those that are sensitive sleepers.  I only stayed one night but overall, it was a great experience.\",\n",
       " \"I would wish to say that PK's innate understand of what people needs are is uncanny.  Any information I needed about how to get around San Francisco was duly answered. There were subtle things that PK had in place for safety such as motion sensor lights between the space in the kitchen and the bathroom so that at night I could easily see my way into the apartment or go between the bedroom and the bathroom.  There are fire alarms/smoke detectors,too.  Along with this the apartment was kept very clean.  PK likes the interchange  between people, and asks questions to get to know you.  In addition, he has a very nice sense of humor, and we laughed about some of life's absurdities.  I didn't feel that I was ever interfering in their lives and felt at home in their space.  It was a very good experience and one that I can easily recommend to anyone staying in San Francisco.\",\n",
       " 'I booked this room late Friday afternoon and had to cancel it later that same evening as my dog was bitten and I felt it important to stay with him over the weekend.',\n",
       " \"I booked this room for my friend, he was enjoy the time in PK's house, very convient and comfortable, there a lot of restaurants around, bus is just in front of the door, PK was a great host, friendly and helpful.\\r\\nThanks PK!\",\n",
       " 'Pk and his wife were very welcoming. I was impressed at how quickly Pk responded to my initial inquiry as well as follow-up questions. The apartment was easy to find with doorstep access to public transport to down town. I enjoyed the area the apartment was in itself and had dinner in a El Salvadorian restaurent a short walk away from the apartment. Everything was as described and could easily relax. This was my first AirBnB experience which was very positive.',\n",
       " \"I liked PK's place! Very cosy and comfortable room, nice spacious apartment, and PK is very hospitable. Looking forward to return to San Francisco and try to stay at his place.\",\n",

       " 'The hosts were nice and the home was clean',\n",
       " 'Pk was a great host. He has clean apartment with the  nice and cozy guest room. The Bart is just in 10 minutes to walk, so it was very convenient place for me. Nice place, great host! :)',\n",
       " \"Pk is a very thoughtful, friendly people. The room is super clean. The bed is very cozy. Far better than the hotels. Living here make me like live  a friend's place. We can talk, understand each other. Very good experience. I will recommend my friend choose your place to live when they travel to SF.\",\n",
       " \"Pk made me feel welcomed the second I walked into his home. I can't stress enough how genuine, welcoming and friendly him and his wife were. This has been the best AirBnb experience I've had and I will recommend Pk's residence to anyone. The place is clean, quiet, has all the amenities one needs during their travels.\\r\\n\",\n",
       " 'Pk was very easy to communicate with and contact upon arrival. The room was clean and we enjoyed our several nights there. The BART is a 10min walk and was fine every day. We were also able to leave our car parked on the street no problem. It was a great experience.',\n",
       " 'PK is a great host. The house is located in a very good neighbourhood of mission. A lot of restaurants of different cuisine are just across the street. The entire house is very clean and spacious. PK is very sensible guy and will be there to help you with all the information that you may need being a new guy in the city. I highly recommend his place for any airbnb guy looking for a place to live .',\n",

       "'the place was clean and spacious and the guy there was pretty nice and helpful. only thing was that the old lady charged me $25 for keeping my luggage for 5 hours.  this place wasn\\'t as pleasant as we hoped. had a strong smell throughout the hotel. our room was hot and and the room was a bit cluttered. other than that it\\'s ok for a last minute stay and the location is great.nice room, cool neighbourhood. note that this is a hotelthe listing was accurate and the location was very good. there was a slight smell of curry in the hallways but it was never in our room and it never bothered us all too much! also it was very hot at night so we left our windows open so we heard a lot of noise, but it was manageable!\\r\\nthe check in and out was quick and easy- maybe a little abrupt but everything that was needed was achieved.\\r\\nthe wifi password was readily available and the signal was strong!\\r\\nwe thought the pricing was maybe a little pricy but the area was good with lots of good places to eat nearby and the transport links were great! the 14 muni was two blacks away on mission street and that takes you straight downtown.\\r\\ni would definitely recommend this place for someone looking for basic, last-minute accommodation in a good location!great location!there is very little host interaction since you\\'re checking in at a hotel, but they were nice enough. i enjoyed the ease of coming and going with a key card, but otherwise did not enjoy my stay. my room was extremely tiny, extremely loud, too bright for sleeping in at night, stuffy and hot, with a deeply uncomfortable bed complete with uber-sterile hotel sheets. definitely not worth the money.very good place. it is very clean and quiet. it has a very good position, you can get very easy everywhere you want in san francisco. i loved that on valencia street you have a lot of bars, caffes and restaurants from where to choose. very good place, i recommend it to everybody who wants to see san francisco. definetly i will come back again.great location, comfy room. accommodating host. \\r\\n\\r\\nroom was a little warm, but it was a very hot day. note that this room is in an actual hotel. it was plain but nice - decent furniture, quite clean. it\\'s on a street with numerous good restaurants, shops, and bars, and i felt safe walking back from the bart at night. our room had a fair amount of noise from the street, so i recommend earplugs if you\\'re sensitive to noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe owners were very friendly and helpful. the only trouble we had is that, mid-way through our stay, they asked us to change rooms to accommodate another guest - and they wanted to put me and my co-worker in a room with only one bed. they tried hard to persuade us to do this, and didn\\'t seem to understand why this wasn\\'t acceptable to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nother than that, our stay was lovely.great location. there are a lot of good places to eat and go out in this area. room was in great shape and beds were comfortable. super reasonable price and host was friendly. the only difficult aspect was parking! we got really lucky but spent about 30 minutes driving around for a spot.nice place, cool part of town comfy, worth the price!room was in a hotel, small rooms with hawaiian decor. bathroom had no mirror but was very clean. beds were comfortable and relatively clean (some hairs on pillows etc). very safe building.  little to no interaction with hosts. strong smells in hallway but not rooms.  we had friends from town who met us for dinner and they were not allowed to join us in the room (very strict 4 people only). communication with host was difficult. great place. located centrally in the mission. very welcoming staff with super easy check in. clean rooms, good views, very reasonably priced. stayed there with a couple of friends.\\nthe hotel was clean and nice.\\nthe bathroom was missing a mirror and they didn\\'t give us enough towels even though we requested some.\\nthe location was fine, some nice bars right across the street and some really nice places to have breakfast too.it\\'s a walk up so if you have a ton of luggage,it\\'s kind of a nightmare. the whole building smelled like indian food. room was clean,bed was comfy but it was hot in there. no light in the bathroom & just a tiny mirror...also,i parked down the block and someone smashed my window in.great stay with a central location. the room was extremely clean literally spotless. if you\\'re looking for cheap accommodation in san fran this is it!  this location is fantastic. it\\'s basically a hawaiian/tropical themed hotel. great if you just need a place to crash while exploring the city.the hotel is located on a medium busy street with lots of shops and little restaurants. it\\'s a fun located be stay at when you are visiting the city. the description of the hotel on airbnb is accurate, its nothing more than a small hotel. when you enter you have to check in to get a key to the room. the hotel and our room was clean and tidy, and the room had everything we wanted for a short stay. the beds are nice and the shower was great! and what was really cool, was that that the whole hotel, including our room, was painted in bright colors like yellow and green. it gave a very modern feeling.the room is actually in a hotel, which is not a bad thing at all. great location and the whole building is clean and nice. check-in was quick and the room was surprisingly quiet for being right on valencia st. look forward to staying here again next time we\\'re in sf!great value for san francisco! the rooms were clean, our check in/out was flexible, and we had a nice view of the mission neighborhood. (which did also mean a lot of noise at night from the neighborhood). the rooms are centrally located in the mission, and surrounded by a lot of awesome bars and restaurants. also, only two blocks away from a bart stop, which was very convenient.  my only major complaint was due to the lack of mirrors in our room, which made getting ready difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, a really great accommodation for the price they\\'re charging. would definitely recommend for someone looking for a cheap but safe place to stay in sf. great location, clean, safe, and affordable. one of the few hotels in the mission like this! very simple with 2 double beds. much like others have stated, the mirror isn\\'t mounted on the wall which makes getting ready challenging and somewhat dangerous as our mirror shattered because of the unstable placement. the mirror was replaced with an analogous set up without any fuss - this probably happens all the time. the desk service was spotty but sufficient. enjoyed staying here!it was clean. great location. unfortunately we did not get a chance to stay here due to some last minute changes in our trip.  she was still very kind and reached out to us.  would recommend!it\\'s not the best motel in town.  smelled like strong and annoying curry odour  when you walk from and to the room. rooms were clean though. comphy beds clean sheets but covers were not the cleanest.  some had holes in them.  no parking or street parking only.  checking in was easy. very basic rooms. location is good. you get what you pay for. ...two of my friends got rash from sitting on the carpet. that\\'s a significant no thank you i won\\'t be back to this property. and we paid $334 plus $160 for extra persons for one night (jun27-28). our part is to choosing this location to be close to dolores park for friends hang out in sf for the weekend. felt lacking of generosity and hospitality from the host since the tone of voice and no gratuity to guests. host made me waited about 10 minutes or so to take care of a little kid in the restroom in her office and called this property a hotel. and the reason i didn\\'t have second room for extra peeps in my group is first time i asked, host said same as i paid ($334). i called in to her office number to check if the price was just her made up price. and $287 was offered. i tried to confirm my stay multiple times, made phone calls, and sent messages. i did not hear back from the host once. ended up not staying there. judy was an attentive host.  she made my experience quite pleasant.  i had a comfortable bed in a sizable bedroom with a large, attached bathroom.  judy gave me a brief tour and pointed out items that were important to me.  the bathroom was outfitted with amenities that you would find in a hotel room (soap, body wash, lotion, mouthwash, plenty of towels and face cloths).  the room was also outfitted with an iron and iron board.  the room had cable with a fairly sizable flat screen tv.  judy would periodically text me and ask if i had additional requirements or needed fresh towels.  she also recommended a restaurant.  i highly recommend her place to anyone who is traveling to the area.  the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.lovely spacious apartment in a neat neighborhood. just a few streets over from chinatown and down the street from the cable car museum. because the living/dining/kitchen area has ample seating and attractive decor we were able to invite a couple of business associates over for a short, impromptu meeting which was beneficial in preparation for our client meetings the next day.this was a wonderful rental for a family of 6.  laurie was quick to respond and gave us all the necessary information for an easy and no stress stay.  the flat was just as described in the listing.  wonderful location.laurie was a very attentive and generous host.  the flat was phenomenal, well-appointed and even better than the pictures.  the location is amazing and you really feel like a local when staying here.  i\\'d highly recommend it for your next visit to san fran.very nice apartment in a cool and quite neighborhood. \\nhighly recommended spot.\\nlaurie was very clear in the instructions and we had no problems getting into the property.\\r\\n\\r\\nit met our needs just fine.  we were 3 business people needing accomodation in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nnote that 2 of the bedrooms are in the basement and one is a loft so it\\'s functional but not beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighbourhood is great - easy walk to north beach, chinatown or union square.  harder to walk up the hill from the south side as are all properties on knob hill.our quick business trip to sf was great!  the space is exactly as it appears in the pictures, though there are some small unfinished items like a missing 2nd shower-head in the main bathroom (but who really needs 2 shower-heads anyway).  the living room / kitchen area is huge and can accommodate a large number of guests comfortably.  there are 2 beds in a loft over the living room and 2 bedrooms in the basement.  i would stay here again next time i come to sf.was fairly easy to get the keys.  great location.  safe.  that said, could have felt cleaner.  also, did not feel like the unit/building was used to abnb.i booked this on behalf of a colleague who needed a place to stay before his visa cleared, daniel was very informative and prompt with responses. he was very helpful when i had questions before their arrival. i did not see or stay at the place, but the tenants had no complaints. they said it was very clean, exactly like the pictures, and in a great location. very positive experience. thanks, daniel. the check in process was very easy and the home is very clean, comfortable and modern. very cool design in an awesome location! i had a nice week-long stay at daniel\\'s apartment in the mission. the apartment has plenty of space and is impressively decorated. there\\'s plenty to do in the neighborhood (daniel provided an extensive list of nearby restaurants, bars, and attractions) and bart is just a couple blocks away. i\\'d definitely recommend staying here.daniel\\'s apartment was clean, comfortable, welcoming, and near some of sf\\'s most interesting neighborhoods. daniel himself was incredibly accommodating and professional. on top of all that, his 45-page eating and shopping guide led me to what have become some of my favorite spots in the city. (please, please go to the royal cuckoo for a drink. it\\'s wonderful and only a couple of blocks away!) absolutely recommended. daniel was very welcoming and a lot of fun to meet and chat with upon our arrival. his house was beautiful, impeccably clean and very comfortable. location was amazing - quiet street in the heart of the mission, walking distance to everything you could want: restaurants, bart, etc. can\\'t wait to visit again soon. the only downfall was suffering from real estate envy of this amazing place!daniels home lived up to the posting, and so much more. it was a gorgeous flat, with an amazing-at home feel, while still having the pampered touches of staying at a hotel. the place was extremely clean, both beds were super comfy, and the neighborhood  was quiet enough to sleep-in passed 10am.\\r\\n\\r\\ndaniel was extremely accommodating, checking in once in a while to make sure when were able to check-in alright, or if their was anything we needed.\\r\\n\\r\\non my next weekend trip up to sf, i have no doubt that i\\'ll be looking for daniels flat again to stay at! best airbnb experience to-date!amazing place, so clean and nice. perfectdaniel was a great host. he responded quickly to our messages and had a lot of really good recommendations about the area. the place was lovely, in an amazing part of town, and really helped make this a wonderful trip. daniels home was clean spacious and in a great location. he was quick to answer all questions and provided a list of recommendation in all categories! it is so pleasant to have such a hospitable host! would definitwly recommend this bnb to friends and stay again in the future. val kept a great communication since the beginning, she was very friendly and careful to make the person staying at her place welcome. i booked her place for a person that i invited for an interview at my startup, i will definitely recommend val and try to book her place when the opportunity arises. thank you!  enjoyed spending a few days in val\\'s place. she was a perfect host, balancing friendliness with giving us privacy, had great suggestions for things to see, theater food, walks etc. the house is lovely and in perfect shape. parking up front made it easy to get in and out, and about san francisco, though the house\\'s proximity to the bart station made it very easy to get into town and about without the hassles of parking. everything was great about this listing!i stayed with val in the green room for 5 weeks and my experience was nothing short of absolutely freaking amazing!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space\\r\\nthe green room was exactly what i was looking for. it\\'s comfy and homely yet practical - allowing me to set up my laptop to answer emails, (sensitive contents hidden), etc. the bed is super comfortable, there\\'s a closet, hooks, plenty of draws and a tv hooked up to apple tv (which i only used once because of the awesome projector in the lounge - see below). the guest bathroom is right next door to the bedroom with an bath/shower, lots of soft towels and even shampoo and conditioner supplied. all the photos in the listing are exactly how the space is. and this is only the beginning. val\\'s apartment is beautifully decorated and unique - lots of art on the walls, janet jackson printed blinds, big kitchen, lovely sunny outdoor deck. my favourite part is her awesome tv projector, big screen and surround sound in the lounge room. i don\\'t know how i\\'m going to go back to watching house of cards on a regular tv. i\\'m ruined!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location\\r\\nthe mission is hands down the coolest area in sf. it\\'s warm, full of colour, music and life. as they say - \"it\\'s always sunny in the mission\". i never once felt unsafe, even when walking around at night, and i\\'m a 5\\'1 aussie girl. there is an endless choice of bars and restaurants to try, and taquerias as far as the eye can see. you haven\\'t had a burrito until you try a mission burrito. when i wasn\\'t eating delicious food, i went to a few yoga classes at yoga tree on valencia or walked up to bernal heights park - both a stones throw from val\\'s. but most importantly, val\\'s apartment is a 2 min walk from 24th mission bart, which gets you into downtown in literally 5 mins flat. i caught the bart from sfo to val\\'s when i first arrived and during my stay i commuted to and from soma on most days. getting around on public transport from the mission to anywhere in the city was dead easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nval and lou doggs\\r\\nval is san francisco personified. she is vibrant, beautiful, friendly, smart, successful and incredibly funny. she took me out for a drink on my first night and i knew immediately i had chosen the perfect place. lou is the most gorgeous and affectionate dog you\\'re ever meet. he loves people, cuddles and will melt your heart immediately. val has written a guide to sf for her guests which gives you advice into what to do and where to go from a local. she had the perfect balance of hanging out while also leaving you to do your own thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nin closing, if you want a genuine sf experience in a beautiful home with one of the most unique people you\\'ll ever meet, look no further. you\\'ve just found it.me and my friend had a great stay in the green rom. val was the perfect host, and the appartment was clean and had everything u needed, and more. even better then the pictures, if possible. it was sentral, with a parking spot right outside the house. highly recommended, we will come again next time we visit sf!perfectly located close to the bart and in the bustling mission district, great room in a quiet spot in a lovely apartment. val herself was super welcoming and lovely, and showed me around personally, it was like staying with an old friend. puppy cuddles as an added bonus! cannot recommend highly enough, wonderful experience!i stayed in val\\'s green room for three days with my girlfriend. it was my first time booking through airbnb and i couldn\\'t have been happier. first of all the yellow vic is located in a great neighborhood. the mission is bright, fun, has great food, and the bart station is less than a five minute walk away. you can be downtown in ten minutes. you can also walk to many great places (parks, restaurants, stores, etc). the house was easy to find and had a parking space right in front which was so convenient. the room was clean, comfortable, had natural light,  closet space, drawers, a tv, and a great wall color. which doesn\\'t surprise me now that i know val. val is detailed in everything she does. her apartment is clean, well decorated, modern yet cozy.  she left us a binder with instructions on how to use the tv, apple tv, projector, etc, places to check out and things to do in sf. she was also available to answer our questions both in person and through text. val knows when to respect your privacy but remains attentive of your needs. she was helpful, sweet and funny. really funny. we had the pleasure of going out with her on our last night. last but not least, val has the most lovable dog, lou. he minds his own but won\\'t turn down a cuddle if you ask. i would definitely recommend the green room and stay there again. \\r\\nwe had a fantastic stay in val\\'s green room. the unit is located in an awesome part of san francisco, away from the touristy parts but not completely twisted and weird like others. val\\'s unit is immaculate and the room is very spacious, clean and comfortable! val is a great host who genuinely loves having people to entertain. her local knowledge was invaluable and you\\'ll definitely find the best places to eat and drink with her advice.  her dog lou also has to be the coolest dog in the city. we\\'d recommend staying with val and would do it again! thank you!val\\'s home is just like in the photos, bright, colorful and we felt really comfortable, thank you for making us feel so welcome!\\r\\nval is a great person, she is full of energy and was very generous with her time and knowledge, she gave us plenty of great recommendations, showed us around the city and her apartment is amazing with a beautiful terrace in the mission. her dog lou is the really friendly and he made us fee very welcome too!\\r\\nthe location is great, really close to lots of nice places to eat.\\r\\nwe had a really nice time and having a nice friendly place to go home to every night was half of the fun :)\\r\\nthank you!!!! xxx\\r\\nit was a great experience at val\\'s. her place is really nice, neat and clean. val is an amazing hostess and her suggestions to go around were really helpful, would definitely recommend to everyone. i had a great time staying with val and lou the dog in val\\'s beautiful listing. val not only provided a clean and well decorated place for me to stay, also took me out to see the real mission. lou is a great dog. he greets me every night when i\\'m home . i will miss them a lot but will definitely come back to stay here again!val and her place were both brilliant. my friend and i felt very welcome straight away and had lots of fun with val. her dog lou is amazing, so friendly and lovely- we fell in love with him. it\\'s a great location for discovering the city, with loads of awesome places on the doorstep and val has put together a great guide to the city together. would definitely recommend val was great! she wasn\\'t able to be at the apartment when we got there, but she left very clear instructions. she was great about contacting us. the apartment and room were awesome and exactly as pictured and described. it\\'s a beautiful apartment and val is a great host with lots of great recommendations. even better was getting to pet lou, her dog. \\r\\ni highly recommend staying in the green room!we had an excellent experience staying with val! her place is extremely easy to get to from the airport, just a block from the bart. from there you can walk to a ton of great bars and places to eat. definitely take advantage of the binder; val\\'s got great recommendations in there and we found some gems using it. val is super chill and it was easy to do our own thing or hang out with her. her dog lou is the sweetest! val is a really nice, generous, warm, genuine and friendly person. from the moment i walked in the door i felt immediately welcome and comfortable sharing her home, which is a rare and magical thing. she is rad. also lou the dog is super cool and chill.\\r\\n\\r\\nval\\'s place is great too. perfectly situated in the mission, it\\'s close to lots of great food, bars, cool stores, and a strange performance art popup i didn\\'t understand. and it\\'s just 5 minutes from the bart station, which makes going downtown and entry/egress from sfo very easy and fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is bright, modern, colourful and full of interesting art and artifacts. there\\'s a nice backyard, everything was super clean, there are modern appliances including a good washer and dryer, and there is a straight up baller projector in the living room. the bathroom was both cleaner and larger than my apartment. most critically, you can buy booze around the corner until late at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you are browsing around airbnb hemming and hawing you can stop now. you found the right place.staying at val\\'s was perfect and such a pleasure for me. it was like staying at home with a really cool roommate--coming home at the end of my day was always a joy. the room is cozy, clean, and has lots of empty space for me to store my things. the private bathroom has a great condition also. \\r\\nval\\'s dog, lou, was such a pleasure to be with. he\\'s very friendly, loved to be petted, does not bark at all. i loved spending time with him during my stay.\\r\\nit is right at the heart of mission and most of the cool shops and restaurants are within the walking distance. if you like burritos, the best burrito place in town is right on the next street, about 3 minutes walk. the neighborhood is also well connected with public transport, with lots of muni buses on mission street and a bart station right around the corner from val\\'s place.\\r\\ni can definitely see myself returning to val\\'s place the next time i\\'m in sf. \\r\\nthe apartment is in a pretty excellent location and the view is just as good as purported.  patrick was very accommodating in our arrival and departure times  and his roommates were very friendly and welcoming. \\r\\nthere were a few small hiccups but overall it was a pleasant place to sleep after a few long days of exploring the city and a good deal for the price.  highly recommended! the host is very nice and convenient to contact. they prepare welcome letter before we arrive and small gift for our family. the house is super clean and well decorated, feel like home. there are lots of toys and kids\\' books and my boy loves them a lot. the kitchen has everything. shail provided us with everything we needed for our san francisco experience. their home was spotless and they even provided coloring books and a treat for our kids.location is good. kids room is funny .although i did not meet him personally during my stay, lenza was a very helpful and courteous host. his apartment is spacious and clean. if you wish to stay in the mission district, you can\\'t do better than this! thanks lenza!lenza\\'s place was clean, minimally decorated, and in a great location (very near one of the best bakeries in the city!). the bed was comfy and the room was quiet, making for a great night\\'s sleep. we didn\\'t meet lenza as he was traveling, but he was very responsive and made getting access to the apartment easy. lenza\\'s place is smack bang in one of the best parts of the mission, if you ask me.  it\\'s a block from mission dolores park.  it\\'s next to delfina and pizza delfina - very fine restaurants indeed.  it\\'s next to birite, a stunning bakery, and less than 2 blocks from all sorts of great eateries.  it\\'s a really spacious place with a huge living room, big sofa, open plan kitchen, etc.  guests have a dedicated bathroom too.  the bed linen was really nice too, ditto with the towels - things like this add up to a comfortable happy airbnb experience.  lenza is a great guy who is good to talk to, and a clear communicator too (another important factor in being a good airbnb host).  the place is quiet, peaceful, it\\'s easy to get a good night\\'s sleep, and the neighbourhood felt really safe.  easily one of the best happiest visits i\\'ve had to sf.superb neighbourhood and location, with delfina and bi-rite next door. the service from the host was great, from sharing a beer one night to being available and flexible when needed.great location!  situated near dolores park with a number of prime food options. a number of our friends that love in sf stayed in the vicinity of lenza\\'s place.  great location for a a pride weekend. easy access to public transit. would definitely stay here again. amazing location right next to dolores park and bi-rite, huge apartment, the  room is spacious and quiet and has a little balcony. it was great having my own bathroom and the washer-dryer came in very handy.lenza is awesome and his place is great. dope location too!lenza was a great host - i had a super stay at his place. we didn\\'t end up seeing each other that often as i was working a lot during my stay, but he welcomed me for dinner with friends on the weekend and it was fun to hang out. the location is fantastic, and the room is large and comfortable. i ended up extending my stay for a few days - thanks for having me!i had an excellent stay at lenza\\'s place. this is my first airbnb experience, and it was great. lenza was very helpful and accommodating when my flight was delayed. i felt comfortable and welcome when he and his girlfriend were in the apartment, but i also had my privacy and i often had the apartment to myself. the neighborhood is excellent - you are right by dolores park, and in the thick of the exciting mission neighborhood one block from lots of great bars and restaurants. the bed is extremely comfortable, and the apartment is modern and clean. from the time i first contacted lenza until the day i left, the experience was wonderful. the apartment, which is located on one of the best blocks in san francisco, was larger than i was expecting (i thought sf apartments were supposed to be tiny?). there is a very large kitchen/dining room/living room area- which i always felt at home in (even if lenza and his girlfriend were around). the bedroom is located at the opposite end of the apartment and is spacious and extremely quiet (you\\'ll never hear any street noise at all). the bed was comfortable, the sheets and towels were soft, and there is even a small terrace connected to the bedroom if you want some fresh air.\\r\\n\\r\\nbonuses: bi-rite market (small grocery store) is located right downstairs, tartine bakery is a half block away, dolores park a block away, less than a 5 minute walk to countless restaurants/coffee shops/shops.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, i would jump at the chance to stay here again. i love lenza! super nice (he carried my enormous luggage up the stairs for me) and responsive. he gave me advice and ideas where to go and was very welcoming. the environment is causal and laid-back, so if you\\'re looking for something chill, it\\'s perfect. i had a really great stay with lenza. like other reviewers have said, the location of his apt is unbeatable: dolores park, bi-rite market, tartine, and delfina are on his block.  the apartment and bedroom were very spacious, especially for sf standards. the bed was very comfortable and i slept well every night during my week-long stay. lenza was an awesome host.  he\\'s super laid back and accommodating; he made me feel right at home. i would highly recommend staying with lenza if you visit sf.  thanks, man!lenza is a nice guy very welcoming. as soon as i reached his listing, he did toured me around the area and briefed me on the places to eat and go to. i stayed for 2 weeks in his place and all i can say is i felt home, from the comfy bed, spacious bathroom, and gorgeous living room. \\r\\n\\r\\nif given a chance to go back in sf, i will book his listing again :)this apartment is on the best block in san francisco.\\r\\n+tartine (best pastries in the city, possibly the world. try the morning bun)\\r\\n+delfina pizzeria (the off-menu magic pie was great. thanks for the tip, lenza)\\r\\n+bi-rite and bi-rite creamery (awesome grocery store and ice cream shop)\\r\\n+right next to dolores park\\r\\n\\r\\nvery easy to get access to the apartment (a key lock had the key inside). the apartment is sweet. it has a huge living room / kitchen area. i had my own bathroom. washer and dryer in the unit and the maid washed and folded my clothes for me. i don\\'t think i will ever stay in a hotel in sf again honestly.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was clean, smelled good, and there was a welcome gift for me on the nightstand. very much appreciated!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host, lenza, is awesome. really funny. he had great recommendations for dinner (including breaking down the top burrito options depending on which ingredients are most important to you).\\r\\n\\r\\nthis will be my first choice whenever i am back in sf.lenza\\'s space was in a perfect location in the mission neighborhood, a few blocks south of the noe district.  it is right next to the bi-rite grocery store -- a high end neighborhood version of whole foods, and just up the block from tartine bakery.  valencia street, one block away, is teaming with cool shops and restaurants.  we also spent some time at the spruced up mission dolores park.  lenza was very good about directions and assistance, and the space is exactly as advertised.  i\\'ve stayed in more than a few places in sf while in town, but i\\'m pretty sure this one takes the prize for best location. it\\'s close to the mission, market street and you can get pretty much wherever you need easily, which is worth it\\'s weight in hummus. there also happens to be a great market right below the place, which was a nice touch. \\r\\n\\r\\nlenza was super awesome and everything was set up for me once i got there. the room is huge and i had my own bathroom the entire time. he told me anything in the house was fair game (or that\\'s what it seemed like while i was there), so i was able to wash my clothes with his detergent and grab more than one of his beers from the fridge without feeling all guilty about it. \\r\\n\\r\\nif you can\\'t tell, i really liked this place and lenza is a total boss. stay here, you\\'ll like it. absolutely awesome - very good flat, very good location, very nice / easy to arrange, very pleasant. lenza is very nice. he answered all my questions and the check in was very smooth. the place is very nice and spacious. i wish i could have hung out in the apartment more but i was so busy. the area is the best in sf. i love it. quick drop-off of bags, key pick up and friendly host. the location just next to bi-rite and great food and delores park is a plus.lenza was an awesome host and i had a great stay. his apartment is perfectly located, with dolores park just one block away. inside, it\\'s spacious and well furnished. the bedroom itself was very homey and the bed very comfortable (more comfortable than my bed at home!). i\\'d recommend his place to anyone looking for a place to stay in the mission.this is kevin\\'s review: \"it was a nice big space, nice shower, nice kitchen, clean, minimal and quiet.  i met the owner’s girlfriend briefly, and talked to another renter a couple of times, but never meeting the owner gave the place a more hotel-ish feel which was fine for me.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni am glad that things worked so well and that lenza was always very communicative and helpful.lenza is so cool. he always was very supportive and suggest to me a lot of good places to eat. he is a really good guy, and his girlfriend and friends too. mission is pretty cool and shows you a great part of the city. lenza\\'s place was perfect. super comfortable, clean and in one of the best locations in the city. lenza welcomed me when i arrived and was available with any questions. the apartment is super spacious, lots of light. i especially liked having my own bathroom and ample closet space. the apartment is next door to some awesome restaurants including delfina, and bi-rite. delores park is steps away. thank you for a lovely stay lenza! might be the best room for rent in the city. great location, next to everything in the mission yet quiet and serene. lenza is extremely welcoming and a great host. the host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.julia lives just near the magnificent lake merced - the neighborhood is really safe and quiet. awesome stay. julia was very welcoming and the place was great. nice small bed separated from living room. very quiet inside and the neighborhood is quiet. right next to park merced. 5 starsjulia is a charm. i thoroughly enjoyed my stay. her family is very accomodating, relaxed, and fun. i highly recommend staying here.i travelled to sf just for a vacation, so i needed a place just to sleep over and take a shower. julia\\'s place was perfect for those reasons. \\r\\n\\r\\njulia was a very nice host. she would always offer me a ride back home or some food. even though i lived in a shared bedroom in her living room, it was separated by a partition, so i could get some privacy.  julia has two kids, but for most of the time it was pretty quite at her place, especially at night. julia was very flexible during my check in and check out.  this really helped decrease the stresses when visiting a city like san francisco.  she was very communicative and a very accommodating.  she upgraded the room to the upstairs master bedroom which was great.  what i liked the most was the value of the daily rental.  i would definitely stay again.  friendly & hospitable host. julia helped me find the place by meeting up when i arrived. she\\'s very nice and accomodating. the place is quite small but ok for a few days stay. thank you julia and good luck with everything!the house was very welcoming as i entered. the description of the unit was spot on. it was awesome that julia allowed me to check-in late at night when i got into town. i felt quite at home! thank you!excellent place!, good internet connection, very quiet and respectful environment, baths are new and clean, kitchen is available and fully equipped; and the host orlando made sure everything is under control and he was very helpful providing guidance about the city. this place is specially good if you travel while you work or study.easily accessible by muni l line. be aware of steep hill from taraval and 24th ave, will get yah! met with orlando who was very kind and explained house rules and suggested great places to eat nearby. great price and very quiet, and cozy place. upscale hostel experience. would definitely stay again.everything was amazing. couldn\\'t have asked for a better weekend. jan was super helpful and everything was so easyemerald was great. she always had a beer or tequila drink on deck when i returned to her place after attending the conference i was in town for. she also showed me around the city and showed me a great time, as well as some great youtube videos.the host canceled this reservation 96 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.my overall experience with nima and his apartment was fantastic. from the very beginning, he was very quick to respond to my inquiries and made himself available, had i needed him. the property itself is beautiful. the view of the city and the location is outstanding. very quiet neighborhood with lots of street parking. just be careful about the when you park because they do have street cleaning and they are very quick to ticket your vehicle. would  stay at this place again.we stayed for 2 nights during thanksgiving. prior to arrival, we\\'ve changed our plan and our eta to the apartment very many times but nima was nice enough to accommodate every single request we had on thanksgiving day. his apartment was cozy and farely clean. he did mention in the description that this was the home of his family for over 30 years so some features may not be the most uptodate but u can see that it has been taken care of nicely. the view outside of the balcony was excellent. street parking was easy.\\n\\noverall we had a very pleasant stay. thank you nima!nima was such a gracious host and made us feel welcomed. he was very accommodating, punctual, friendly & honest in his description. his grandmother is awesome also and she went above and beyond with making us feel comfortable by bringing us some snacks and flowers upon arrival. the view from the living room and balcony is absolutely breathtaking and i would definitely stay here again. this place is great for a family get away or a group of friends. it\\'s not far from restaurants and bars and there was plenty of parking in front of the building. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars for nima and his grandmother!!!! we couldn\\'t have asked for a better host and location to stay.  thanks again nima!good location, awesome view. nima was an ideal host, the house was amazing and he facilitated everything beautifully. nima was an awesome host. he was incredibly accommodating and even had the space cleaned a day early so that my group and i were able to come and stay a night early. the apartment was spacious and very comfortable even for a group of 8 people. we really enjoyed staying at nima\\'s place.nima happened to be out of town the night we came but provided directions to get the keys and was always available in case we needed anything. the apartment was amazing - a little outdated, but super spacious and in a great location overlooking the entire city (views are incredible!!!) and the free street parking was a huge help. nima even left sodas and waters for us which was really nice. ill definitely stay here again when in the city as it was a far better deal and experience than staying in hotels. nima is so warm heart , he ask what we need every day , he wants us to have a good stay in sf , thanks , his apartment is so cool , it could view sf city in a good sighting . and it cost at most 3 mins to market street which is the biggest and main street in sf , we would come again next year .this was a great place to stay!  nima called to let me know how to get into the appartment and to let me know he would be out of town that weekend, but made sure i had his phone number in case we needed anything.  the neighborhood is really nice and very safe.  we were able to easily walk from the house to castro street to go out at night because it\\'s down hill and only about a mile away.  the cab ride back at night was pretty cheap.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe views are phenomenal from the apartment and everything was very clean when we showed up.  i will definitely stay here again.  when i order the apartment, nima contact with me immediately. and before i came to san fransisco. he sent me a specific direction about how to access to the apartment and some basic information about it. it\\'s very specific and helpful. the scenery is fantastic, you can see san fransisco downtown in the balcony. the rooms in apartment are clean and comfortable. in one word, this apartment is a very nice choice, it makes you feel like home and gives you a wonderful stay here.\\r\\neverything was in order and the view was awesome. nima checked back with us on a daily basis to ensure everything was okay.cool apartment, nice experience. nima is really a warmhearted guy, he drove a long way to send us a spare key at midnight when we were accidentally locked out, without any complains. thanks so much.the place was in good shape and the view was absolutely amazing! nima and his mother were very welcoming and helpful, they were quick to respond to our questions and help out. my family had a great time staying there. the neighborhood was great and pretty accessible to tourist locations (we mainly used uber to get around). nima was a great host! we had a wonderful time in this apartment high above the city. the views are amazing, and the apartment was perfect for our group. nma was an awesome host and was there for us every step of the way answering any questions we had. the view of the city was one that i will be dreaming about.  we are so glad that we chose this place to stay.the apartment had the most amazing views of sf. nima was a great host who gave excellent instructions on accessing the property and was available whenever needed. he was also very accommodating on a surprise visit from my two friends from australia...i was kept in the dark by all concerned ! property was clean and tidy and i would not hesitate to stay at nima\\'s apartment again whenever i\\'m in sf. i will definitely return - great city, great people !we really enjoyed our 2 night stay in this accommodation. it was clean and tidy and had everything we required. the views from the balcony over san francisco were unbelievable and certainly the highlight of this accommodation. would recommend to friends and would stay there again myself.nima gave us a welcome by email. we never saw him but he stayed in touch by email and text the first couple of days asking us if there was anything we needed. answered our questions promptly. nima let us know that our experience mattered and he wanted to make it the best it could be. really nice and comfortable place. quite neighborhood. we really enjoyed our stay.host kept in contact regularly and was very accommodating around arrival time. flat very spacious and superb view of th city, being in the twin peaks. amazing! nicole was accommodating, and very understanding of this being my first time using the app. highly recommend nicole to anyone looking for a nice, clean, cozy place to stay in san francisco.nicole\\'s place was in a quiet, safe neighborhood.  the unit was clean and nicole was accommodating with the timing of my arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe unit would be just fine for many airbnb people.  i\\'m very sensitive to the feel of the space and it was not a fit for me.  nicole is new to airbnb and i hope that in the time ahead she will make the space more inviting and cozy, with attention to detail and amenities that would make the home feel welcoming and warm.this location was easily accessible from the 101 and golden gate bridge, about a 15 minute drive to fisherman\\'s wharf and chinatown. nicole waited up for us even when we arrived well into the night, she was very accommodating! sleeping quarters were very comfortable, nothing too fancy but definitely you get your money\\'s worth in expensive san francisco! thank you nicole! very nice, cozy place. nicole was very accommodating and extremely nice. she made us feel welcome and also respected our privacy. i would definitely recommend staying with nicole!nicole was a great host! nice house we had a good time! quiet area and easy parkingwe (4 guys) enjoyed our stay at nicoles house. she was a great host for our first experiece with airbnb. the house where clean and the location is very quiet nevertheless just 30 min to downtown. only 100m to trainstation. the price-performance ratio for this area is great. she helped us to get a lost phone back. thx for that.nicole was a nice host. she met me when i arrived, showed me around, made sure i had what i needed, and then i had the place to myself. we had a wonderful stay at nicole\\'s place in the sunset district of san francisco. the neighborhood was quiet and had plenty of parking and the room had a great ocean view!\\n\\nthe unit is a downstairs unit that has everything you need for a short stay in san francisco. all the necessary appliances and could probably sleep six if you are willing to share the space. we felt safe and secure while staying there, unlike other sf neighborhoods/places we\\'ve stayed in.\\n\\nall in all a solid place to stay in a nice location.very nice and big flat with everything you need in the kitchen or the bathroom.\\r\\nthe localisation was perfect.\\r\\nnicole was very kind and helpful with us. if you have any questions or problems you can be sure that she will help you!nicole greeted us and made us feel welcomed and had flexible cancellation when our plans changed; this is a great location in a safe neighborhood with easy parking; convenient to public transportation and going to north bay.  nice kitchen with full fridge; nice that there was separate bedroom with door and separate bathroom with door besides sofa area with kitchen table and nice desk; nicole is a lively and welcoming host. however, the apartment still needs to improve to make it an enjoyable experience for airbnb guests.  the best thing about the apartment is the that it\\'s only a block away from the muni stop which takes you straight into the heart of downtown sf and transportation via uberpool, to and from the apartment, is cheap. there is also an ocean view from the bedroom which is visible on very clear days.  other than the above mentioned there is not much else that i enjoyed about the place.  the bed is very bouncy and not comfortable and the sheets are itchy. bring your own towels! the towels provided leave pink fuss all over your body and get stuck in your hair. my boyfriend preferred to use t-shirts to dry off after showers.  after two nights of sleeping there and using the towels, both my boyfriend and i woke up with some itchy bumps on our hands and arms. it may have been caused by something unrelated to the bed or towels but the signs point to a strong correlation. finally, nicole did not mention a check out time and although airbnb provides guidelines for check out times, as an airbnb host myself, i always discuss it ahead of time with my guests. on our last day, she contacted me 45 minutes before she needed us to check out because she had other guests coming in an hour later. communication is key in airbnb and it would have been good to know so that we had a little more time to get ready without being rushed. the rental is in a safe, quiet part of the city and has a nice ocean view. it was fairly clean besides the ants that made their way in on the second day. the parking was fairly easy as well. nicole is nice, but hard to comunicate with due to her poor english. she called us multiple times and was quite over bearing. we told her when we were arriving multiple times and she asked us to come earlier because she had to get her nails done. she also told us to bring our own towels. there was no soap provided to shower with. these are fundamental things that an airbnb should provide and a traveller shouldnt have to travel with. both the bed (advertised as a queen, but actually a double) and pullout sofa are extremely uncomfortable. when we got there she started complaining about the previous guest telling her that her pillow cases smelled bad and told us to smell them. no big deal, but annoying for sure. she obviously got new sheets, but did not wash them prior to our stay because they were pilling and getting fuzz all over us. the kitchen is not very funtional  and we had trouble getting the stove to work properly. half the lights in the kitchen and a few in the bathroom were burned out. there was no garden to speak of and she practically yelled at my girlfriend \"why do you need to go out there\" when she asked if we could go out back. overall not a horrible experience, but definitely falsely advertised, and we would not stay here again.the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.the house was good and the host was responsive. we mentioned the wifi was spotty and shortly after a new access point was installed. great host!i booked a group of ny dancers to stay at william\\'s place and they loved it! the proximity to many neighborhoods was key, and as they were scheduled to perform at sfmoma they could easily get to and from the apartment there for rehearsals and the event. william was a great host and we appreciate being able to have our dancers have a place to relax after many long days.we had a great time staying in this apartment right by market street. the place is newly renovated so everything was so fresh and new.  william was super helpful and always got back to me almost straight away to answer my questions excellent place to stay for a couple of nights in san francisco. very comfortable beds, nice kitchen, and everything was clean! it was very easy to find a parking spot on the street. convenient location, close to cafes, restaurants, and the streetcar, although we walked most of the time. when i go back to san francisco i will definitely rent william\\'s place again.\\r\\nloved the bed linen and easy entry! location on point!nice neighborhood and excellent location! several nightlife places are in walk distance and major grocery shop is just 2 blocks away\\r\\ncool, neat and clean place. very spacious and has all what you need. \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m giving it 4 stars only because the key was supposed to be at a lockbox at the door. it wasn\\'t there when we arrived so we had to wait for a while, then we needed to go someplace else and came back 2 hours later & the key was there. the description says it all, this was a great place, comfortable, and in a perfect spot. as a business traveler myself it offered all that we could ask for on a short trip up to sf. the home is beautiful and clean but directions could be clearer and host could be more hospitable. couldn\\'t find the garage so we parked on the streets. there was an used bottle of acai juice on the steps by the door, thought it was our welcome gift but could just be someone\\'s trash, lol.it was a great listing! keith was awesome, communicated everything i needed to know and was easy to get a hold of. he let me know anything that he was doing involved in the stay.keith was very helpful getting us set-up at the place.  everything was prepared in advance and ready for our arrival.  the view from the dining room and back bedroom were great.  it\\'s a nice, quiet neighborhood, not far from buena vista park.stocked kitchen, pantry, bar, bathroom, and a personally curated guide to sf... keith had any and everything that we possibly could have needed. for a small team on a work trip, at the end of the day it felt like a true home we were returning to.fantastic! if you ever go to sanfran with a group of 8-10 people, this is your go to place without a doubt! keith was just amazing! he had every possible thing you could think of in his place.. super impressed! definitely recommend this place to all :) keith was a great host, very helpful and accommodating. beautiful views, quiet neighborhood. we had a great stay!we had a great experience, the apartment was ready for us and had everything we needed.this is an incredible place to stay - beautifully decorated home with gorgeous views (outdoor deck with an amazing view of the bay). narry was an excellent host and was always available to answer any questions that we had. i highly recommend his home, and look forward to staying again. narry\\'s house is located at the top of a hill in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood overlooking the bay. the view from the roof deck is stunning and the house is very spacious, comfortable, clean and well equipped. we had a great time staying there and would recommend it to anyone. we\\'ll be back!narry is a fantastic host and his listing is ideal - right in the heart of pacific heights, clean, spacious, and an incredible roof terrace with a view spanning the bay. i highly recommend staying at this place if you get the chance.narry was a wonderful host. we fully enjoyed our stay at his lovely and beautiful house. the house is well furnished and equipped with all modern amenities. also narry was in regular touch with us to ensure that everything is properly taken care. we would love to visit san francisco again and stay at narry\\'s residence surely. since i was with family safety and peace was  of prime importance which this house surely provides. thanks narry. narry\\'s home is in a great location at the top of the hill overlooking the bay.  his home is clean, has a nice layout for privacy between guests and is well stocked with supplies and amenities.  narry was very helpful and communicative prior to arrival, through the stay and even after our return home.  stayed here last weekend for the outside lands festival. i had my family with me as well as my business partner and his girlfriend. the house is fantastic, it\\'s stocked with all the essentials and some of the best views in san francisco. \\r\\nas good as the house is working with narry was the real surprise. he was very attentive to us and checked in multiple times to make sure we were good. \\r\\nwe will for sure be staying here again, thanks narry!

out of their way to ensure my stay in their home and san francisco was exceptionally enjoyable and one i will never forget.  \\r\\nas a single female traveller and first time user of airbnb i felt extremely safe in their accommodation and in the area. the property is situated in a central location with only a short walk to union square and easy access to public transport. \\r\\nthe unit was spotlessly clean and exactly as the description described. i was also impressed that alex and liza provided the extra little touches such as shampoo and conditioner, an assortment of other personal items and san francisco guide books to assist with my stay. \\r\\ni was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the air mattress was and i must admit it was even more comfortable than my own

view was even better! could not say enough about the location and hospitality! i would absolutely refer her to anyone coming to sf! the place was clean. my family enjoyed their stayour group felt very welcomed. the home is very spacious and well put together. the home is located in a quiet neighborhood close to markets, stores and fast food restaurants. the only problem we encountered was parking and the wifi being a bit slow. other than everything else was great! i would definitely stay at this location again. we enjoyed staying in audrys apartment. coming from a nordic country we could expect a better heating solution (not specific for this apartment more us standard), noisy and difficult to get a stable temperature in all rooms. the neighbourhood was great and we always managed to find a parking lot for our car. we stayed 5 persons and it was 3 rooms that perfectly worked out for us. we used the kitchen for breakfast and 1 dinner. thanks and all the best to you audry!audrey\\'s place was perfect for a stay in the mission. it\\'s on a quiet safe street. my cousin left her speaker at the house and audry was responsive and helpful in getting it back. we booked audry\\'s place to house some of our employees visiting our office from out of town for a week and it was perfect! check in and check out instructions were clearly communicated and the place was fantastic! we would definitely book audry\\'s place again in the future.  thanks audry! :) audry and fran have been such great hosts! the apartment is very clean and very well equipped. the place is exactly as on the pictures (maybe it\\'s better than the pictures). the location is great also. we definitely recommend to stay there!audry and fran were gracious hosts. wonderful location, lots to see and do in walking distance. highly recommended. we had a great stay at audry\\'s flat.  the neighborhood is quiet but in a great part of bernal heights, right below mission, in walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars, and more.  having two bathrooms is great when you have several people staying.  the flat was clean and well stocked with everything you could need.  audry was helpful for anything needed but gave us plenty of privacy.  we loved it our stay and would recommend to anyone!!we have great host by audry. it\\'s really great place. i could not forgot this journey. we got to audry\\'s house a little earlier than we anticipated but that didn\\'t stop her from greeting us warmly and with tons of advice and san francisco tid-bits. you can really sense how passionate sheiks about her city by the bay. we like to airbnb instead of traditional hotels \\'cause we like the feel of being a local and you get that here. bernal heights is just south of the mission and and a really cool neighborhood on its own. public transport is nearby and can get you wherever you want in due time. parking is a bit toughen the neighborhood but not impossible. we got a spot right outside the house and held onto it for the duration of our stay. the house itself is exactly as described and shown in the pictures. you get a great sun from the large windows in the front but good darkness in the back when you want to sleep. i would have no problem staying here again if i needed a place with at least three bedrooms. the best thing about audry\\'s place is all the information she provides about one of the worlds great cities. very very nice host, and perfect house .\\r\\nvery clean and nicewow, great place and an even better host!  unit is very clean and comfortable. it is centrally located in the city. short walk to some great restaurants and bars.  audry was helpful with recommendations.  i look forward to going back her next time i\\'m in san francisco.  great place to stay: nice clean victorian house with plenty of beds.audry was wonderful, attentive, kind, and communicative! her place was perfect for our stay. we loved the bay window, immaculate kitchen, spacious bedrooms, and great shower water pressure! audry and fran were wonderful! their home was open, airy, clean, and they were friendly. i visited with my entire family and we all truly enjoyed staying at their place. great location near the freeway, bart, and downtown. quiet neighborhood and overall great place to stay.this was a great place to stay.  we had 9 in our party and were very comfortable. audry and fran went over and above what we expected in welcoming us and making us feel like it was our own home.  well supplied kitchen, plenty of linens and blankets.  they were able to point us in the right direction for any of the things we needed to purchase.  plenty of places within walking distance for groceries and prepared meals, too.great host and great house! i booked this listing for my aunt and her friends (they were a group of 9 lovely 60+ women). as soon as they arrived they sent me photos saying everything was beautiful and that the location of the flat was perfect, safe and very picteresque. audry was lovely and very patient with me, as i had to ask her a million strange questions that the ladies wanted to know. she answered everything diligently and kindly. no complaints at all.audry and fran\\'s flat was absolutely perfect! very accessible to public transit (the bart is only a 10 minute walk), restaurants, bars, parks, yoga, etc. we couldn\\'t have been more pleased with the cleanliness and homeyness of the flat itself, too. there\\'s quite a bit of space to spread out if your group is larger. i will definitely be back!audrey & fran were such a nice host. the house was super clean and everything was organized. my family loved the house as well. we\\'ll surely be staying here again.really nice place and a warm welcome.\\r\\nthanks\\r\\nkarelaudry is very very nice! we had a big group of 8 people, but arrived at the different time. audry helped us to put our luggages inside the house before the check-in time. she is sweet and considerate. we asked her a lot of questions about san fransisco, she is very patient and easy to work with. we had a great time there. we\\'ll definitely come back again:-) the listing was super clean and comfortable, very quiet in the evening. audry provided soda water and really good dark chocolate for us. it was a great stay!audry\\'s house is really great.and she is a nice host, i\\'m sure that i will recommand to my friends who will go to san francisco \\nthe pictures don\\'t do it justice! filled with e natural light and beautiful open concept. \\r\\nthe kitchen is a cook\\'s dream with upgraded appliances and homey touches you just want to hang out in. deborah couldn\\'t do enough to make our stay fantastic and we\\'ll definitely book her house again on our next tripginny was a great host. she had snacks available for us when we arrived and tourist maps. the view was amazing. we had a great location. there was a safeway and starbucks less than a 5 min walk. there was a few bars walking distance. i was in town with a couple colleagues for a conference and we had a great time. if given the option i would definitely stay there again. fyi the pictures she has on the site don\\'t do this place justice. once you are there in person the house is way better than expected. virginia\\'s home was perfect for our group and the location is fantastic.  i\\'d definitely stay there again.great house, great location, spacious and perfect communication during the reservation process. brian met a couple of my colleagues that arrived first to the house. the place was amazing and exactly as described. since this is my first time using airbnb, this stay will be hard to top. amazing house and extremely quiet. there are a number of good restaurant and bars within walking distance.  the house is truly amazing, every bit as fabulous as the pictures. our host went above and beyond for us. offering wonderful amenities and suggestions for great places to go in the neighborhood. great restaurants and bars are just a couple blocks away and the sunday morning farmer\\'s market just one street over was a nice surprise. brian was extremely attentive to our needs and our team. he was diligent in his approach to make sure the house was ready upon arrival and was ever so accommodating when we had a scheduling mishap towards the end of our stay. the house was gorgeous, a block from one of the hippest areas in the city, and definitely spacious enough for 3 separate guests. i would stay here time and time again if i could!this house was literally the best airbnb we have stayed at by far.  the owner remodeled this home and has absolutely exquisite taste.  there is music throughout and the patio is fabulous.  if you don\\'t want music and would prefer quiet, this is a very well insulated quiet home.  i wish i had his kitchen in my own house!  brian is warm and helpful, and the location is great...you can walk to usf, the haight, the park, and several outstanding restaurants and bars.  highly recommended!!!amazing home! thank you for hosting us! brian made us feel welcome from the first day we booked to our last day at his place.  he is an out-going, friendly, upbeat, helpful person who obviously cared about our enjoyment, a little like an inn keeper.  he discussed the house, made recommendations about the neighborhood and, once we occupied, remained highly accessible by text, even though it was over christmas and he was celebrating the holiday with his loved ones too.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is actually better than described in the listing.  the pictures show brian\\'s exquisite taste but not the carrara marble throughout the kitchen, lr, and bathrooms.  the kitchen lr/dr, and master bedroom are larger.  the dr table, custom-made, has a thin bronze antiqued top cover.  the lr tv (60 inches?) is wall mounted with surround-sound.  also, the house has a sonos sound system installed throughout, and brian provides an iphone you can use to manage it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is in nopa, a pleasant, safe san francisco neighborhood.  it is situated on a quiet street opposite a fire station.  it is a short walk from alamo square, a lovely park bordering which are the somewhat famous \"painted ladies,\" and divisidero street, considered \"hip,\" if you are into that.  one of the few drawbacks of the house, if you bring a car, is that there is no garage and you must rely on not-too-plentiful street parking with two-hour limits 8 am to 6 pm, monday through friday, for those without a municipal daily parking pass.  however, brian does provide them at cost at $9 each.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe recommend brian and his lovely home, and give it five stars.loved the house..very clean, modern decor, private ...wonderful sound systmbrian\\'s home is gorgeous - we felt right at home in san francisco. great location, great amenities - he\\'s thought through every detail of the home. lot\\'s of cafes close by.  just wish we had more time to spend outside on the patio - it\\'s felt like we were at a spa.\\r\\nthanks for a relaxing place to rest our heads during superbowl weekend!brian\\'s home is impeccable. the place is beautifully furnished with a great style and every amenity imaginable provided for. and the location proved ideal. it was the most flawless guest experience i\\'ve ever enjoyed.the home was absolutely incredible!! stunning design while feeling like home. great spot in the city and easy to work with brian!\\r\\n\\r\\ncan\\'t wait to use the space again :)the home was lovely and inviting. loved all the organic product from detergent to soaps and lotions. being at brian\\'s home made a business trip seem more like a relaxing vacation. first experience with airbnb and it was great!\\r\\nthe house is beautiful and comfortable.  love the modern feel and extra appointments.  our host left us cookies, coffee, and a bottle of sparkling wine as a welcome gift.  sat around the fire with music surrounding us.  did yoga on the back patio.  \\r\\nso nice!  highly recommend this home.beautiful san francisco home.  amazing roof top patio.  we had a wonderful time!gianna\\'s location was amazing. the apartment is great, stylish, clean, comfortable  and welcoming. it is all what is advertised in the posting, a great location for our family. it felt like a home away from home. \\r\\n\\r\\ngianna left personal recommendations for local spots which were simple to understand and helpful. we liked the neighborhood very much, but it was also easy to get to other spots by public transportation (muni busses) or uber. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe beds were very comfortable. it was always quiet at night so we slept very well.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe never met gianna, but she was very accomodating with both an early check in and late luggage storage. great communication, she was very attentive and friendly.\\r\\nwe highly recommend gianna\\'s apartment.our stay was wonderful and everything was as promised -- and then some! the condo has a great layout, (perfect for two couples), a fantastic kitchen, and an ideal location for exploring local neighborhoods on foot as well as touring the rest of the city. gianna was a wonderful host and communicating with her was always easy. we would love to stay here again!!host was very welcoming and was available to answer questions. she left a very detailed manual which was very helpful.karen provided very detail house instructions to facilitate our living. it is really impressive! she always provides instant feedback on our enquiry (within one day). \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house itself is very organized and very comfortable. my kids love the toys provided by karen as well as the swing and the tree house. we enjoyed our stay in this house.i would like to go back ! really caring host. everything worked fine. we got a lot nice tips and and the contact was always easy. the flat was huge, beautiful and well equipped. the balcony and the hot tub were really a highlight. it\\'s located in a very nice neighborhood.  the area is quite, so you can sleep very well. there are shops and restaurants with delicious food around the corner. i think, it can\\'t be better! thanks for having us. we had an awesome stay!what a spectacular place! charles and ann were great hosts – charles was very responsive to any inquiries we had and welcomed us with a bottle of wine which was thoughtful and unexpected. the house is in a quiet neighborhood, but we were able to walk to nearby shops and restaurants most days. the views from the deck are spectacular — we were treated to several breathtaking sunrises over the bay (until we adjusted to west coast time) and my daughter loved spending time in garden. the house itself is very spacious, comfortable and well appointed. we would happily stay here again.the host is very responsive and provides a great, clean, and modern space for travelers looking for a local, residential sf experience with quick, easy access to public transport to travel to sf\\'s city center and other popular areas. the location is close to some great locations like golden gate park, sf zoo, stern recreation grove, lake merced, and not too far from the ocean. nearby taraval street has a couple neighborhood bars and some good options for food like chinese, japanese, korean, mexican, irish pubs, cafes, safeway, walgreens, pizza, etc. nice location in a quiet neighborhood known for it\\'s sunset views. other travelers during my stay were interesting and from various parts of the world. our host is very welcoming and creates a very comfortable travel experience.it was a really great experience to stay this place. the house was new and was located in so convenient area. a bus stop and a muni station are really close to the house. the hosts are very kind and they always try to take care of us. this house is not only that hosts are so nice, but also that visitors of this  house are so cool guys. i could make lots of friends from vary countries, and they were so friendly. even i sheared a room with 3 other guys, i felt so comfortable to stay this place. if i come back to san francisco, i will definitely stay this place again!was an excellent place to stay, the roommates and hosts were very nice. the home is in a very safe and friendly neighborhood, close to the transit, and tons of places to eat. will definitely book the next time i plan a trip to san francisco.kevin is an amazing host. he was really helpful and attentive during the whole time of our stay. the house itself is much larger than we thought, well equipped, clean and located close to everything we might need. \\r\\n\\r\\nstrongly recommended!positive and friendly. the house was well maintained and in a great location. wonderfull house !!!\\nall was perfect and if i had to live in san francisco i would have a house like that !! the place around is very very nice with a lot of small restaurants and shops.. \\nthe equipment of the house is really complete and of high quality. it\\'s a privileged place and its occupants are and will be lucky :-)\\nplease note there is a lot of stairs to climb up to the housewhat else can i say, this home is amazing!  great location, fantastic views, feels like sf.  thank you so much for making your home available.  looking forward to next time.phillip\\'s home was spectacular. great amenities, beautiful views of the city, and excellent location. would highly recommend this location to friends and family. we had a wonderful experience staying at this home. it was cozy and yet very spacious with the large windows facing the city and glorious views. the deck was lovely and we were even able to catch much of the air show from fleet week just from the deck! that\\'s how great the view is. francis was very responsive and communicated well which also made this a great experience. susette was fantastic and we loved our day at the space in the mission! it was a spacious room with natural light and we enjoyed using the small deck to sit outside. we had such a great time in susette\\'s space. we rented it out for the day for the 17 people who live in sf for my company. it was exactly what we expected and there was a ton of space for us to all spread out and work. they were right next door as well so if we needed anything throughout the day we could ask for help. i would definitely book this space again if we need it!this was a fantastic space as we held our extended management (21 people) offsite here for two days.  the space was airy and comfortable and was large enough for us to have three simultaneous breakout sessions as well as group lectures.\\r\\n\\r\\nsusette was very gracious and helpful in terms of booking and offering to help us book an offsite event next door.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would recommend the space without reservation!i booked susette\\'s space for a workshop for a group of our employees, and per usual, everything went off without a hitch. the space has everything you need to successfully run a meeting - projector, blackout shades, white boards and supplies - and the ambience is great and susette is a wonderful host. highly recommend.suzette and ayla were so accommodating - and extremely responsive.  we could not have asked for a better space for our event as it was a combination of events over three days and they were always available if we needed an extra pot of coffee, the projector set up, an extra fan or even to let someone in for us.  we\\'ll definitely use their space again if the need arises.booked susette\\'s place for another employee workshop and once again had an amazing experience and received a lot of positive feedback from the attendees. highly recommended!susette\\'s space was fantastic...perfect for our team offsite. there were plenty of \"business\" amenities (projector, white boards, great wifi, etc.) and the listing was bright, airy and extremely well kept. the kitchen and bathroom were spotless and convenient for our group of about 10. susette\\'s team was communicative and extremely helpful throughout our entire workshop. i would highly recommend her place and will definitely be booking again in the future!the space was exactly what we were expecting and was a perfect size for our group of 20. susette and her team were super helpful and accommodating to our questions and any needs we had.we held our company retreat at susette\\'s venue for a group of 15 and it was perfect!  we had a large group discussion then broke out into 5 different groups for activities and had plenty of diverse spaces to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nour team loved the outdoor patio and haven\\'t stopped raving about the venue.  susette and ayla were responsive and accommodating.  they even provided whiteboards and easels for us.  close to bart, there\\'s a parking lot around the corner, mission bowl right down stars.  could not have been better.  highly recommend!!fantastic space for group offsite.  suzette and team were extremely helpful as we set up arrangements for the day.  this was the perfect place for our team to have an off-site. the space is beautiful, the neighborhood was great and the communication was quick and seamless. we\\'d love to have another off-site here!we absolutely love using this listing for our team to work! it is a beautiful space that fits all of our needs. not only that, the hosts are so friendly and easy to work with! thank you!the listing was 100% accurate! it is a very warm, modern and creative atmosphere with everything we needed.ayla was very helpful and i always felt like i could reach out to her if needed.  the space was exactly like the pictures and it was perfect for the team offsite i held.  the neighborhood is a bit dodgy but i knew this before hand being from sf.  i had a few people from out of town attend who were thrown off by the location but the loft was absolutely perfect for my small team meeting.susette, ayla, and the whole blackwell files team took excellent care of me and my group. the space is fantastic, flexible, and very well managed. my workshop was a huge success thanks to them and i will definitely be back again in the future. great for tech companies and all workshops from intimate, informal, or formal. thank you susette and team!the space was awesome! exactly as pictured. ayla was great to work with. i will definitely try to book this space again the next time we need to do an offsite meeting.as always, susette and ayla went above and beyond for our stay. we love this space - it is perfect for a quiet working day. we plan to use it again in the future :) space was perfect!  super airy, yet set up to get work done.we use this space regularly and once again it was perfect! ayla and susette are so easy to work with and go above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. susette and her team are lovely.  organized, timely, flexible.  she\\'s done an incredible job making her space design forward, warm and functional.  susette was able to confirm details of the booking in advance and send over a manual for the workspace so that we could reference necessary information such as wifi, cleanup and other faq\\'s. our use of studio 4 at blackwell, inc. was perfect! the description was right on. it was a great intimate setting away from the office equipped with all the tools we needed to have a productive brainstorming session. staff was there to greet us and familiarize us with the space, the patio was nice during breaks and we were able to cater in lunch because of the mini kitchen (birite caters and is right down the street). i highly recommend this space for your next company offsite. \\r\\n\\r\\nit is in an up and coming section of the mission. one attendee felt it was an eyeopening section of town, but he was not familiar with the mission. all in all the attendees raved about the space. the mission bowling club is right next store. we took advantage of this, held a team activity there afterwards and had a blast.  susette was fabulous. very welcoming and easy to work with. the space was gorgeous and easy to get too. we will absolutely come back again! i never met suzette but her assistant, ayla, was fantastic.  communication was friendly, easy and responsive.  they even accommodated my request to check-in early at the last minute!  the venue was perfect for our 15-person work offsite - it was spacious and the refrigerator allowed us to plan ahead of meals.  i\\'d definitely book this listing for an offsite event again.studio 4 is perfect for a group meeting. from the enormous space to the deck in the back, this is must book. the place is huge with a kitchen, lounge area with a couch and a large area with chairs and a projector for presentations. we loved it and will definitely be back. this is by far one of the best spaces to use for a meeting - it is spacious, clean, modern, and the hosts continually go above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable! definitely recommend it for daytime use! the space was perfect for our seminar!  the outdoor space was lovely,  the bathroom and kitchen were well-stocked and clean, and the main space was very stylish.  the space was flexible, with different types of seating and many possible arrangements, making for a perfect venue for a seminar.  the neighborhood had secure parking around the corner, a cafe/coffee shop across the street and bart close by.... super convenient.  our hosts were very friendly, available when we needed them, and kept in great communication leading up to the event.  i\\'d definitely recommend the space and hope to book it again!the overall experience of renting the space was great - communication was quick and straightforward, and suzette and co. were helpful in responding to my various questions in the lead-up to our day at the space.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space does require a certificate of insurance (coi), so that is something to keep in mind before you book. most businesses have this on file, but it is an extra step to be aware of.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space is very sunny, the outdoor patio is fantastic, and it\\'s a great working space no doubts!the space worked out perfectly for our team, was spacious, and had all the tools we needed. check-in process was fast and we\\'ve already booked the space for another offsite meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly complaint is that this space is through a company which requires an additional signed contract and certificate of insurance with them added. this isn\\'t a huge deal but it\\'s not mentioned in the listing, requires a lot of additional back and forth with the host, and adds some steps to the process. although this is normal with larger spaces and i\\'m very familiar with the process, it means having hr get our coi updated by our insurance company and having our legal team review the contract. basically, just causes a lot more steps with a lot more people which becomes time-consuming. this also means they do not automatically forward you check-in info through airbnb. as a result, i was emailing them repeatedly through the weekend trying to find out the check-in info for a monday morning meeting, since that info then needed to be passed onto those attendees.\\r\\n\\r\\ni book airbnbs regularly for our company and this additional leg work took up unanticipated extra time on my end and was annoying but the space itself is great and we\\'ll be back.we booked this space for a company sales engineering offsite and it was great. susette & the blackwell team were very accommodating, and i\\'m sure we\\'ll use the space again in the future for similar events. space was exactly as advertised in the listing - great place for our team offsite!suzette\\'s listing is the perfect space for a working offsite! we love using this open, modern, and conveniently located space any time we have the chance. suzette and her team are super easy to communicate with and make the experience easy and enjoyable. i recently hosted a company offsite in this studio and it was perfect for our group. the mission is a lively place and the location is very close to great restaurants and bars. the studio is open and light. i especially loved the quaint attached patio space to allow folks to get outside and soak in the sun. it was exactly as described and it was a pleasure working with ayla. my client loved the space!  they were looking for something to get their creative juices flowing and it was the perfect spot for them!my company rented this space for an offsite for 10 people. it was a perfect space - light, airy and open but had every amenity that we needed. ayla was great to work with and answered all my questions immediately. i will definitely be using this space for future events.  what a great space! all the amenities needed (projector, kitchen, etc.) plus plenty of room for breakouts and larger workshops. the outdoor space was a great touch!we had an away day here for about 11 people on a friday afternoon. such a beautiful place, the staff were extraordinarily friendly and helpful, and everything we needed and asked for was provided. we would not hesitate to book this place again in the future!space: this is a truly amazing space.  it’s everything you could ask for in a modern studio: modular, spacious, well designed, beautiful, and flexible.  we hosted a group of 20 designers for a two day workshop and it was just big enough to fit everyone, with space to work in groups and space to be together as a circle.  the outdoor patio provided a much needed outlet during our intensive––it’s gorgeous and the perfect way to get outside without leaving the building.  all in all, our team will use this space again for future workshops––it was perfect for just this kind of thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nhosts: the ladies next door were so generous and kind, offering us extra fans for a hot day and folding tables as needed.  they offered us the chance to see the space early, and stay late to clean up.   they are truly wonderful hosts in every respect.\\r\\n\\r\\ntechnical: the wifi is fast.  we brought our own projector and sound system, but the provided gear was also fine, albeit not the latest.  there is great natural light throughout the day, and the overhead lighting is adjustable, which came in handy.  there are plenty of folding chairs beyond the 16 or so orange ones pictured.this is by far our favorite listing to use for our team offsites. not only is the space fully equipped with everything one would need for a full day\\'s work, but suzette and ayla are the absolute best hosts. ayla totally helped us out last minute when our listing was canceled - we cannot thank her enough! love this space for our offsites! we try to use it every chance we can :) great amenities, great communication, overall perfect.great space. perfect for team offsite. we had 7 people, food catered in, good supplies and great ambience overall. will definitely book again.

used this space many times for team offsite meetings. the space works out perfectly and we love that it\\'s flexible. susette is always easy to work with and responsive.the space was great for our team work session. we had access to whiteboards and a projector. ayla was very responsive to questions. i would recommend the space.we chose this space for our design workshop as some of us had attended a training offsite in the same space two months ago and kept it in mind for our own events. the space has great flow and offers a flexible layout. after a warm greeting and simple check in our team moved in for the day and immediately felt at home. the location is easy to get to via public transit and there is a machine pay parking lot just steps away. our host informed us beforehand that there may be a problem with the internet the day of our workshop and provided us with alternatives to choose from, but she phoned back quickly with a resolution and we were well-connected throughout the day. they supply a projector that works, but we\\'ll bring our own projector next time for higher resolution output. we hope to return, it\\'s a bright space, great for team activities and ideation.our various teams have used this space countless times now for offsite meetings. everyone loves the space and susette is great to work with. she is always flexible and does her best to get us the days and times we need. great space for a creative workshop!  this was an amazing space. it fit our group perfectly and had everything we needed. susette was an amazing host, was there to

little warmer so we could have enjoyed the outdoor deck! we had an amazing event in this great space!place was great. second time here for a team offsite and planning session. would come back again

fully equipped and on top of that very helpful staff in the office.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are looking forward to renting again.\\r\\n\\r\\nsuzette and ayla were amazing in responsiveness and helpfulness with

clean and the house was just beautiful.  julie made some great dinner suggestions and her knowledge of the area was a big plus.  we will definitely be back to visit her in the future!incredible! i come to san francisco for 13+ years now and usually stay at union square\\'s hilton, marriott, the palace, etc. this was my very first experience with airbnb and the communication with saundra in preparation for the reservation was already half the fun. staying at saundra\\'s marvelous place and ben\\'s warm welcome will make it easy to choose my preferred place to stay when i am in town again. i’ll be back. many thanks, saundra! i spent with my wife and three kids 4 days at saundra\\'s place and we really enjoyed it. her home is very nice, well furbished and located in a great neighborhood. everything was well organized before we arrived, saundra is a great hostess. i definitely recommend it and look forward to coming back.staying at saundra\\'s beautiful place is the real san francisco  experience!!!  saundra has been great in responding to my concerns regardless of the fact that she\\'s out of town!  two thumbs up!!!we know sf quite well but were thrilled to get to know a new neighborhood and enjoy the gracious and comfortable \"elegant mediterranean garden home\".  transportation downtown is a cinch, neighborhood markets and a farmer\\'s market are right down the street, and it is an easy walk to the mission or golden gate park.  everything was just right with this home -- and the hosts are wonderful and helpful in every way --- there wasn\\'t even any sf fog and we were guests in late june! sundra was a wonderful hostess, and her house is amazing.  the location is the castro district and is close to great restaurants.  the garage parking was a real asset.  the house was bright, clean, and filled with beautiful artworks!  my favorite part was the amazing garden!!  we sat out there in perfect weather enjoying the many flowers and hummingbirds!!  i was glad to see and hear a variety of birds in sf!  there was plenty of room for six..overall a true san francisco experience!!a lovely house in a great area, everything was ready for us and was like a home from home. thanks so much saundra - you are a super host!!)saundra\\'s home exudes the warmth you would want in your own home - if you were a talented artist, and knew how to design spaces for groups, individuals, and families to reconnect and rejuvenate.  from the large dining room where we played games, to the back patio that was like a slice of heaven, to the living room with the warm views and sounds of the city, we all found ways to truly enjoy the time together.  her selection of cd\\'s is amazing and will provide a great soundtrack for your visit. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe kitchen easily holds big groups for family cooking and is well equipped with everything you will want.  the bedrooms upstairs are luxurious, and even the couple who shared twin trundle beds had a sitting area for them to enjoy the light of outdoors while still inside. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe will all be back soon. fabulous fabulous fabulous - we actually stayed here last summer and have been a bit slow to review but this was an amazing and memorable holiday to san francisco - made even better by staying in saundra\\'s wonderful house.  she was waiting for us when we arrived and was very welcoming - she gave us lots of inside local tips on where to eat and what to visit in the area. great area, super easy to get around on the trams & buses to downtown, shopping and major tourist sights.  we did a lot of walking & this was a perfect house to return to after a big day out.  can\\'t recommend this highly enough - you will love this house & saundra!we had a wonderful experience with saundra. the house is beautiful and in an ideal location. saundra made the whole process of check-in and check-out very simple and convenient. we are looking forward to coming back to her house. our stay in castro street was awesome! it started with saundra\\'s warm welcome to california. the house is quintessential san francisco. the reception rooms are finely decorated and very spacious. the dining room and fabulous kitchen leading out into the glorious garden, were a real bonus as we did entertain guests some evenings during our stay. the grandparents in our group were well able to manage the steps as all along there were secure handrails for them to use. the bedrooms were light and airy. the beds so comfortable that jet lag was easily overcome. the garage space was a huge asset together with the convenient location. although we had rented a car, the younger members of our group used public transport and had no problem getting around. every conceivable extra is at your fingertips, from the laundry facilities to the excellent sound system. saundra is an extremely generous host and it was our pleasure to enjoy her beautiful home.saundra\\'s house is amazing. i stayed there with my mom and my two sisters for 5 days and we had a great time! the house is full of wonderful art and cozy areas for lounging. the bathtub is a dream! the house is located in an unbeatable (and very safe) area. minutes from all the great areas you want to visit and muni transportation is just around the corner. lots of great restaurants within walking distance and the local grocery store on the corner has everything you need. saundra made us feel at home in her beautiful house and we enjoyed cooking in her great kitchen and enjoyed our coffee (and wine!) in the garden. staying at saundra\\'s made our trip to the wonderful city of san francisco that much more enjoyable. highly recommended. saundra\\'s home was the perfect fit for our 10 day san francisco adventure. the house is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. the house is so much larger than it seems in the photos, and there is lots of original artwork everywhere. the garden is lovely, and even had a small lettuce patch! the house has a great location making it easy access to both haight ashbury and the castro. it\\'s also quite convenient to bi-rite grocery stores, it\\'s even walkable, which was a real treat, for me, the gourmet food lover. saundra is a gracious hostess and made us very comfortable. she had all the little details already in place and made our stay effortless. the kitchen is a cook\\'s dream and it was a pleasure to cook in it. we would be thrilled to stay at her home again and can highly recommend it to you.the reservation was canceled 22 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we are a family of 5 and all loved our stay at saundra\\'s house! the home is well appointed, inviting, stylish, and comfortable. we enjoyed the serene garden and wonderful art work through out the house. saundra was a terrific hostess! she openly shared her insight of the city and had available to us many books on san francisco, california plus, restaurant listings and brochures of popular sights. we hope to visit and stay there again!i don\\'t have any more superlatives to add to the other sparkling reviews, except to say that mere words are inadequate to describe the comfort, location, and luxury of this house.  every detail is as described in the listing and more so.  the garden is a joy as well as the living spaces and the kitchen.  if you want to feel that you instantly live in san francisco this is the place for you and your family.  saundra is a gracious guide and host who will assist you with any questions, although the house and location speak for themselves.  you will love staying in this listing!!!great house close to a muni stop direct to downtown. saundra was an excellent host. the house is beautiful and she wants you to make it your own. i stayed here with two work colleagues and made full use of the facilities hosting a dinner and often used her guides on places where to eat out. i will definitely be back and would not hesitate in recommending. saundra was a fantastic host!!! from the minute we arrived she went out of her way to help and she gave us lots of useful advice and information on san fran.  the house was fantastic, lovely bedrooms upstairs and downstairs was great for us as our toddler had plenty of space to run around! the kitchen has everything you could possibly need and more. the location was great, only a short walk to the local shops and train station. we would not hesitate in recommending saundra or her house! thanks again!we had a great family stay at saundra\\'s house. we were made to feel at home from the moment we arrived. we were provided with basic provisions and toiletries which settled us in from the start. the house operating manual and details on the local area were perfect. we could operate everything and we visited places we would have taken weeks to find on our own. the house is comfortably furnished with a variety of different spaces to sit in and relax. the kitchen is well equipped. the location couldn\\'t have been better. it\\'s easy to get downtown but also in a vibrant neighbourhood with lots of small stores a restaurants. we immediately felt like locals!we had a wonderful stay at saundra\\'s beautiful house. the place is spacious and has plenty of room and restrooms for a family of 5. the kitchen is very well equipped and the garden is just lovely. the house is so beautiful that it might tempt you to stay home instead of travelling around sf. saundra\\'s welcome was great. she gave us plenty of advice about the city and its surroundings. basic provisions awaited us so didn’t have to rush out for supplies. the house is perfectly located to get to know the city and very close to public transportation, restaurants and shops.  thanks for everythingsaundra was a great host and very easy to communicate with. the house was great and just as described in the posting. we had a great week at saundra\\'s beautiful and spacious town house, which exceeded our expectations and a real haven from the bustling city around! it was a good base for exploring the city as well as escaping for day trips north and south. saundra was welcoming, always available to help and with the utmost respect for our privacy. thank you!fantastic apartment as advertised!  be sure to spend time in the backyard garden.  easy walking access to surrounding neighborhoods.  working with saundra was a pleasure, and we appreciated the snacks she provided for us given our very late arrival.  would definitely stay here again.the place is amazing! it\\'s in a very nice neighborhood in upper castro, and the place is spacious. saundra is very accommodating and responsive. we had an amazing stay!lawrence and his family were great hosts. the apartment was in a great location, had lots of rooming options and was set up with lots of little touches that made a difference like snacks, towels, soap and shampoo. would gladly stay with lawrence again.lawrence was kind and welcoming. he very generously met us for a late night check in and was understanding when we ran late at check out. the space is plain,  simple,  clean and comfortable...not to mention spacious. the neighborhood is quiet and inviting, so close to the park and the public transit system. highly recommend this host and am an air bnb regular! lawrence made us feel welcomed. house was just as he listed. answered all text and emails in a timely manner. lawrence communicated very promptly and was flexible to meet our last minute travel plans.  his home is very spacious and met most our needs. there is a garage for a single car, although no remote to use.  the location was perfect for us and great for utilizing public transportation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nbus 26 south is 4 blocks and takes you to the 16th avenue tiled steps (beautiful views!)\\r\\nbus 26 north is 6 blocks and takes you to the golden gate bridge and the wharf.  \\r\\nbus 5 is 4 blocks and takes you west to the beach and east into town.   the space was perfect for our group of four friends. everyone was able to have their own bedroom with plenty of separation, and there were multiple doors to block out noise between the common spaces and each room.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe flat was clean, airy, light, and well appointed.  lawrence even had a selection of snacks available to purchase if you don\\'t feel like trekking to the convenience store. i\\'d definitely recommend this place if you\\'re staying in san francisco.location is very convenient, the landlord has prepared a lot of snacks in the room, of course not free, but it\\'s very convenient.the house is fantastic for our group cause it\\'s big enough for our 6. the flat is spacious,light and clean. what\\'s more, it has a big garage so we can place our car in it.\\r\\nlawrence is very kind to us. he provided anything we may need and sent us a box of chocolate&candies before we left. he can speak mandarin so it\\'s a good choice for travellers from china.\\r\\nmy family stayed here for a weekend. it was spacious and the location was great. you can do morning runs to the park and lots of good chinese and korean food around this neighborhood. host was very accommodating as well. lawrence is very nice and made us feel at home.  the neighborhood is quiet and safe.great neighborhood.  interesting house with lots of rooms.  lawerence called the night we got in to make sure we got in without a problem.  it was nice to have a place to park our car being that parking is hard to find in the are. it was my family really enjoyed their stay. the house is really lovely and clean. we had several people in san francisco for a family event, and lawrence\\'s home provided more than enough space for all of us to stay together.  the home was clean and very quiet. being able to park one car in the garage was huge bonus. great place to crash at night after exploring the city all day. my family stayed here for a weekend and lawrence was very friendly and very accommodating. the house was nice, clean and fit my family of 6 very comfortably. i was also great to have your own parking space in the garage as trying to park in sf is rather difficult. lawrence also provides snacks at a fee and little touches like towels and shampoo that make it easy and convenient. we had a little problem with the garage door not working but lawrence came quickly (within 10 min) to fix it. also there was only one bathroom mirror so if you have alot of people(girls) staying with you, bring your own mirror ;) the apartment is clean and nice. the internet is so fast and it has a parking garage which is a huge plus. on the other side, the school near by can make it little noisy in the morning. also, the curtains are transparent which makes the room bright in the morning. overall, we had good time specially that leave every day around 10am and only come back at night to sleep.the apartment was very clean and very spacious!  location is exactly where you want to be.  we had 8 people staying and there was more than enough space.  \\n\\nthe only issue is with only 1 full restroom available, it might take awhile for everyone to shower in the morning.  but besides that, everything was as advertised, and would recommend the space to any other large groups (as long as everyone takes quick showers!)\\n\\nalso, it might be a good idea if one or two full length mirrors were available in one or two of the bedrooms.  thanks so much, lawrence!everything was perfect, lawrence was a cool hosthost was very attentive and helpful. accommodations were perfect for a large group. a great value and met all of our expectations and then some.we had a wonderful time at lawrence\\'s! the place is conveniently located for those wants to visit all parts of sf. one of the best parts for us was the parking garage. we had a mini van hauling four adults, one toddler and many suits cases. it would have been a lot of trouble if we had to look for a street parking every time we returned from an outing. the place is clean, spacious and comforting. it instantly made us feel at home. the amenities are as advertised; we loved his new washer and dryer:) lawrence was kind and accommodating; he allowed our last minute request to add a few more guests. this place is ideal for a large family get away!lawrence was incredibly organized and diligent! he got back to me promptly every time i had a question.  he even bought me a pack n play prior to my arrival for my baby. good place to stay with kids, lots of room. lawrence made our stay easy and enjoyable.our stay in san francisco was amazing - a huge part of it is due to the wondeful home dan was kind enough to share with us. the architectural design and careful thought that he put in making sure all the details come

in the city.amazing place. fantastic location. house is extremely well laid out and designed in every detail. very modern and full of beautiful little touches. the view is breathtaking down to san

bonus when you\\'re arriving 0100 in the morning.fantastic spot! we enjoyed our stay here - thanks so much.the place is just as described and the location is exactly what we were looking for. the

againthe host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.dan was a wonderful host, yet again! \\r\\nhe is very quick to respond to questions and he was super helpful when we decided to extend the stay with 1 night (which turned out to be quite complicated).the house is beautiful and the views are stunning.\\ni was there for 10 days and it felt like home.\\nthank you for hosting me and my co workers.i was in san francisco for work and was looking for a listing that could accommodate myself and 2 colleagues. luckily, i found dan\\'s beautiful home. his place was even better in person and was perfect for our stay. we each had our own room and plenty of space (very important when you\\'re coming back from a day of work). \\r\\n\\r\\nchecking in was easy and the place was ready for us upon our arrival. it was just as pictured and that view is unbeatable. dan was also very responsive and got back to me quickly if i had any questions. definitely plan to book again. dan has a great spot, a lovely home with bags of character and a view to match. dan was great with communications, and generally hosted us incredibly well. looking forward to staying again. dan was an excellent and communicative host! everything was set up for us ahead of time, and dan was readily available to answer our questions. my group included a couple folks who had never been to sf and they felt very welcomed! the space was lovely and we would absolutely stay here again.the house was amazing and looks exactly like the pictures. dan made it very easy when we arrived to san francisco and left recommendation for the area.  it\\'s in a really good area and you can walk to restaurants and shops. we loved it. totally recommend it.definitely the best place i\\'ve ever stayed insf!! dan got everything well prepared before we arrive, we had a good time resting and chillin out in the house and making our own breakfast every morning in this gorgeous kitchen. highly recommend this place and will def come back again! :)the reservation was canceled 22 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we had a fantastic time at georges place, what a great location & pad he has! a real gem of a place…….we are so glad we found it! \\r\\nwe enjoyed throughly his beautiful 3 bedroom home; it\\'s ascetically decorated, comfortable, clean & tidy and very welcoming. not to mention his exceptional unobstructed view of the pacific ocean is only right there….i mean right in-front of you/  the pictures are more than accurate….. the sunsets are amazing!  it was bliss to wake in the mornings to the sun rising, people jogging walking riding to bring a peaceful feel to the mornings to the dream sunsets casing a magnetic ray of light through the whole house- it was magical. \\r\\nouter sunset district it a special part of sf- if you haven\\'t ventured this far west of san fran- you need to! this district moves to a different beat of a drum with a really cool vib of laid-backness- we\\'ve really come to love it & enjoy it since our son has resided there. \\r\\nwe were looking for that special something where we could celebrate our son\\'s graduation from sfsu as well as enjoy our time away, as we too run a small operation that keeps us super busy…. we most certainly found it here. the outer sunset is the last frontier to a small town feel and yet quick, easy access to downtown sf/ maybe 40 mins straight run on the tram. the muni/tram/bus is just around the corner that you can jump on which will take you to all the hot spots you want & need to see in sf;  for sf is one of those special cities in the world you need to explore. everything was within walking distance; ie exceptional organic food & produce store where you can stock up with all your needs , devils teeth coffee is a great hang-out in the mornings, unique little small restaurants to the big beach chalet  to a variety in-between - you\\'ve got it all there within walking or short drive…..and of-course golden gate park, sutro baths & the sf zoo at opposite poles to explore. \\r\\ngeorge is only a call/text away if you need him for anything- he\\'s super responsive, caring & hospitable that will do all he can to make your stay most comfortable. \\r\\nit was a very special time in our lives for we only have one son and we wanted to go all out with celebrating his graduation and georges place & location made it that. \\r\\ncome enjoy & you will see too…..thank you for opening your home to us george we will forever have great memories xxx george has an amazing place and all the reviews below tell the story quite well.  we look forward to another opportunity to visit the bay and hopefully stay at this hidden gem.  thanks george!  --james & family.our stay in george\\'s place was really nice, we had an amazing time in his house. we really enjoyed all the decoration and the equipements and above all the fantastic view on the pacific ocean. george was really helpfull when we needed him. \\r\\nwhat else to say, we recommend this house to all people (familly or friends) who plan to come to san francisco. the neighborhood is quiet and beautiful and it\\'s very pleasant to take a run along the ocean.great spot in a beautiful location.  george\\'s home is steps from the beach and a short walk to golden gate park. lots of space, and perfectly sleeps 3 with room for more.  a friend and i were looking for a convenient location to stay at for outside lands and it didn\\'t disappoint. if in the bay area again we\\'d definitely stay again. nice and convent place\\ndefinitely will stay again\\ngeorge\\'s home by the ocean can be described by one word - \" amazing!!!\" we were a party of 6 with 3 adults and 3 teens, the home provided everything we needed plus more. the view of ocean beach was so peaceful and stunning. we all enjoyed having breakfast by the dining table since it had a huge window so we could watch the action taking place outside. the amenities of the home were more than adequate for us and the beds were all great. the weather and the comfy beds provided us with great sleep, which made the vacation truly relaxing. if you travel often you know what i mean when it takes several nights to get comfortable. we had to force ourselves to leave the home since it felt so comfortable there. we spent our mornings just people watching since there were a lot of surfers, joggers and neighbors out and about. parking was easy since there were plenty of spots available. so in short if you want scenery, comfy home and peace of mind then this is the home to book. george is also extremely easy to deal with and always available to help with anything you need. he truly made us feel like it was our home during the stay there. the kids loved the house and have already asked to come back there again. we loved it so much that on sunday we actually went to several open houses in the neighborhood to check out the possibility of getting a home for ourselves. \\nthanks george for letting us use your amazing home and being such a gracious host. \\n\\nthis property was excellent value for our stay in san francisco with well equipped, comfortable accommodation for four adults.  there was plenty of parking outside the property and we found the sights of san francisco easily accessible for visiting returning to a quiet and peaceful area for the night.  the ocean was right on the doorstep and it was interesting watching the early morning surfers, joggers and walkers from the balcony whilst drinking coffee.  our only regret was missing seeing any of the sunsets not because of the weather but because we were out every evening we stayed enjoying downtown san francisco. a bonus was the excellent weather which we weren\\'t expecting having learned of fogs and cold spells during our research.  once we had found this property through airbnb the inquiry process and subsequent booking was very easy and straightforward and george kept in contact with us and answered our queries, checking our arrival arrangements during the day of our arrival.  all instructions and house rules were clearly articulated making expectations easy all round.  we would recommend this property for anyone who likes peace and quiet, comfortable surroundings  away from a city centre and hotels.it\\'s a really great place to stay, right in front of the ocean. i will definitely recommend it.georg, your surf shack is great! we had a georgeous time in sf and a lot of fun. the outlook to the pacific is outstanding, the location is easy to find, no matter from where you are comin. the communication was easy and uncomplicated. \\r\\njust perfect.great place to stay - the location was phenomenal for us and really the biggest selling point. the place is good - the living area is fantastic.\\r\\n\\r\\ngeorge was a great host - really great communication and some good recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly things to point out would be that the garage is really, really tight. but on-street parking is easy. the only other minor hassle was stripping all the beds and putting on a wash before we left - was tough because we had to get to a very early flight and have a toddler!\\r\\n\\r\\noverall i would absolutely recommend this place.great place- clean, well decorated, and convenient. the beds were incredibly comfortable. there is plenty of parking on the road and its literally around the corner from the muni stop for the #71 or a short walk from the n. both of these can take you into some great areas of the city. george was a great host- very responsive on email or messages.  i will be definitely staying again. this beautiful home is everything advertised and more.  our family had a wonderful time in a great location.  the ocean view and access is fantastic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nwalking to neighborhood restaurants/shops, public transportation, and ease of parking are nice features of the location.\\r\\n\\r\\nand of course, the home was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for a working family on vacation including internet, cable tv, and a nice area to relax.  \\r\\n\\r\\ngeorge was a great host and was very responsive to all of our needs.  thank you george and we would definitely stay at the beautiful home again.  the place was perfect. we came with as a family of 5 + our baby sitter. room was plentiful and there was an office that i could sneak use when i needed some quiet time for work. parking was plentiful and being right across from the ocean was very special. we were originally concerned about being outside the big scene of downtown sf, but the proximity to the beach totally made up for it. next time we visit we would stay at georges again. nice quite location. great views! george was very helpful. thank you!! :)my family and i loved this place.  it was clean, comfortable and hosts a lovely view of an often forgotten part of the city: the beach!  it was the perfect place to mellow out with the ones you love.  the rooms are all attached and there is only one bathroom, which adds to its beach-cabinesque appeal.  had a lovely stay, would definitely recommend the surge shack!we, a family of 5 from the netherlands stayed in george\\'s house for a week. we enjoyed the house and the location. it is a relatively quiet environment, especially at night.the ocean view is as beautiful as promised.\\r\\nvisiting sf downtown is very easy, traveling the region also.\\r\\nwe can recommend you to rent the house while visiting this part of california, and when we plan to visit to sf again we would certainly choose for this house again.another great stay- this time with kids. we loved the house, proximity to the beach, and easy access to the city. would recommend anyone to stay here- couples alone or families. george was very responsive and checked in with us frequently to ensure we had everything we needed.   the house was clean and very comfortable.  although it is a bit remote from downtown, we never waited more than 10 minutes for an uber ride.the reservation was canceled 33 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.george\\'s house was nice, clean and everything we wanted for our stay in san francisco. the view is fantastic. i would definitely stay there again!the reservation was canceled 33 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.george was a fabulous host with quick responses to my inquiries.  the vacation home was very beautiful in the perfect setting with everything we needed.  i would definitely rent this home again!!!  thanks for a great vacation!george\\'s place was perfect for my family. we were 5 and had plenty of space. the ocean view was amazing and walks nearby were breathtaking. it\\'s was the perfect home away from home for us! check in and out were easy as well. i would highly recommend it if you are looking for a relaxing get away to an amazing city!indeed an amazing house! we had a fantastic week. the place was spotless clean, had great view of the beach, was in close proximity of the airport (about 20 minutes), and also has good access to the city center. nice bonus was free parking. we liked the recommendations for restaurants in the area. breakfast at devil\\'s teeth is indeed highly recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\ngeorge responded very quickly to our questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!we had a great time at the beachfront house. the view from the balcony was amazing. plenty of room for our family. our host was great to work with and the house was very clean. we loved it!george\\'s house was very clean and cozy. it was perfect for our group of five. the area is nice and quiet, even though the road is close. it\\'s mainly easy going joggers, surfers and dog walkers on the streets :) the beach is great for jogging and the balcony has a beautiful view to the sea. even though the ocean beach area is bit further away from the centre, there are some nice cafe\\'s and a good grocery store nearby, plus the tram stop is close.we just completed our second stay at george\\'s wonderful home and already to plan our third trip.  \\n\\nthe home has everything you need and it truly is oceanfront in a great neighborhood. you receive the true sf experience. m\\n\\nfinally, george was very responsive and helpful for any of your needs. \\n\\nwe will be back. amazing views and location, house was very nice, but two of the bedrooms share the same entrance, meaning you have to enter one bedroom to get to the other. overall a+!great house with beautiful beach view -- perfect for our family of 7 including 2 kids.  the new-ish downstairs master suite was a great option for my elderly parents, as they had some privacy/quiet space to themselves.  as some others have mentioned, one of the bedrooms is only accessible by going through another bedroom - just something to be aware of.  also,  we would suggest that a few more plates / glasses / cutlery be provided, as the amount there was not quite enough for a 4br place.  george was easy to deal with, house was ready for an early check-in, and the house was otherwise well equipped with all necessities (bedding, towels, soap/shampoo, basic kitchen items, laundry detergent etc.).  we thoroughly enjoyed our week!george\\'s home has fantastic views, and is very comfortable.  the kitchen is definitely upscale and worked well for us as we love to cook.  the location is great, we enjoyed many walks on the beach and liked that parking was so easy.  the pictures of the home are accurate and the home enjoyable.  george did come by a couple times to get surfboards and water the plants, but notified us before he arrived.  he was definitely a gracious host and i would recommend him in the future.at the 11th hour i booked this amazing beachfront house in san francisco may 13-17th.  would i do it again....you bet.  george was more than accommodating.  his house was immaculate with everything needed except food and my wine for our adventure.  very homey, easily accessible, parking was great and the master suite was my home away from home.  the thing that impressed me the most was george texted me to make sure i got settled, asked if i needed anything and left me several numbers in case i needed him.  who does that??  yes george i want to come back and i will tell my friends about you.  the location was fabulous. the house was extremely neat, clean and comfortable. parking was very easy and the neighborhood offered everything we could\\'ve wanted in terms of restaurants, markets and coffee shops. the only regret that i have is that i was too busy working to fully enjoy the stay. thanks very much, george!my friends and i had a great time.  the house was clean and beautiful, there were plenty of games, towels, and other supplies.  the view was beautiful.  it could not have been a better experience.  we were a little late in getting out, and george was kind enough to give us some flexibility on that.  all told, this was a fantastic trip.took my family there who were visiting from overseas and was appalled by the service provided. for the daily rate - to have to strip the bed, unpack a clean dishwasher right before your departure, and take the rubbish out is disgraceful. mostly because a hefty cleaning fee is charged, most cleaners i know fulfill these duties.\\nthe to-do manual was a list of chores and threats if they are not fulfilled... and there was hardly any soap left upstairs. beautiful house, shocking service. we have stayed at tons of air b&b\\'s and i would never stay at this house again, nor recommend it to anyone.all i can say about george, the host, is \"fantastic\"!  after finding out that our original accommodations had cancelled our reservation at the last minute, i booked george\\'s incredible beach front property.  george responded within 15 minutes after i sent my email request, and had us ready to check in by 3pm that same day!!!!  my team and i could not have been happier with the accommodation, location, and most of all, the service george offered... i would absolutely recommend his place, and we are hoping to book with george again for next year\\'s event!  you\\'ve truly earned our business george, and we are grateful for accommodating us during our stay!  thank you again.  best regards, the pebblekick teamamazing location and wonderful house.  suited our needs perfectly!  thank you george.this was a great location to stay at. super clean and the hosts were great to talk to! my friend and i would definitely stay here againdavid and laura were great hosts - friendly, very welcoming to their lovely, clean, modern apartment.  it\\'s situated in a great location in, close to bus routes and loads of great restaurants and bars just down folsom.  will definitely look to stay here again in future!laura and david could not have been better hosts; they were unbelievably cool, accommodating, and helpful in informing us about the city. plus their place is big and beautiful, and their neighborhood is up and coming with the best thai food i\\'ve had in a while! the train\\'s a little bit of a walk so i recommend you walk up folsom street instead of 7th but their place is very centrally located and nothing was ever more than a 10 minute cab/uber ride away. highly recommended!  laura was a great host! the place is great and everything is updated and new.  the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. i would stay here again for sure!!laura and david were great to stay with! they gave us all the info we needed about the area and their place, had good suggestions about what to do in sf, and were very friendly- we felt very much at home. the place itself is in a convenient location, and the common areas were great to spend some evenings relaxing and cooking in when we needed a break. thank you!!i had a great stay at laura and david\\'s apt. location is easy to reach and walking distance from transports, room and private bath are new and very clean. \\nlaura and david are pleasant hosts and down to earth people, i enjoyed my staying and i would recommend them to anyone.great hosts and great place to stay!\\r\\nthe apartament is very close to down town, clean, quiet and comfortable, the room and the private bathroom are up to date and well furnished. better than an average hotel, here you can have an elevate privacy level and all the comfort of an home.\\r\\nlaura and david are a nice young couple, both easy going, very accomodating and willing to help.staying with laura and david was a fantastic experience! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is beautiful, with modern wood flooring and lots of natural lighting, and impeccably clean everywhere. the bedroom we stayed in was roomy, well-lit, and spotless-- the sheets, pillowcases, duvet cover, towels were freshly laundered, all the surfaces were dust-free. the bed was incredibly comfortable; comparable with four-star hotels. the bathroom was spotless, all surfaces gleaming, and toiletries (new toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, etc etc) were thoughtfully provided. \\r\\n\\r\\nlaura and david are also a kind, friendly, worldly couple who are enjoyable to be around, and fun to talk to. i would recommend this place to all of my friends, and if i\\'m ever back in san francisco, i will definitely stay here again. laura and david have a nice, clean, spacious apartment.  i really enjoyed having a full private bathroom right next to the room where i slept, and i appreciated the speedy wi-fi these tech-savvy hosts made available.  i was also favorably impressed with how quiet the neighborhood and apartment were -- a few times i felt like i had the whole building to myself! i happened to fall ill while i was there, and laura and david were very gracious about it, kindly leaving me some cough drops before they left for a weekend trip.  the apartment is in an up-and-coming neighborhood, with myriad nearby restaurant choices and within walking distance or short bus ride to market street and the caltrain station.  laura and david were extremely helpful and friendly. they kept their home very clean and tidy and were able to help anyone coming to the area. their location is close to soma, so if you have any work in the area with a tech company, their location is perfect. i highly recommend staying with themi have been on a business trip in san francisco and stayed at laura´s and david´s place. it is perfectly located if you want to get around in san francisco and the bay area. the flat is really nice, leaves enough space to have some time on your own, but gives you also the possibility to have a chat with laura and david. both of them are really helpful with question and good to have a chat with. i even learned how good cold brewed coffee can taste. i can highly recommend to stay here and i am looking fwd to check in again. laura and david are a laid back and fun young couple and i really enjoyed staying with them and hanging out in the evening. they were truly wonderful hosts and i hope to stay with them again in the future. their space was very clean and spacious and the bedroom was extremely comfortable. having our own private bathroom was very convenient and a big plus. the interior of the apartment is very modern and looked like it had recently been renovated. the appliances and fixtures looked brand new. the location is very conveniently located close to a shopping center and many other shops, restaurants, co-working spaces, bart, etc.perfect place to stay in! the room is clean and large enough for a pair. plus, you get your own bathroom. i found everything well-organized. the hosts are very accommodating and communicative. highly recommended.laura and david had a wonderful, clean home. throughout my stay they were gracious hosts. great location for my stay in san francisco. great apartment, super nice hosts, and an incredibly cute and friendly puppy.i loved staying at laura and david\\'s place.  it was super clean, very modern, had a nice updated private bath and a very nice kitchen .  laura and david were super easy to coordinate with and went the extra mile to make sure my stay was great.  i only wish i had more time to be there as i ended up usually working too late and leaving too early.the reservation was canceled 49 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we loved staying with david and laura! not only are they wonderfully friendly and helpful people, but they are so thoughtful and accommodating, too. it felt like we were staying with friends who we\\'d never met before! big puppy chelsea is adorable and well behaved :) the room is very

arrived it felt like home, everything is there for you to use, and if you think you need something (which is very unlikely because they are always ahead of you and they have thought in everything!) they will be there to help you, which is always a plus.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is just perfect in every aspect, and 5\\' minutes walk from every place you could think of.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally, you will fall in love with chelsea :)laura and david are such a nice couple. they took care about everything and were really friendly. the apartment is huge and exactly like on the pictures. the bed was comfortable and big enough for two. we really recommend staying there. thankslaura and david were great hosts! they were very accommodating and helpful during our stay - being able to meet us at 1am when we finally arrived as well as ordering us a cab when uber wasn\\'t working for us. all the amenities were provided to us in the room when we first arrived and maps of the city were provided. the apartment is within walking distance to almost everything and looks exactly as seen in the pictures. market st. was a short walk away and folsom st has some amazing restaurants. i would recommend staying away from 6th st at night as many other reviews have stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nmany thanks to laura and david for making our stay in sf a great one!\\r\\nwe would love to stay here again!david and

would have everything we needed. we were very happy with the place and would love to stay here again.laura and david were wonderful hosts: friendly, attentive, and accommodating. their place was

next time i\\'m in san francisco.laura and david were great. everything was prepared, organized and ready for my stay. they provided very thoughtful extras like a city guide to use as well as extra

and would have no hesitation in recommending kelsoma. great location and super nice apartment. would definitely stay again!hands down the best airbnb experience we\\'ve had. our company flies out a handful of our teammates every month so we have had much experience with booking weeklong rentals. alex was friendly, prompt and communicative; anticipating needs and taking care of every one of them. his personal touches to make sure the stay was nice was very sweet. and his house - absolutely gorgeous. well appointed and well maintained, beautiful location and view. a lot of love went into this house and it shows. would stay here again in a heartbeat. we had a fantastic time in san francisco!  and our accommodations were terrific.  it was so nice to stay in a place that felt like our \"home\" away from home.  we would come back from a day of sightseeing and relax with a movie or in the hot tub.  our kids loved the place too.alex\\'s house is a gem! wonderfully appointed, great location, gorgeous views; the house is stylishly designed and immaculate, and filled with thoughtful touches. we were there for a family vacation, with three generations under one roof, and all six of us felt at home, from the 5 year old to the 72 year old. this was our first airbnb experience, and i fear alex has spoiled us. i only hope we\\'ll be able to come back to sf and stay in his lovely home again very soon!already the cordial and easy communication with alex prior to our arrival was promising and alex helped us with an early arrival. but our high expectations were even exceeded. our three kids (6, 13, 16) almost \"freaked out\" when we stepped in the house, not only because of having internet tv on a widescreen beamer and a hot tub. (ok, they lived for 3 weeks in a rv and were a little bit weaned from any convenience). but let´s check the facts beyond the first emotions: the house is perfect for up to 6 people with comfortable beds for everyone. it is very well equipped and was super clean and tidy. from the main room and the balcony you have a great view on the hills of castro, on the twin peaks and on downtown sf. in short walking distance there are 2 bus stops (e.g. line 24 taking you north towards castro), cozy restaurants and small shops. alex prepared not only a helpful map of the neighborhood on his blackboard, but also a perfect guide to the house and - not to forget - a warm welcome message, a fruit bowl and a welcome drink. all in all we really felt at home in alex house and for sure we will come back. btw it was our first booking with airbnb - it couldn´t have been better! this was the perfect end to an amazing holiday. alex has the most beautiful home and made us feel so welcome. the beds were incredibly comfy and the view was absolutely stunning. we went to several of alex\\'s restaurant recommendations nearby and they all blew us away. would stay here again in a heartbeat!\\r\\nwe had a wonderful stay at alex\\'s house.  the accomodations are unbeatable and the deck and its view of the noe valley are as well.  the neighborhood is very agreeable with its small shops and restaurants within walking distance. alex\\'s indications prior to our arrival as well as how everything is pointed out within the house made our experience much easier and enjoyable. in summary, we couldn\\'t ask for more.alex was the most accommodating host.  alex was prompt with his responses from the beginning and always used kind words.  the house was so beautiful and the location was ideal.  the house had a very comfortable and home feeling throughout but still felt modern and chic.  there are a lot of details throughout the home that lets you know there was a lot of care and quality put into the home.  alex left several pamphlets to answer any questions about the home and neighborhood. he answered all of our questions before we knew we had questions.  he was so kind that he even gave us a card and a gift to enjoy the last night.  i highly recommend this stylish noe valley home and the neighborhood was just spectacular.  i will be very surprised if any other host could top the kindness and consideration alex exuded.  thank you alex for a perfect vacation!alex\\'s house is gorgeous and he was incredibly sweet and helpful. my family stayed in his home recently while visiting me in sf and they all loved the place. my dad has back problems and alex took the time to show me the house before i booked it so i could ensure it\\'s suitability. he also continued to communicate leading up to our rental period to see if there was anything he could do to help prepare. furthermore, alex had fruit, champagne, coffee and even a welcome card awaiting my families arrival! his house is clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. the views from the decks are fantastic too. parking was easy as you can park in front of the driveway. location is also very convenient to noe valley shops, the mission, the freeway, the castro, and many other areas. alex has taken the time to prepare the house for guests, even drawing a large chalk map of the neighborhood, that included business cards at their appropriate locations. we were impressed. i hope my family returns to sf in need of a nice home to stay in again so i get to spend more time in this beautiful house! this house is amazing.  you always worry a place won\\'t be as great as the pictures but all 5 of us loved this house.  it is set up perfect for families and for relaxing and enjoying the city.  every little touch is there for your enjoyment.  the hot tub was great and they had towels set right at the door for your use.  we will look forward to staying here the next time we visit our son who lives in palo alto.  this is perfect if traveling with large group.  so much better to have a house then multiple hotel rooms.  also nice to get away from the crowds after touring the city.  stay here you will be very happy you did.  the home was a great place to spend the holidays with my two daughters in san francisco. the views were beautiful, the street was quiet, the home has all the latest technology--we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. and alex is a most gracious host. thanks so much.we had a fantastic stay at alex\\'s house in noe valley over new year.  the house is great and very well situated, within easy striking distance of some fantastic restaurants and cafes as well as public transport links and supermarkets etc. and whilst being pretty central it\\'s a quiet neighborhood and street parking is really easy.  alex was also very easy to deal with.  all our queries were answered promptly and efficiently and we were made to feel very welcome.  we would definitely recommend both him and the house to others.     we recently stayed at alex\\'s house for a friends\\' reunion weekend and loved our experience.  the house is in impeccable condition and both the architecture and interior design were beautiful!  the view from the upstairs deck is unbelievable and the downstairs hot tub was a very nice touch.  as a host, alex was extremely responsive, always polite, and always willing to help wherever needed.  we had a few questions along the way and despite the fact that alex was out of the country, he still managed to respond promptly.  that said, the documents that were left in the house pretty much answered everything and included some really great recommendations for the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely come back to stay at alex\\'s house anytime i\\'m back in san francisco.  thanks again, alex!our family stayed at alex\\'s wonderful home in noe valley for 5 nights.  the home is even better than it looks in the photos.  the space is so well designed. alex (and presumably his wife whom we did not have the occasion to meet) have a meticulous design aesthetic.  their style is modern, streamlined, creative, and  most of all functional.  alex was very responsive when a fuse blew out.   i insisted he did not need to come to the home to fix it as it was just in one area of the kitchen and we were only there one more night, but he insisted that he drive in from the east bay to address the issue immediately.  he was pleasant and helpful and also very conscious about giving us \"our\" space.  he was also very nice about a misplaced key (which it turns out he found).  we were very happy about our choice and our stay. this home was amazing!  great location with beautiful views, spacious and comfortable!  alex was a great host and met us on arrival to show us around the property.  i would recommend his home to anyone interested in staying in san francisco!really excellent accommodation. i could/did spend hours on the terrace just watching the views of noe valley below. very complete kitchen so ideal if you feel like rustling up a meal. we found our rented car very useful for going down into the noe valley for food shopping etc.what a wonderful place to stay!  the views are incredible, the home is beautiful and the neighborhood is nice and quiet with lots of public transport options and restaurants near by.  it was the perfect place for our 10 day sf stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is a 6 star place! it\\'s stylish, very comfortable and a jacuzzi on the terrace with views over sf makes it really stand apart. we loved the espresso machine and complimentary beans, made us really feel at home :) \\r\\nthe kitchen has a lot of gear and was stocked with spices and oils.  \\r\\nbeds are comfy and the street is very quite at night, so well suited for a good night\\'s rest. \\r\\nalex is a superb host, early arrival was no problem at all, we received a warm welcome and he gave thoughtful tips prior to our stay as well as superfast answers on the questions we had. we stayed in the house during our family trip to california. after staying in several hotels prior to arriving in san francisco, it was a nice to be able to relax in a cozy home, with great views and a well-equipped kitchen. the basket of fruit and bottle of wine provided by alex on arrival were a thoughtful gesture. we loved the neighbourhood - quiet, yet close to restaurants and other amenities, and a short drive from many of the areas we wanted to visit in the city.  the house manual provided comprehensive and clear instructions about the house and the neighbourhood. we tried out a few of alex\\'s restaurant recommendations, and they were excellent. throughout the booking process and the time leading up to our stay, alex was always very responsive. we had a great time - thanks alex!alex was an incredibly thoughtful host, and his house was everything we wanted and more! my family and i stayed there for a 4-day trip to the city, and after a harrowing travel experience, coming home to the noe valley made us forget all of the craziness. we were thrilled with the all the arrangements - especially with the lovely hot tub and the beautiful balcony view of the city. the house had so much character and made us feel like we were really experiencing the eclectic charm of sf. alex really made our stay feel extra special. it was super easy getting in, and he was very responsive to any questions we had. no complaints whatsoever - highly, highly recommended!alex was very communicative and clear from the moment we booked this home for a summer family trip. the directions to his home, parking, etc., were all easy to follow. at the home there was a very well organized house instructions binder, and a thoughtful chalkboard diagram of the neighborhood, highlighting favorite places to eat, shop, etc. i don\\'t think the experience could have been easier, or more helpful. \\r\\nthe home, as is depicted in the photos, was beautiful, neat, welcoming and practical. it was even better than we could have hoped. the neighborhood is extremely cute. busy enough to satisfy anyone wanting to have fun, and be in \\'the mix\\', but the house was removed enough to be very peaceful. parking 2 cars was a little tight. i was concerned about the directions to pull my car up to the garage, blocking a portion of the sidewalk. living in la, there would be a ticket on my windshield for that in 2 minutes (literally), but obviously there\\'s an understanding in sf in place, as my car was there for 4 days straight, and no tickets. \\r\\nin summation, fantastic. full confidence in this rental, and alex. used this listing to host some of my co-workers during a company visit!\\r\\n\\r\\nthey loved everything about it and couldn\\'t stop raving about it all week!alex, our stay in san francisco was great and the comfort we found each morning taking our breakfast with the view from your appartment, tea time on your terrace and diner and chat in the open living room really made this a great experience.  \\r\\nalex was on leave when we arrived but he had prepared everything for us to feel welcome: basket of fruits, milk, orange juice...\\r\\namex place is in a great location as besides from the view and cosiness of the apartment, the neighborhood is great with what really felt like a small town \"ambiance\" : great shops, café and restaurant.\\r\\nthanks again and we will definetely recommend or come back!we absolutely loved this house and the neighborhood. as a party of 3 colleagues we all had our own room, a good size diner table to do some work and 2 outdoor spaces to enjoy the great view on the san francisco hills and the city center. it\\'s a unique 2 story house with lots of interesting design features in a quiet street.\\r\\nour conference was in the city, which was an easy 20 to 25 minute taxi ride into the city (depending on the time of day). in the evenings we enjoyed the restaurants and shops in the neighborhood, which appears very safe. the kitchen is well equipped and one wall is used to tell visitors what is where in the neighborhood. the house manual includes recommendations for restaurants in the area. all very helpful.\\r\\na special treat is the hot tub with a view of the city. just what we needed after a long conference day.\\r\\ncan definitely recommend this place if you want to explore san francisco from a local perspective. hardly any tourists in the neighborhood.we loved staying here. just to add to what others have said about alex\\'s wonderful apartment, despite being elegant enough to send you home with a bunch of interior design ideas we also found it a great place to stay with our kids. it\\'s very spacious and well equipped, with breakables well out of reach of little hands and feet. there\\'s a lovely park two minutes walk up the hill where our youngest enjoyed the swings, slides and climbing frame while the older ones played tennis on the court right next door. there\\'s a handy corner shop a minute away where you can get milk or cereal or pizza or whatever it is you suddenly realise you need last thing at night or first thing in the morning. and last but not least the j metro stops just a few blocks away so it\\'s easy to get downtown if you don\\'t want to drive.\\r\\n\\r\\nof course if you don\\'t have kids then you can spend more time checking out the many nearby restaurants or gazing at the stars from the hot tub, so that\\'s good too ;)\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks alex!alex is the perfect host. the apartment easily lives up to, if not exceeds its description: superb kitchen, excellent views, well-insulated building, quiet neighborhood, and the good taste of alex and diana defines san francisco panache.my family and i (5 of us) comfortably stayed there for 4 days. it is a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to everywhere we wanted to go. alex was very accommodating, this was a great choice.alex is an incredibly gracious and accommodating host. the listing is  absolutely stunning and very well equipped - probably the best airbnb i\\'ve seen. he was very prompt and proactive in communicating.i booked alex\\'s house for my friend and her family. her daughter who has just entered high school came sfo for visiting stanford university which is her dream school. knowing alex is alumni of stanford they were extremely excited. alex was truly helpful. below is my friend\\'s daughter\\'s comments for alex: \\n\\nthe house is awesome! the decoration and furniture in the house is really attractive.if you get up early, the view of the neighborhood during sunrise transforming from the darkness to brightness and light is as fabulous as shanghai at night. fyi, you can find basically everything you need for cooking in the kitchen. safeway is close so you can buy the ingredients you need there. diy our lunch and dinner is an interesting experience. alex, so warmhearted and helpful. the stay is such an enjoyment.\\n\\n thank you alex. hope i will have opportunity to stay at yours myself when i visit sfo. \\nwhat a lovely home! our family of four truly enjoyed our san francisco stay and were very comfortable in alex\\'s home. our host was extremely responsive. the neighborhood is our favorite in town and we are looking forward to our future visits.alex was such a wonderful host to our group! the listing is stunning and uniquely designed with incredible views of noe valley. i recommend this to anyone looking to visit san francisco and stay in a modern listing with a lot of character. the location is perfect for walking around the charming neighborhood of noe valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nalex was responsive and helpful to every question or need. i highly recommend!my girlfriend and i stayed at alex\\'s home for one week. the home was very clean and tidy and alex\\'s attention to all details of our stay contributed to an excellent experience. the neighborhood is also very well located - very close to the the mission and castro which are within walking distance (if you are not in a rush) and also a quick ride to anywhere in the city by cab or public transport. noe valley itself is quiet and almost has a small town feel, so you can appreciate very different aspects of the city by staying here. there are many shops and restaurants nearby worth exploring and my girlfriend spent a couple of days contently exploring the area without having to venture into the city center every day, although that was an easy option as well. the home is perched up on a hill with a great view. the pictures in the posting are an accurate depiction of the home although the photos don\\'t capture the true greatness of the view. becuase of the length of our stay, we were looking for a place where we could feel like we were enjoying the beautiful surroundings of the city as much as possible even when we were relaxing at the house. the layout of alex\\'s home certainly creates this environment, whether preparing dinner in the kitchen overlooking the valley through the wide sliding glass doors or soaking in the hot tub downstairs. alex was very friendly and considerate and very tentative to any need. although we did not have a chance to meet in person we felt that he would have showed up on short notice if any help was requested. i we would highly recommend this location and would not hesitate to stay again ourselves if we need a place in the city for a few days.we had such a great stay at alex\\'s place.  the decor was perfect, the view was beautiful, very clean and we had plenty of space in the place.   the auto locks were super convenient for a late evening arrival.  absolutely loved the hand-drawn map of the neighborhood in the kitchen!!alex was an excellent host with very prompt communication and always willing to answer any question. his apartment is stunning with great views of san francisco and lovely decor inside. we stayed there as two small families and found it had plenty of space for us and in a great location. i traveled with 5 friends and we do love the house! this is my second time to san francisco and i was so impressive about this house. it is clean and well decorated. we cooked and the kitchen was well equipped. we enjoy having tea and chat outdoor in the morning with the wonderful view of the city with the twin peak! it is also highly appreciated the map with pinned name cards in the kitchen to show nearby recommended restaurants. alex also prepared us a little card on the fresh fruit to welcome us. we all enjoyed to gather in this lovely house. lovely home within walking distance to 24th st. restaurants, shopping, etc. in the noe valley and convenient to so much in san francisco.  the home was nicely furnished and the host was most accommodating (a request for hand soap, for example, resulted in same day delivery - which was most impressive).   you will not regret this selection for a visit to the area. alex was an incredible host! this is my second time booking this listing, and he is so communicative, welcoming, and available to answer any questions. this is a beautiful listing with incredible design, and a great location in noe valley. i can\\'t recommend alex and his home enough! this is hands down the best air b&b i\\'ve stayed in. alex was an impeachable host - extremely responsive, welcoming and accommodating. it was a pleasure to meet alex in person and he very generously left a cheese board and a bottle of prosecco to welcome us! the house itself is stunning (so much so that it could be in a magazine) with beautiful decor, fun, high-tech gadgets and unforgettable views of san francisco from the 2 terraces. the location is great with lots of nice cafes and restaurants. the house is also close to public transport and to the castro and mission. alex\\'s house would be perfect for families, friends and colleagues alike and could very easily fit 6 people. it was an absolute treat to stay in alex\\'s place (and very hard to leave!) and i would highly recommend it to anyone visiting san francisco. a huge thank you for your hospitality alex! we loved your place and hope to stay here again soon!alex is a great and very considerate host. he gave us a warm welcome and made a good preparation to make us have a very comfortable stay. his house is fantastic with a great view. you will love his house and design. it\\'s also quite convenient to go around and alex would give u a detailed guide. overall, we enjoy staying in his house and it was a great experience. i stayed here with a couple of my colleagues and we all had an amazing time in this stylish and comfortable home.  this is airbnb done perfectly right.  the house was exactly as described and even more -tastefully decorated, spacious, quiet with lots of natural light, equipped with everything imaginable (especially, the kitchen!), with an amazing view of the sf landscape, only a few blocks away from one of the most charming neighborhoods of the city it was hard to choose whether to stay in or go out!   what made our experience even better was the host alex and his welcoming thoughtful touches.  i highly recommend this listing and will definitely go back on my next trip out to sf.   this property was really impressive. from the property itself, the automation found within, the little touches provided by alex, everything had been thoughtfully considered.\\r\\n\\r\\nmyself and two other colleagues came to sf for dreamforce. yay #df15! we had stayed in the conference hotels in years prior and were seeking a more authentic san francisco experience. this property totally delivered.\\r\\n\\r\\ni can\\'t say enough about the small touches which really add up. first the property was clean. all of us are particular types and none of us felt that any of the primary surfaces needed attention. additionally, the espresso machine with fresh coffee was great fuel for each of our days which were packed to the max. guys forget soap. we do. alex had soap and shampoo in the showers ready to go.\\r\\n\\r\\ni could go on but i will just say that you will experience the conveniences of a hotel plus the conveniences of a home. a wonderful mix.\\r\\n\\r\\nin all, we would definitely consider staying here for our next trip to the city.\\r\\nalex was wonderful to talk to and really made me feel like his home was my home. truly one of the best experiences i have ever had on airbnb. the home is lovely, the view spectacular and the location is excellent. i highly recommend alex!alex hosted my parents during the holidays and they had an excellent time!  he had coffee, milk and juice upon their arrival and made sure they were well acquainted with features of the home.  he also arranged for a cleaning during their stay as they were there for nearly 2 two weeks.  he was responsive and the home absolutely lovely and inviting.  beautiful house and wonderful host. location is perfect and the house is very clean. we will stay there again. alex was so responsive and kindly arranged for a bottle of champagne and fruit for our arrival!  the area is walking distance to some wonderful shops, bakeries, farmers mkt, whole foods and cafes.  his place is wonderful and we would happily return! \\r\\ncommunication with alex is amazing, he is polite and responded all of my questions very very fast! i felt he was always available when we needed it. the house is beautiful, it was a breath-taking view, it was perfectly clean, it is fully equipped and it had everything we needed! the neighbourhood is very quite, but close to a main street that has grocery shops, restaurants, bars, yoga studios, everything. \\r\\ni really enjoyed my time in sf and the house was definitely part of the wonderful experience. i recommend this house 100% \\r\\ni hope to come back soon!!! :)we really enjoyed our stay at this house. alex was the perfect host - super communicative and the house was flawless.  bubbly, milk and oj left for our stay and the house was super clean.  it worked really well for our family of five and our small dogs.  walking distance to fantastic restaurants, bars and small shops.  we will stay here again in sf and tell all of our friends about it.i warmly recommend alex house. excellent location (quiet neighborhood yet close to mission and castro), comfortable and stylish. \\r\\non top of that, the communication with alex has been very easy and efficient. \\r\\none of the best experience on airbnb so far.alex is a great host who understands what makes an airbnb stay great. his house is set amongst the hills of noe valley and offers wonderful views across the city, whilst be central enough to offer great amenities. we we\\'re welcomed with fresh provisions and a very easy check in process. the discovery of a hot tub was a total bonus! far away from home we felt absolutely at home! this house has everything you need! also very well decorated and had small things like juice and bottle of water waiting for us. we spent most of the warm nights on the terrace overlooking the beautiful san francisco! watched movies on the projector and had jacuzzi every second night!\\r\\n\\r\\nnot a single doubt we would want to come back to this house next time we are in san francisco!i can\\'t say enough how welcome we felt in alex\\'s home.  the place is beautiful and clean, in an awesome neighborhood and they even left fruit and prosecco for us to start the weekend off with.  also, he let us check in early and offered to let stay a little late if we needed.  thanks for the hospitality alex, i highly recommend your home!alex has been a great host with a high sense of hospitality. our experience was exactly like what a perfect airbnb stay should look like.\\nhe provided a lot of tips before and during our stay, and has been very responsive and efficient to handle an unexpected issue.\\ni can only recommend alex and tammi\\'s place, and will definitely stay there for my next visit to sf!we had a great stay at frances\\' place. we booked this room and another room and it was really nice: the place is conveniently located to access transportation and explore the city, and yet the area is quiet with great views of downtown sf, mission and twin peaks!i just returned from 7 nights at this beautiful home and i highly recommend it.  it\\'s quiet, clean, and exceptionally comfortable.  fran has great taste so you will enjoy the art and the whole ambiance of the setting.  views are gorgeous and location good for walking or catching public transportation.  i felt safe inside and out.  my room was very comfortable with an excellent bed, great sheets,  pillows, blankets - i slept super well.  the bathroom is roomy with a wonderful huge shower.  the house is built very well and everything seems to be of high quality.  i look forward to returning soon!  fran is gracious, generous, and  an easy -going host.  also very helpful when i needed anything whether it was information or something tangible.  what a lovely experience!gotta love fran\\'s in potrero! my only regret is that i didn\\'t spend more time there, enjoying her beautiful, sunny home. \\r\\n\\r\\nvery clean, modern, comfortable. the room itself was perfect, but the private deck with views of the city/bay is what really won me over. thanks again, fran! staying at fran\\'s was my first experience with airbnb and it wont be my last.  fran was welcoming and gracious, serving me a cup of tea upon arrival and generally helping me to feel right at home.  my room was comfortable and the view from the adjoining rooftop deck was spectacular.  i would definitely stay with fran again!\\r\\njust what we needed for our 2 day city break - we came, we slept, we drank great coffee, enjoyed the view from the adjoining deck and we had great chats with fran on the way in and out to check out both the city and the local cafes of potrero hill. a great, quiet, clean and comfortable room and fran is a great, helpful, but not intrusive host. staying with fran was great. i enjoyed being in her house which is beautifully located high up on potrero hill with a great view over the city. i always turned around and looked at the sf skyline when coming home in the evenings.\\r\\n\\r\\nfran is a great host and her house is decorated with taste (southern style), the room had enough space and a view over the city. everything is new, clean, quiet and perfect to relax after an intense day in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nchatting with fran has always been great, she is very flexible, welcoming and friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\ni can recommend staying at this place.wow, what a view!  the house is amazing and fran is an excellent host.  everything was nice and clean for me when i arrived and i didn\\'t have any problems while i was there.  and did i mention there is a hot

stay here again and i will be recommending fran to all my friends!i have stayed in more than a dozen homes on airbnb in san francisco and this is definitely one of the best! fran is a super friendly and hospitable host and her house is very modern and tasteful in a quiet, central neighborhood.  the view from the roofdeck is extraordinary and there is a table and chair to enjoy the sun. if you are travelling by yourself or in a couple and don\\'t need an entire home, this might be one of the best places in the city to stay!fabulous house, wonderful potrero hill location,gracious hostess and  we look forward to making it our san francisco home-away-from home.\\r\\nfran\\'s place in potrero hill is incredible. views from every window, classy and clean. a friend and i spent two nights there. we soaked in the hot tub, complete with a sweeping view of the city -- you can even see the top of the golden gate bridge -- with our coffees each morning, had a happy hour dip and even arranged our first night to be back in time for a soak before the 10 p.m. hot tub curfew. the bed was super comfy, the sheets soft, the bathroom large and clean. fran was friendly and helpful, suggesting events, restaurants and city travel tips. i\\'ll be back, for sure. a delightful home in a great location overlooking san francisco.fran\\'s house is immaculate.  her presentation is amazing and as a host she was more than accommodating.  she has thought of everything.  \\r\\n\\r\\nhere are a few quick points about the experience:\\r\\n\\r\\nfran: from the moment we arrived, i could tell fran was going to be a good host.  she showed us around the place and even offered us access her food, drinks, coffee, and even the beer she had left over in the fridge. fran was also very helpful giving tips on restaurants nearby. she was truly more than you could ask for from a host.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house: potrero hill provides amazing views and safety. we never once felt that our belongings or vehicle was insecure.  the house cannot be beaten. her place is truly beautiful with views of the sf hills from all sides, an entry garden, two person shower, and quaint backyard with hot tub.\\r\\n \\r\\nthe hot tub: the hot tub deserves its own category.  this is a must do! the views from the tub alone make our whole stay worthwhile!  do not miss this experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a great time at fran\\'s

highly recommended!great spot, gorgeous views, reasonable price!wonderful stay at frans, i would highly recommend this spot! it was an ideal location for the purpose of my trip, but anyone would enjoy the beautiful views of the city from portrero hill. the entire home is gorgeous and clean, fully stocked kitchen if you need to cook, or just make a quick breakfast in the mornings. the host was a great communicator and clear with her instructions and directions. lastly, the hot tub is absolutely amazing!!! take a relaxing evening while there to just soak and you won\\'t regret it!i decided to treat my wife to a weekend in the city at the last minute.  this was our first airbnb experience.  fran was very quick to get back to me with answers to all of my questions.  she was up front about needing us to check-out early on saturday and allowed us to check-in early on thursday.  \\r\\n\\r\\ncommunication was great and the room was exactly as described and seen in pictures.  the highlight of the stay was my wife and i watching the 4th of july fireworks from the hot tub.  the house overlooks most of the city.  \\r\\n\\r\\noverall this was a good experience and i would recommend anyone looking for a relaxing place to stay in sf to stay here.  well within walking distance of the mission district, at&t park, and many other sf locations.  there was also plenty of free street parking.

would definitely return! staying with fran was much better than any hotel at the same price!stayed at fran\\'s a couple nights. was a good first airbnb experience. close to plenty of entertainment, bus systems, downtown. seemed like a safe area. the home was in great shape - clean, new and professional in appearance. \\r\\n\\r\\nfran was helpful in getting directions around the area, or knowing if where i may walk to would be safe. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe view from the upstairs patio was excellent, as well as downstairs patio. could see most of downtown. great area to just chill. communication with fran was really easy. we arrived at a time when she was not at home, but she arranged us a really convenient check-in. parking spot was easy to find just in front of her house. she had an amazing hot-tub that we had a chance to use. we were able to see the city of san francisco by night just sitting in the tub! our room was upstairs- it was really modern and well decorated, and we had our own roof top balcony, where you were able to see the city again. the bathroom was extremely cosy with a rooftop window and showering was made nice with fluffy nice towels. fran´s apartment has really a

garden, very nice big deck with amazing cityview! everytime again!!! very nice place to stay. host was pleasant and communications were flowing all through the booking... the no. 19 bus was convenient, not too hilly getting back to our digs.. nice to come \\'home\\' at the end of a hectic day, rather than a pokie motel room...we so enjoyed the lovely private deck right off of our comfortable room, and especially enjoyed returning from full days of sightseeing in san francisco to soak in the relaxing outdoor hot tub. nice! we enjoy walking so the hill down to the bus line worked for us, but may not be as accessible for some. we had as wonderful stay in fran\\'s house. a beautiful home with stunning views of the city. we enjoyed the hot tub - a great way to take in the views. after a frantic week of travel i was looking for somewhere to really relax while exploring san francisco. i could not have chosen a comfier place - exactly what i was after. it takes about 30 minutes to walk to the mission district and buses leave from close by if you need to go further. the hot tub was just beautiful after long days exploring the city and i\\'ve possibly never slept on a comfier bed! fran was friendly and helpful.fran was a fantastic host, interesting to talk to and very helpful with the details. we particularly enjoyed the use of the hot tub outside - it has an incredible view of the city and at night it\\'s not to be missed.\\n\\nthe room was great, the bed was very comfortable, and the entire house was relaxed and welcoming. this is an amazing stay, and my wife and i can\\'t recommend it highly enough.fran\\'s home was most lovely with great views of the city. slept so well because the bed was great & it was quiet which is a treat to what i\\'ve been

experience.fran was super organized and easy to communicate with and her home was the perfect spot, gorgeous view and lovely bed!  the keyless entry made the experience really easy to navigate and fran was friendly but gave us all the privacy we wanted :)  thanks fran!fran was great.  the room was very clean and quiet.  it was also super easy to get in and out with the electronic lock system on the front door. fran\\'s home is lovely and in the perfect location with beautiful sweeping views of san francisco. we used public transit for the most part and her house is walking distance to several different bus routes that made it easy for us get around the city. the bedroom was a great size with a very comfortable mattress and a nice little deck. the bathroom was also very spacious and comfortable.  we loved out stay here and will def stay again if we visit again.  thank you for a lovely visit, fran!\\r\\nfran\\'s place is gorgeous and welcoming! we got in late and the beds were comfy and cozy for these weary travelers.  we were excited about the hot tub and disappointed to learn it wasn\\'t quite ready for us til next day but when it was ready, it was nice and clean and the perfect temp!  we look forward to returning here next time!fran was very welcoming and a great host, i thoroughly enjoyed my stay! \\r\\n\\r\\nbeautiful house, great location!even though it was too chilly for the hot tub, fran is a wonderful host and the house is quiet, clean and beautiful! fran is a wonderful host! potrero hill is a vibrant family neighborhood with stunning views of the city. there are some great restaurants nearby and we took argentine tango lessons the metreon dance collective on 17th. we arrived via caltrain and took the local bus to the heart of sf, a short ride to pacific heights. fran\\'s accommodations are top notch! there is also plenty of parking if you are not the public transit users that we are.\\r\\nfran is a gracious host who went out of her way to make my stay enjoyable. her home is beautiful, the beds are comfy, and the view from the hot tub is breathtaking! fran\\'s house is fabulous - its spanish charm and paintings are very impressive. it\\'s like a brand new house. it is located in one of the best blocks of potrero hill with easy access for street parking. i recommend other guest to stay at fran\\'s house. my husband and i really enjoyed our stay at fran\\'s. the home is well decorated with beautiful artwork and felt like a \"home away from home\". guests will enjoy the jacuzzi tub and views over the city and valley. the location is in walking distance of great restaurants and there is plenty of parking. we will definitely be back to enjoy it again! thank you fran for all the information and helpful tips!\\r\\nfran\\'s home was one of the most beautiful place i\\'ve ever stayed. it\\'s situated on a hill, allowing for 360 views from the upstairs balconies. it was immaculately clean and tastily decorated. my biggest regret was not going in the hot tub due to a busy conference schedule. highly recommended.wonderful stay in a comfortable house. i was in the bay area for most of the week making business calls up and down highway 101. the house was very convenient to the freeway. i could get off just before the traffic backup into the city. \\r\\ngreat room and one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in! i had the room that allows you to walk out on the deck, a great way to wake up to the city skyline. the bathroom is just down the hall and is spotless and large. never ran into the occupants of the other room. :-)  i will be staying here again. \\r\\ni will stay here again. fran is a very gracious, friendly and accommodating host.\\r\\nthe facilities are excellent, the views amazing.\\r\\nthe electronic lock makes things easy.\\r\\nwill definitely stay again.hidden heaven in potrero hill. lovely house, views, host. i can\\'t say too strongly what a welcoming, pleasant and relaxing stay this was. (bonus: only a few blocks from the anchor steam brewery, one of the best ways in sf to spend a lazy afternoon.)fran\\'s place is a beautiful house perched on potrero hill, with stunning views of the harbor and city. the hot tub in the back garden is just fabulous! we enjoyed our stay in san francisco - the house is very attractive, and fran welcoming. the room was rather smaller than we had expected, but adequate for our needs, and it opened onto the deck giving welcome outdoor space. the potrero hill area is calm and beautiful, but does not have easy transport links to downtown - or at least we didn\\'t find them. \\r\\nviv m april 2014beautiful home with well-appointed furnishings and fabulous art.  exceeded only by the views.  fran creates an ambience that is informal and warm.  easy to the city.fran is great and her house is beautiful.  very pleasant experience and i look forward to going back!i was in san francisco to visit the city and the stanford campus in palo alto. fran\\'s place is awesome, and so is her hospitality! i stayed at her place for three nights and felt very much at home. i used public transport which was very convenient (although most people seem to rent a car to get around). i would definitely come back!excellent location, a great home with a great view. absolutely as advertised. gracious host and highly recommend to anyone. san francisco at its finest.fran was great.  nice, clean room.  i had the east facing room.  (there are two on the top floor which share a common bath.)  bath is very nice.  great shower. good variety of pillows. very comfortable bed.  good ventilation in bedroom.  nice touch to have computer speakers on the desk so i could listen to music. nice quiet neighborhood.  very convenient to have a keypad entry. the house isn\\'t very convenient to bart if that is how you are planning on getting around town.  bus service is closer, but i didn\\'t use it. 16th st station is about a 20 minute walk.  if you have any mobility issues, be forewarned, walking is a challenge because of the hills.  you need to be in good shape.  i can\\'t comment on ease of parking as i was walking the entire time.fran is a lovely person , considerate and friendly. very approachable if you have questions about where and what to do in san francisco. the house was very much so as described.the views are panaromic. did not get the time to use the hot tub due to my workshop schedule being tight while in sf.a full length dressing mirror in the room was missing. overall i had a great time staying with fran.   i had a nice stay at fran\\'s place. it is a beautiful spot that\\'s well taken care of. fran most definitely pays great attention to detail and made me feel very welcome in her home. there was a pretty consistent shuffle of other guests staying in the room down the hall from mine. it did not affect my stay at all, but is something to consider if you are looking for a very private experience. we really enjoyed our stay at fran\\'s. she was very welcoming, and the house was great. electronic keypad made coming/going very easy, the room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was top-notch. the only things that could have made it better was if the bathroom wasn\\'t shared with other guests, and the hot tub was available after 10, but i understand why it wasn\\'t. this is in a very nice and well appointed home.  fran is a wonderful host and was very helpful.  i\\'m a \"foodie,\" so i appreciated her guidance around local restaurant recommendations.  remarkable and authentic house in ideal location. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  also, we enjoyed fran\\'s company as well as her other airbnb guest.  fran is a very nice host with a beautiful house in one of the san francisco hills, offering an exquisite view on the city. the deck is pleasant and the outdoor hot-tub is definately the icing on the cake. the house is very quiet but still 3 minutes away from the highway entrance and with lots of parking making it also very convenient. i also recommend the deli nearby (chiotras grocery), with its wine and chesse selection, great sandwiches and its private deck, another little hidden gems of the city. with fran\\'s house, that makes two gems in the same location !i had planned a trip for my mother who lives abroad and had not traveled in over 7 years - she was very nervous to say the least, and i wanted to ensure that her arrival in sf to be comfortable and welcoming.   \\r\\nthe room was bright, cozy and private (really enjoyed the balcony).  fran was consistently accommodating and very responsive - we checked in late and she went out of her way to make sure we were settled in.  she was very patient in answering our numerous questions throughout the stay.  overall - professional, yet relaxed and easy.   fran has set the standard by which i will measure all future airbnb experiences!  her home is absolutely gorgeous and she made sure that my best friend and i saw the best of sf.  fran\\'s home is close to public transport so we could get to where we wanted to go in the city with ease.  she was so accommodating, allowing us to store our luggage in her home before our evening bus to sacramento.  i will definitely book with fran on my next visit to sf and will be sure to take a dip in the hot tub.  thanks for a wonderful stay, fran!  great place with a nice balcony to relax in the evening. nice view of the city and bay bridge and a good stroll to the city.\\r\\nroom is a good size and the shower is great.\\r\\nit was my first time using airbnb, i can only hope they all are like this.fran was a great host. we had some good chats with her! the room (we stayed in the east room) was wonderful. the view of the city from the deck was awesome. the house is beautiful. we didn\\'t have the opportunity to meet fran but loved her taste in decor and scenic views. her place is the ideal airbnb experience. the room was very cozy and accurately described with an added bonus of the larger outdoor patio. views were phenomenal - you have an unobstructed viewpoint from the bay bridge all the way to dolores park. the whole house was clean and tidy with little details which made the experience even better.  the bathroom and shower were both spacious and would rival a five-star hotel! access to wash laundry or make a cup of tea was perfect for unwinding from a busy day of exploring the city. climbed a few hills to get to the tasty local eateries but it was worth it. there is a nice whole foods located three blocks down hill  and places in the neighborhood close around 10pm. my wife and i had a great experience staying at fran\\'s home! the neighborhood is easily accessible to the rest of the city via transit, as long as you can handle walking a few blocks up the steep hill. the home is absolutely beautiful, clean, and modern, with very nice views over the city and into downtown. make sure to enjoy the view from the hot tub! we would definitely stay here again next time we\\'re in san francisco.the home is lovely and fran is great.  she\\'s helpful, accommodating, but not in your business.  i\\'m a bit of a clean freak and the home certainly met my comfort requirements.  i was in town for work so the deck off to the side of my room was a nice place to get my head together and prepare myself for the day/evening.  i had never stayed in this part of sf and while you\\'re a little removed from the action zones of the city the view is better than what you would have on top of hill st or sanchez.  i got to jump in the hot tub one day prior to a gig and it was quite nice!\\r\\n\\r\\ni would stay here again, but with that said i think the listing should remove the \"1 bathroom\" as it is a shared bathroom w/ the guests across the hall and the \"1 bathroom\" would indicate private.  fran communicated proactively before and on the day of and gave very clear instructions. the house is very stylish and clean. this was a very positive first experience with airbnb. if i\\'m in town again, i would stay at fran\\'s place.everything was just as described. beautiful, clean, organized accommodations . information to maximize our visit. super location with outstanding views. would recommend and return ourselves.beautiful house in great location. a little way from the shopping and restaurant district but easy to get to with public transport. fran was a great host, friendly and welcoming and her home is stylish and comfortable and the hot hub with amazing views is a real bonus. fran\\'s house was as excellent as portrayed in the listing.  amazing clean, comfortable and well-appointed, and fran was very hospitable.  she was around for conversations at the end of the day if i wanted to talk and otherwise made me feel very comfortable in her home.  the views of the city from potrero hill are generally excellent and at fran\\'s house they were really outstanding -- basically 360 degree views of twin peaks, downtown and the bay.  there were other guests across the hall but i barely noticed them.  i would recommend to a friend.fran is the perfect host. she provides a beautiful house and some great information about sf. especially the hot tub with the view over sf is amazing. i would choose this housing again anytime.great room, beautiful view at the city. easy to reach with public transportation. great city trip tips! the house is just amazing with incredible views and everything very well organized and prepared since the beginning.  our host had to leave town and we did not know if she was returning any day soon.  beautiful home just has described.  we were so busy visiting that we did not miss seeing someone at home.  it\\'s a good place to stay and recommend it highly.  this place is gorgeous, and fran is a great host. we had a great visit.we had a great time at fran\\'s place and we would definitely stay there again! we loved the hot tub and the amazing views of the city, it doesnt\\'t get any better! thank you,fran!we stayed for 4 days in frans beautiful home, just outside the sf centre. everything was exactly as described, or better. the room (and house) is spacious enough, comfy and clean. the house is easy to find, great to reach by car (5 minutes of the interstate), with plenty of parking right outside the front door. ideal if you\\'re road tripping and need to leave your car somewhere. the bus to the the centre stops only 3 minutes away, and will take you to down town san fransisco within 15 minutes. the shared bathroom got us a bit worried at fist, but that was totally not necessary (and pretty well indicated up front). it\\'s shared with only one other room, and if you happen to run into planning issues with other guests, fran has an extra full bathroom you can use. the bathroom itself is great. very spacious with a great shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nnot only the room, but the host is pretty awesome as well. we arrived pretty late in the evening, but fran stayed up to welcome us. she gives you plenty of privacy if you want to, but is always there to chat or when you have any questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hot tub is a nice bonus. we enjoyed it while watching the sun set over the city. pretty cool!fran is simply amazing.  her home is inviting, beautifully decorated, and extremely quiet with the most comfortable beds. the location is ideal and parking is easy.  i particularly enjoyed the lovely morning views which were very beautiful.  everything about my stay was pleasant.  fran was helpful with restaurant suggestions as well as other entertainment recommendations.  she\\'s a constant professional as a host and i wholeheartedly recommend this spot for a visit to san francisco.perfect neighborhood, ideal for the start of your daily trips to sfo. easy to park your car and take the bus downtown. \\r\\nour program was pretty full, therefor we didn\\'t had much time to talk to fran more than just the basics. she is a very nice and helpful host. the room was clean and spacious and the bed was absolutely perfect. \\r\\neverything was well communicated. would recommend. we enjoyed our stay on potrero hill.  fran greeted us warmly and provided plenty of information about the neighborhood.  parking nearby on the street was no problem, and the area was convenient for visiting our friends around the city.  our room was charming and well-appointed, the bed was very comfortable, and the house itself was beautifully decorated with colorful paintings and beautiful furniture.  the views to the west over san francisco were gorgeous, both from our bedroom and from the large windowed wall in the living room.  our only regret was that we didn\\'t have time to try the hot tub...we\\'ll make it a priority when we visit next.fran\\'s place is beautiful! peaceful, tucked away on the top of the hill, and quiet. fran was kind enough to open the door for us at 11:00 pm as i hadn\\'t realized her code pad was temporarily down :/ !\\nthe room is small and cozy and the bathroom is great. we shared the upstairs with another couple (room across the hall and weren\\'t disturbed by any noise).\\nthanks fran for a fun stay!beautiful home with even more beautiful views!\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat location, comfortable room, and excellent host!fran was a great host, very well organised and is a true airbnb professional. the room i rented and the house was exactly as described and very much look forward to visiting again in the future.\\r\\nthe neighborhood was very safe with a whole foods store and local bar nearby just as outlined in the listing.\\r\\nfran was fast and efficient at communicating always keeping me informed of local info and details on traveling to the property with clear instructions on access into the property.\\r\\ni highly recommend making use of the hot tub :)\\r\\nthanks again fran - what a great visit.fran\\'s place is without a doubt my most positive experience staying anywhere ever other than my own home, not exaggerating.  she is a sweet hostess, open to leaving me to my own business, or including me in her company as i wanted to.  her other guest at the time i was there is bound to be one of my best friends when i move there, as will fran be.  if you are not social and want privacy, it\\'s ok and this is still a great place, but if you also want an experience feeling welcome like you\\'re visiting a friend, you will love staying with fran.  thanks fran for making my trip to san francisco so enjoyable.  all of my friends are so excited about this experience as a glimpse into what my move there will be like!  i appreciate you and your hospitality! and it doesn\\'t hurt that lisa, your other guest, is a retired chef!  :-)beautiful house, great location, and very nice accommodations.  fran was a very gracious host and invited me to join her and a few friends that she had over that day for some wine and home-made peach cobbler for dessert.  the hot tub and view from it was simply amazing!

sharon is a nice host who helps us to set everything up. we reached our expectation here. thank you sharon!sharon has been a great host. we were a large group of eight, our first time in san francisco, and we were all very comfortable in four bedrooms, with two beds in each. the house is very clean as sharon had a cleaner come by after the previous guest had checked out. sharon was also very understanding when i made a mistake with our arrival time (i had mentioned 11pm instead of 11am) and she was flexible with arranging an earlier check in for us to drop off our heavy luggage. she was also thoughtful enough to make room for us to park our rented suv outside her garage when i told her that we\\'d gotten a $100 ticket for parking in the neighbour\\'s way (we were unfamiliar with the street rules...). our only issue we had with traveling as a large group was having to share one toilet, as we took about 3 hours to leave the house (so bear this in mind if you have a tight itinerary). i am absolutely love this place and also sharon is really really nice and care about us!great place to stay for groups!! extremely clean and the host is amazing, she so flexible with our check in time!! she was also kind enough to provide a baby\\'s playpin for us!!\\n\\ni would definitely stay here again, convenient location near restaurants and even whole foods market!! \\n\\nonly thing to consider there is only one bathroom for the group but for us was not a big of an issue..\\n\\na+! :)sharon was a good host. even though we only met at check-in, she made sure in advance that we have everything that we might need ready (cutlery, plates, toiletries, towels). \\r\\nthe neighbourhood is alright, safe and quiet.\\r\\nthere\\'s a single - point we encountered during our stay: above the rented property is the house where sharon leaves and the phonic isolation is not best. although i bet she made all possible to be as silent as possible, most of the noises get through the walls.\\r\\nto sum up, i recommend sharon and her property to whomever wants to visit sf and score an excellent value for the money ratio.great house in a great neighborhood. clean, quiet. sharon was very accommodating. would definitely stay here again.sharon was polite and helpful, and we were very comfortable in the place for our stay. great place forma the price. sharon is ver y friendly.sharon was a great host and responded immediately to any requests. the place was as described, clean and very cozy. sharon is very nice. although there is only one bathroom, we have a great time there.this was a very nice place to stay for our larger group. we had our own private area on the bottom floor and the parking on the street was very convenient. sharon was very accommodating and i would recommend staying here. great place, great service. we did have a great time in her house. we\\'ve stayed at sharon\\'s place for two nights!

 she made our stay so easy! the flat was perfectly sized for à 7 people group (2 kids, 1 teenager and 2 couples) and a perfect spot for acclimating ourselves right after landing in sf. the park nearby was useful early in the morning for jetlagged kids, the neighborhood was all right and provided a few places to buy food to go.  the flat is perfectly adapted and accessible with a wheelchair, up to the bathroom. the dining room, even with no kitchen allows breakfasts, picnics or warming up some food with the microwave.\\nsharon was very welcoming.we booked the home for four people and had our meetings there during the day. the living was big enough for 8 people to gather. there was a small dorm-size fridge and small microwave in the living room. no sink. no kitchen.\\n\\nthe pictures made the place look a lot better. airbnb photograhers did a good job.\\n\\nthe pros: sharon was nice to bring us a wine opener, a knife, and a cutting board when we requested it. parking in the neighborhood wasn\\'t too bad.\\n\\nthe cons: the until is on the ground floor. there were people, the owners, who live above the rental unit. we often hear people talking or making noises. on a friday night, around 1am, someone came home to the unit above us and made a lot of noises. high heels walking on the floor and doors slamming. that woke everyone up.\\n\\nalso, the furniture, especially the beds and mattresses were cheap. don\\'t expect thick mattresses, but instead a two-inch cushion to sleep on.\\n\\noverall, it was an ok experience. i am not sure if i would rent again for the going price.such a great host and communication was very satisfied with a quick response all the time. clean and comfy living room and bedrooms! sharon was very responsive and welcoming, less than 5 min response time to any of my messages, most of them even within 1 min! the house had everything we needed and we enjoyed our stay. we were a group of 4 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is quiet and peaceful, pretty easy to find parking. easy to get to downtown sf as well as the highway. really ideal location for business travelers.\\r\\nwe experienced two happy christmas nights in sharon\\'s house. thanks sharon for giving us the rent in time after we lost contact with our original host. the house was very clean, bright and warm. we had 7 people and everyone got a bed. the neighbor was quiet and we all had a good sleep.we were a group of 7 travelling in san francisco. we had a pleasant 3 day experience at sharon\\'s place. each one of us were provided with a bed to sleep on, which was impressive considering the amount of people we had. our questions got replied very promptly. the only advice i can give for future guests is that there was only one bathroom and also noise reduction wasn\\'t the house\\'s strength. so be mindful of that.girls of 6 enjoyed their stay thanking for hosting us. the apartment has very good design of rooms idea for 4,but 6 is good too.listing accurate, no problems, decent area with a couple of nice bars (broken record the best) happy with our staythanksthe host is very nice and friendly. i have experienced two wonderful night.we had a very pleasant stay at adam\\'s house !

 i forgot to bring towels but david had more than enough to go around.  love staying here and will do so again!this place is awesome.  very spacious, modern, and it\\'s in a quiet neighborhoods.  parking isn\\'t really a problem surprisingly.  i booked this spot for my wedding and it had the bachelor feel to it.  david was very accommodating. i would definitely stay again for another event!unparalleled experience in terms of value and comfort. jeff and joy are a rare combination of hospitality and generosity. i\\'d book this place on a permanent basis if it wasn\\'t for the ny commute to work being a little rough from sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nspecifics:\\r\\n- beyond spacious room and apartment\\r\\n- high end finish on the place\\r\\n- high speed internet access\\r\\n- gratuitous amount of outdoor space\\r\\n- location is so on point it could split an arrow with another arrow\\r\\n- essentially your own bathroom & shower\\r\\n- delightfully helpful and accommodating hostswe had such a good time staying in jeff & joy\\'s guest room! the room is clean and spacious with a great bed. the private deck was so cool and the room faced away from street noise so it felt very private and cozy. the room has adorable whimsical pillows and lights which gave it character--you can tell j&j are cool, fun folks. (unfortunately the super mario power-up block lamp did not give us special powers, but it did light up and we giggled each time we used it.)\\r\\nj&j were incredibly welcoming and their whole apartment is beautiful with a fantastic kitchen and living room. we had a great time exploring the neighborhood. delores park is super close and there are a ton of amazing restaurants near by as well as a beautiful yarn shop (imagiknit!).  i would highly recommend staying here when you visit san francisco! i\\'ve stayed with joy and jeff before, so the experience felt familiar and comfortable. even though both of them were still at work when i arrived, i had no trouble getting the keys. the big difference this time was that they now have a puppy, and it is extremely fluffy and friendly. if you have dog allergies like i do, it can\\'t hurt to get some antihistamines, just to be safe. after playing with the dog, my allergies were only slightly noticeable. no regrets.joanne\\'s place was perfect! she was unnecessarily accommodating, the house was gorgeous and from booking the checkout the process was seamless. highly recommend! we had a wonderful stay at this house.  it was very comfortable and remarkably spacious for the city.  the high ceilings and abundance of sunlight certainly added to that sense of openness.  beds were very comfortable and it has absolutely every amenity we could have desired.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe rooms were arranged well for our family of 5.  the two children\\'s rooms at the front of the house are separated by pocket doors so can be opened up for play time but closed for privacy.  the living room was comfortable and electronics worked fine.  it was great to have such a large kitchen and plenty of cookware, dishware, utensils, etc.  dining room seated 8 comfortably when we had guests for dinner.  the little deck off the \"guest\" bedroom was a favorite spot for lounging and reading.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe were surprised by the neighborhood, being more familiar with the mission of 20 years ago.  there are lots of trendy restaurants and shops around now.  the playgrounds and sports fields close by were definitely appreciated.  easy enough to access public transport.  narrow street for driving but that should be expected in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is a family home (very nice but nothing too fancy...which we prefer!) and worked out just wonderfully for our crew.the place was excellent. very clean and the location was great. it was very nice to have the space for our family. our host was very accommodating.truly beautiful home in a very fun and hip neighborhood. walking distance from a slew of restaurants and fun places to hang out. this was a fabulous experience.  we had a total of 6 staying in the mission dolores house (2 couples and 2 sinlges), so the bed situation worked out perfectly.  the house is gorgeous and very comfortable.  we were mostly out during the day, but when we were back at the house we felt like being in a cool vacation home.  \\r\\n\\r\\nit was so nice to be staying in an actual \"happening\" area, as opposed to being in some hotel in union square or the financial district.  joanne\\'s kitchen had plenty room for us to store food and groceries, as opposed to eating out every single time.  although, there are plenty of great restaurants, bakeries and the delicious bi-rite ice cream all within walking distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nparking around the area was also not bad (at least on the weekends).  we were able to find street parking just a few blocks from the house and left our car there all weekend. \\r\\n\\r\\njoanne was also very accommodating for our check-in and check-out times.  she was a wonderful host and i would highly recommend her and this beautiful home any time! the owner was very nice and gave us a lot of good information on things to see and do while in san francisco. the house is comfortable and charming and it is in a great location. close to very good restaurants, shops and bars. we walked everywhere because we enjoy walking and getting the flavor of the neighborhood and surrounding areas which were fabulous. delores park cafe was a favorite place to get breakfast. we would stay there again.we had a wonderful stay.  there were plenty of towels and supplies.  joanne did everything she could to make us feel welcome and was accomodating to our requests.  the location cannot be beat.this was our second time booking with joanne and we\\'d definitely come back again if we could. communication, check-in, check-out and the place were all perfect. the location is amazing as well. \\r\\n\\r\\ndefinitely recommend. great location and lovely home! especially enjoyed the top floor balcony/terrace! joanne responded quickly and check in & out went really smooth. would definitely stay here again!this is a great house in a perfect location. joanne is super accommodating and responsive. highly recommend.i came 3 weeks ago and hopefully will be staying at this amazing place for some time. here you get a real family, with all the care, support and delicious dinners together. lulu is really a unique personality, very creative, energetic, highly intelligent, bringing love to any tiny thing around her. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is big, green and nicely decorated. rooms are very comfortable and have their own character. this is truly international house where you can meet people from around the world and make friends, but you don’t feel like its crowded, you have enough of your personal space. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is just amazing – beautiful, safe and sound. although it’s quite far from downtown, you can easily get there in 20 min by muni metro, which is in 10 min walking distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nstaying with lulu will bring you one of most admirable experiences in your life.this is an incredible house in a fabulous neighborhood. i decided to extend my stay here and silvana did everything possible to accomodate me the best way. she is always ready to help and willing to find the best solution.\\r\\nso i switched several rooms and each of them is beautiful, very comfortable, clean and has a unique character. every evening people staying in the house get together for a dinner, so it really feels like being at home with a family. it\\'s truly remarkable experience and i highly recommend staying at silvana\\'s house!thanks to our hosts, we felt very comfortable. indeed, they left for us a couple of things in the fridge and it helped us feel like being home. the recommendations and rules to follow were clearly described. it also included useful and pleasant informations about the city and the neighborhood. talking about that, it was a very nice one. only a couple streets away, we found (thanks to our host\\'s recommendation) a very nice and living place with different restaurants and coffee shops. \\r\\nabout the house, it was absolutly gorgeous. it was spacious and pleasant. we found there, thanks to our hosts, a lot of free space to put our things. also, the view was breath taking. this was our first time using airbnb, and what a place to choose! i think we\\'ve been spoiled for the future. :) our group of 5 had a wonderful time staying in this home. it was  bright, sunny, and very welcoming, which was exactly what we were looking for. jee and paul left us great instructions for taking care of the house. they also left some chocolate for us -- so great for a quick treat during our stay. we spent some time lounging and reading in the courtyard area and enjoying the california weather. i will be thinking about that spot when it\\'s winter here in minnesota!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is a perfect jumping off point to get around san francisco. at the bottom of the hill are cute places for breakfast and lunch, as well as a really good coffee place (bello coffee). \\r\\n\\r\\nit was a great getaway, made even better by the comfortable and beautiful home we stayed in. thank you, jee and paul!\\r\\njee was such a gracious host, leaving us chocolates and beer and wine. it was very much appreciated that she left detailed rules and instructions for the house, including recommendations for restaurants and parks. the house was amazing and even better in person.  we would gladly stay here again if get the chance to return to the city. nice location randy is the best type of host: interested in making sure all of the details are perfect. he is also a great communicator, making the trip planning and logistics incredibly easy. his home is extraordinary. the view is tremendous and the house has everything you\\'ll need for your stay from rain shower/body sprays to premium cable to hot tub to wifi. i love to cook and i appreciated the top of the line appliances and cookware in the bright airy kitchen which had all the essentials. we really felt at home and comfortable during our stay. truly a five star experience to which even my very picky husband gave five stars.randy was a wonderful host for our group! he was so communicative before our stay and was available for anything that came up during.  his listing is stunning, with incredible views of downtown and the bay, and a great outdoor area as well.  this listing is also close to the best restaurants in town. i recommend it to anyone looking for stunning views and access to great nightlife and a true san francisco experience! i chose randy\\'s home for a team offsite event. it was absolutely perfect. the view was spectacular, and really brought the \"wow\" factor. randy and his fiance were polite, prompt, and helpful during booking and while we were there. definitely recommend. once again, randy\\'s spot did not disappoint!  we had a great group gathering over 2 days here and it was amazing. the views really instill a sense of peace, but also inspiration to do bigger and better things!\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks, randy!the views are truly amazing (i miss them already...). overall the house is a great use of space and wonderfully done. i would definitely recommend it. randy is always just a text or phone call away - he providing some great suggestions of nearby dining/drinking options as well. i wish i could attach photos to my review :)  sunsets from this home are amazing.  once again, randy was super communicative and our offsite time was productive and inspiring.pleasure as always!

we hosted a dinner at the space and everyone was blown away by the amazing views, gorgeous backyard complete with a fire pit and hot tub, and modern interior. we had the easiest time communicating with randy to make sure we had everything we needed - such an easy and enjoyable experience. this house is sooooo great!

(this is not a problem specific to this home and is common in homes in sf in general, but it is something to be aware of.)\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this house is in a great location with fantastic views and randy is the type of host who makes the experience hassle-free.  the neighbors who live downstairs are also very nice and pleasant people - even when faced with the noise caused by my kids.randy was very accommodating, he helped us out with a somewhat unusual booking and checked in via text to make sure we got in ok and that everything was going well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is amazing, quite beautiful, the beds very comfortable! we appreciate our stay and would love to come back here again!wow! we can\\'t say enough about this wonderful stay.  randy was very easy to communicate with and we felt he was always available. his home is amazing; the views are so spectacular and the entire home so lovely - we couldn\\'t wait to get back after our excursions everyday.  the neighborhood is very charming and cool with great restaurants, shops nearby -and we even played tennis in delores park.  our only, \"heads up\" is this is located on quite a steep hill in addition to the steps to the condo...great exercise and absolutely worth it to have those views!  the patio in the back was so very san francisco too, we sketched, wrote and just enjoyed hanging out there. we loved everything about it - felt like our luxurious sf home for the week.fantastic apartment. beautiful views. and randy provided excellent advice about which wineries to visit in napa -- highly recommend.randy\\'s place was exquisite. the layout of the home is ideal for someone looking to relax & have a good time. i was in town with co workers and we stayed here for a week. very accommodating and very helpful. would most definitely stay here again! \\nrandy couldn\\'t have been a better host.\\r\\nhe was there to greet me and go through the features of his amazing home as well as provide recommendations for dining.  \\r\\nit truly was a wonderful experience renting from randy.\\r\\nnot only the view of the apartment is great, the place and of course randy as our host is a super guy! before we came he gave lots of info about the house, the neighborhood and things that are going on in sf.\\r\\nthe apartment has the best view of the city and is a modern 4 people+ place. two great bedrooms and an extra place for another 2 people.\\r\\nnext time we sure will go back!!!this house was in a prime location...you could see the entire downtown, the park, and the mission. got the rare opportunity of meeting randy and his wife (both are delightful) and they were extremely accommodating.  the house & amenities were great.  i will definitely consider staying here again. randy was a fantastic host! he made sure i felt welcome and was able to find everything. the space was spotless. thanks for a fantastic stay! i booked for business and will definitely do so again. randy\\'s space was absolutely amazing and he was easy to communicate with. i highly recommend this listing!randy\\'s place was pretty much just as pictured - huge, modern and with amazing views! we stayed with 4 people here, and found that we each had a lot of space to ourselves. the location is incredible, although it is on the top a giant hill - but that makes for a great workout :) otherwise very close to restaurants, shops, etc. while the place was really great - it was not particularly home-y, so if that\\'s what you\\'re in the mood for, this place is more like a hotel.great location, beautiful house and comfortable settings. we loved staying at randy\\'s house and would return. randy was easy to communicate with. we has an excellent experience working with randy. he was very responsive. the space was fantastic and exactly as described. we did not spend much time in the neighborhood, but access to downtown was very easy via the j muni or taxi/uber (approx. 15 minutes to union square).randy was a perfect host! his apartment is gorgeous with beautiful views of san francisco in an amazing location. i highly recommend this listing. great experience at randy\\'s place! beautiful view of the city (dolores park) from this spacious apartment. the place has everything you need. short walk to convenience stores and the muni.\\r\\n\\r\\nrecommended!we had a wonderful time staying at randy\\'s home. the apartment is beautiful, the views spectacular, and the location great (very near lovely dolores park). the host, randy, was very communicative and very welcoming. we would definitely stay here again.a tremendous house in the most picturesque spot. it\\'s a shame sf is such a great town because after you arrive at randy\\'s place you\\'ll never want to leave. comfortable beds, lots of space, all the amenities that you\\'ll need, totally walkable (if you can handle the classic sf inclines!). we\\'ll be back the next time we\\'re in the city. our stay with randy was perfect! the home is gorgeous, and the view and location can\\'t be beat. he was very easy to reach throughout the whole trip and made our stay a breeze. randy\\'s place is amazing. the views are spectacular and location is perfect. randy was a great host and made the experience easy and comfortable. great place and great hosts! thank you for this nice stay, ben. we especially enjoyed the very nice view on sfo...we had a terrific stay in ben and vivian\\'s lovely house on elsie street. the view from the deck was amazing, the house was perfect for our family of 5, and the location was great for getting everywhere in san francisco we were going. the amenities in the house, including all the appliances, were very up to date. it\\'s also such a nice neighborhood. we ended up chatting with several of ben and vivian\\'s neighbors and that made it feel \"like home\" while we were there. what an amazing view!  it\\'s like the city is laid out below for you to gaze upon.  gorgeous.  the home is multi-level (5 fights of stairs throughout house, 1 additional in backyard if you\\'ve brought a furry-friend with you), so may not be best for those with knee or hip issues, but is definitely okay for families as each level is fully-secured with baby gates.  the kitchen is a cook/chef\\'s dream with all things you could possibly want/need (french press, vita mix, range of cooking oils and seasonings…) and makes for a great entertaining space.  music hookups so you can listen to your jams while perusing through their wall of books - organized by color, no less!  3 bedrooms with beds that feel like clouds to sleep on and bathrooms so everyone can get ready or have their private time, if needed.  garage space was a real treat to have in the city (may be challenging for those not familiar with sf inclines or snug garages) and easily fit our ford explorer.  we did bring our dog and were delighted by all there was to do with him.  bernal heights tower and open space gave him room to run and play with other dogs; iron + gold bar down the street welcomed him with a fresh bowl of water and treats while we sipped on their tasty cocktails (a bit loud in front, the back was more conducive to conversation).  overall, what a fantastic place to stay.  we will definitely be back.  thank you for your hospitality, ben!  the pictures and description of ben\\'s home do not do it justice. it made our holiday! wonderful views of san francisco from the porch, an amazing full kitchen that is great for preparing meals and incredibly comfortable beds. the house is 4 floors, so there is plenty of room to explore and great for a large family. ben stayed in contact before, during and after to ensure everything went smoothly. ben and vivian were easy to work with.  we were very comfortable in their home. they made room in their closet for us.  the beds were very comfortable. they had all high end features\\r\\nand we enjoyed the vitamix. the noe valley view is great to look at.\\r\\nthe parking space was such a life saver as we did have a car.  we enjoyed the neighborhood grocery stores for organic foods. they had tons of toys and baby equipment for our 10 month granddaughter to enjoy. the only surprise was the 3 full flights of stairs in the home and no cable tv.  we adjusted and had a very lovely stay.we stayed for 14 nights at ben and vivian\\'s house. it\\'s a beautiful place, very convenient for a family of 6. we found the kitchen highly equipped, more than enough sheets & towels, very clean and well kept, and overall very comfortable. the location is excellent: great view, easy to access both to the city and to the south bay, and quite close to public transportation. overall, highly recommended!great family thanksgiving! there was plenty of space for all and a terrific kitchen to cook in. only let downs: fireplace was inoperable, no foosball table, no access to back patio/garden, no bed but mattress on floor in one room, children\\'s toys everywhere. big pluses: fully loaded kitchen (we made dinner for 7ppl), big dining table, privacy, multiple bathrooms, great location/neighborhood, and gracious hosts. we recommend staying here.my stay was so comfortable and relaxing. the view is stunning! the kitchen is perfectly stocked with a great dining table and a cozy living room with a small balcony. i had my family of 4 stay the duration and had about 10 people total for christmas dinner and everything went smoothly. the beds are super comfy and bathrooms clean and modern. we found having a car necessary in this neighborhood since it can be a bit of a walk to surrounding neighborhoods but the one car garage made it easy. the host was very attentive & gracious. oh and everything in the house is labeled and super organized. the perfect home away from home! this is a lovely home, exactly as described.  the location is great, the views are beautiful, and there are grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance.  ben is a very gracious host, very flexible and accommodating without being intrusive.  we had a wonderful stay. i have no hesitation in recommending this listing.the reservation was canceled 13 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we had a wonderful stay at this well maintained and amazingly equipped home. breathtaking view from the living room area and this property also has a lovely garden with blackberry bush and other fruit trees. a perfect place to stay for a family with toddler/infant. parking was not an issue for both of our cars which is hard to believe in sf.host was excellent and very helpful for our first airbnb experience. house was awesome, views and kitchen were terrific. ample room for three couples and a child.  loved having coffee on the pario with the stunning view of noe valley and the city. kitchen worked perfect for dinners and breakfasts.  neighborhood was quiet and had lots of conveniences. great experience.ben\\'s house is really pretty and beautiful. it\\'s the perfect spot for families and it has all needed for little kids, which is really helpful. \\nthe communication with ben was always good and he answered to all our needs. he even gave us the chance to 3 of us of staying one more night than planned.\\nthe rules are perfectly defined and everything is clear. \\none tiny thing, it\\'s a house with four levels and steep stairs, so if you\\'re coming with elderly people you will need to give them the main room (closest to the entrance) but if you\\'re a party of young people there won\\'t be any trouble. \\nwe were 8 people and everybody loved this house. totally recommend it! ben\\'s home is beautiful. the home is as described and the views from the living room and kitchen are beautiful. kitchen is full equipped and very specious. we nejoyed dinner with 5 people and more are possible within any problems. garage is specious as well. \\r\\nlocation in bernal heights is almost perfect. you enjoy many restaurants and bars just 5 min. away and you can ride into central san francisco conveniently by tram. we loved the placed and will definetely book it again.had a great stay at ben\\'s home with my extended family of 6 people. so much to love about the place: modern design/build, beautiful views of the city, fully stocked kitchen, good size bedrooms that offer nice privacy, everything you need for a young child, garage parking, and more. and ben was an incredibly helpful and accessible host. the only things that other renters should consider is that there are a lot of stairs (the home is spread over 5 floors) and that the neighborhood itself is very hilly, making it a little difficult to walk places with a stroller. that being said, i have no reservations recommending this house and would love to stay again if back in sf. look no further -- this is the airbnb you want to stay in! it is an absolutely beautiful home with stunning views and a great location. we felt very welcome and at ease and liked it so much we extended our stay for several days. ben was a great host - very responsive to anything we needed. would highly recommend this home to anyone! charming house we booked when on business in san francisco. we were welcomed and the host was very responsive. the property is modern, and the view from the balcony is beautiful. there are many hip restaurants just down the hill on mission st. all together we were very pleased.my friends and i visited san francisco for spring break. we have seven of us. ben provided clear instructions on checking in and accessing the house. because we have no kids/children, we were initially a bit reluctant about booking as the place is labeled a \\'family home\\', but everything turned out great! ben was very prompt in his reply and was very responsive. his home is beautiful, the bookshelf in particular is just stunning (the english major in me was very happy). fantastic views of san francisco from the porch as well. would love to come back here again. thank you, ben!the host responded to things right away. the house is great with a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms. it\\'s clean and modern. you can tell it\\'s a loved house. the only down side is there are a lot of stairs but that goes with the territory of san fran. amazing house :)ben was fantastic right from the first inquiry - despite being on the other side of the pacific ocean!  the house was better than advertised and suited our crew really well.  we weren\\'t looking to commute into downtown so the location worked well for us.  the views are astounding, the kitchen is generously stocked, and the livingroom is really welcoming.  the garage is a huge bonus as street parking is a bit of a challenge - to say the least!  definitely recommend the house and the hosts.it is a great and beautiful place in great neighborhood!we rented this lovely home for a week for our parents and family members who were in town for our wedding. the house fit our group of 7 adults and 3 kids very comfortably. it was just what we were looking for. the house was spacious, and the views were incredible. it looked just like the pictures and the whole family felt at home straight away. the different levels provided plenty of privacy for different groups of people. our family had little kids with different sleep hours and the rooms were far apart from each other. the living and dining room created a wonderful space for dining and socializing. \\r\\n\\r\\nben was super communicative and responsive throughout the whole experience, so thank you so much!everything went smoothly. i would come back 5/5!our host ben was very accommodating and helpful.we really appreciated his flexibility about needing to check in early. ben was very easy to communicate with and he made sure we knew about the housekeeper\\'s and gardner\\'s schedules. ben and vivian\\'s home was the perfect place for our stay. we had little one\\'s with us so the crib and child friendly home made our stay away from home super comfortable. we loved the house and fabulous book collection!ben\\'s home was amazing and just as described. check-in was a breeze and ben responded promptly to all of our questions/needs. the bedrooms and living spaces were roomy, and very clean. every night my family and i would stand on the balcony and watch as the fog rolled in, it was absolutely breathtaking. the lemon trees were producing while we were there and we really enjoyed them. \\r\\nwe had two cars and even though the home only comes with one space (in the garage), street parking was not hard to come by. \\r\\nthe home is spread out over many levels, and there are lots of stairs, so do keep that in mind when booking this bnb. ben provides toiletries and plenty of towels for those who need them. we did expect however, based on ben\\'s description of the kitchen, that there would be plenty of spices in the pantry for us to use, but there was only salt, pepper, and oil. it made it difficult to cook meals without having to go out and buy extra spices. not a big deal for those who plan to eat out, but something to keep in mind. \\r\\noverall the house and location were perfect for our needs (we were a large party), with plenty to do in the area and lots of delivery places. i would stay here again in a heartbeat. cindi is an amazing person, she really cares about the people staying in her house if you need something you just need to ask and she’ll do her best to help you out. also the house is in a really secure area and close to a lot of tourist places. if you need something to eat or a place to hangout at night chestnut street is nearby,there is quite a few cool bars and restaurants. i’ll totally stay with cindi in my next trip to sfo she is like family now and after being in her house i just can’t stay in a hotel it was truly amazing :)cindi & chris were the perfect hosts, so open and relaxed you couldn\\'t ask for more.\\r\\nthe house is in a fantastic location close to the water and many of the attractions of san francisco are within walking distance. unbeknownst to me fleet week was on and i spent the last afternoon on the roof with chris watching the jets fly over, what a fantastic sight. \\r\\ni would highly recommend staying in this house to anyone who needs a great place to stay in san fran and wants a friendly local experience instead of the run of the mill experience hotels seem to offer. last but not least take cindi\\'s advice and order food from the local deli.\\r\\n\\r\\ncheers matt\\r\\nps: if i found myself in town again, i would not hesitate to stay again.was in town for a conference so was not at the place a lot. wonderful location. can walk to everything. cindi left a great welcome basket. clean sheets and towels. the host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.awesome place, awesome location.  would definitely stay there again.the host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.katie is a very kind, friendly and an amazing hostess. she instantly made us feel welcome and helped us get settled in right away. it was our first airbnb experience and was just great!

thanks for hosting us, kirsten!the host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.kevin was an amazing host! he was very responsive to emails and accommodating for our stay.  the house was lovely and newly remodeled.  i would definitely recommend this house and will book with kevin again when we are in the san francisco area.\\r\\n\\r\\nkevin\\'s place is exactly as pictured but even (url hidden) was very clean and comfortable.the place was really well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. i will definitely stay here again.kevin was very attentive, gave me very prompt answers and negotiations were really easy and reasonable. i had to arrive earlier (only me without my other 3 friends) and he was really quick in adjusting the dates and giving a very good discount on the first night, as expected of a very well intentioned host.\\r\\napartment is spacious, clean, comfortable. i was sorry i did not see curtains on windows, but that did not become a problem during stay. although the host does not live in the apartment (i like staying in places where people actually live but it is just my taste), it is well equipped (except lack of washing machine). wifi was not working very well in all rooms but kevin quickly helped me with buying a wifi extender, so we had no issues after that. all 4 rooms are similar in size and decoration, good for groups. bed is great, the linens and blankets are really warm/cozy and new, we can see the host is worried about guest\\'s stay. towels, shampoos, toothpaste and even make up removals! 5 stars!\\r\\nthe neighborhood is fine, close to parks and golden gate, really beautiful and convenient, there are some restaurants and bars at walking distance. 25-30 minutes in a car to downtown though, but it was ok for us. apartment has privacy. i felt it was a little bit impersonal, there is no tv set, some furniture is missing (a table in living room or more chairs/couches for people to sit and hang out). closets did not have drawers or shelves but i assume most airbnbs have restrictions on that, some don\\'t even offer a closet at all, due to logistics, so i guess it\\'s fine too.\\r\\nin short, i am definitely approving the place and the host and i think you would be very fine renting it.i am really very happy that we chose this location for our first air bnb.  kevin was a wonderful host the minute we made contact.  he kindly met me at the apartment for a requested early check in and was available for any questions for the entire weekend we were there.  this was perfect to host a get together for our family and close friends who are attending our daughter\\'s wedding on maui.  the house was clean and ready for us to start our weekend when we checked in.  beds were comfortable.  space was wonderful.  just loved it.  very close in walking distance our excellent restaurants of all cultures.  i would stay here again.  thank you kevin.awesome stay exactly as advertised great location very quiet!great location and a very clean place.  we had a hiccup in the checking in process as kevin and i had originally agreed for my family and myself to check in at 12pm and he texts me at 10:20am on the day of check in to say that we cannot check in now until about 3pm.  my family and i were already on our way to sf.  he stated that there was a last minute booking, which is fine-it happens, i totally understand but he could not have told us the night before? or as soon as that person booked and he accepted their request? this was highly inconvenient as i was coordinating and planning with 10 people that were to stay at the airbnb.\\r\\n\\r\\nthat being said, the apt itself is very well maintained.  be aware though that this is bare essentials. there are no drapes on any of the windows, no microwave, and very few pots and pans if you plan to cook.  \\r\\n\\r\\nother than that, check in was easy of getting in to the apt and obtaining keys and check out was just leaving the keys on the table and locking the doors behind us. \\r\\n\\r\\noh, also- my family and i did not mind because we were also up late but the downstairs neighbors were having a party and playing music pretty loudly.  so if you are sensitive to noise, you should probably take note. \\r\\n\\r\\nkevin\\'s home was perfect for our family vacation! it\\'s in pristine condition, with plenty of space for everyone to feel comfortable. kevin was flexible and accommodating and really made us feel at home. would definitely recommend it for anyone traveling to san francisco with their family. kevin\\'s house was absolutely fantastic.  fresh towels, the beds were amazing and he was a great host.  would stay there again the next time i\\'m in town. kevin place is really nice! very big house for our 5 person stay... i love the tidy and cleanliness! .. we have a pleasant stay in the house .. highly recommended! .. definitely will come back again!kevin was a great host, with good communication and flexibility with check in and checkout. the property was great for 8 people, but not sure how it would sleep the full 12 it advertises. there were no curtains or blinds on any of the windows, which made it hard to sleep in, and the kitchen wasn\\'t outfitted very well in terms of pots/pans/dishes for 8 people. wifi was available, but was very slow. overall it was a comfortable stay in a great neighbourhood. kevin was very quick to respond to the request and very helpful with all of the questions i had. the house is beautiful and the layout was perfect for our group. everyone there was impressed and enjoyed every moment of our time there. would stay there again if the need arises again. kevin was super nice throughout our entire stay. he checked in with us multiple times to make sure our trip was going well and was always available to answer questions. his home was very nice and clean, and we had a lovely time staying there. it had all the amenities we needed and the beds were very comfortable! the location was also great; it is right next to chinatown, so we were right next to a few great asian restaurants.my experience was great. the listing was just as expected upon arrival. needed a place to stay for a friend\\'s bachelor party and kevin\\'s house was the perfect place for it. we all had a blast. kevin even provided slippers for our entire group of 11 guys. would definitely recommend staying here. worth every penny. thanks kevin!this apt is very nice and kevin is also a nice person, always reply me in first time! there has four rooms with comfortable queen size beds. the kitchen and bedroom are clean! the location of apt is very close to the golden state bridge! i love it!excelent house/appartment and fantastic hospitality from kevin...when we will plan trip tou san francisco we will use only at these appartments... kevin is fantastic!

it was clean and had everything we needed. kevin was kind and quick to respond to all of my questions. i actually had almost no questions because he was detailed on the day of checking in. i would recommend kevin anytime!kevin was a great host! \\nthe house was really clean, and exactly as advertised. thanks, kevin! we really appreciated your hospitality we stayed at kevins place with a couple of colleagues. good beds, newly renovated. nice place to stay. much better than any hotel to stay with a couple of colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring our stay we had a small problem with one of the smoke detectors. our host reacted promptly, and solved the problem to our satisfaction.kevin was a good host. his response was unbelievable fast! he is very reliable and sweet. the house was fairly clean. my family and i did not have any complaints at all. i would recommend this space to anyone else looking for a place to stay in san francisco.kevin was a great host and he had a lovely and clean place in sf.  i would definitely rent from him again!kevin\\'s response was very quick. house was nice and clean. very comfortable. auri was a brilliant host - attentive, responsive, and extremely friendly. her husband also made me feel very welcome, showing me around to the best spots in the neighborhood! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft is very well decorated, spacious and sunny; the bedroom is a private space on the main floor, attached to a bathroom. great location; wonderful hosts; clean and sunny sexiest stay ever. definitely worth it.the host canceled this reservation 111 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.fine stay in this listing. had a hard time communicating with the host as he was unresponsive. the house was beautiful and everything we expected, enjoyed the hot tub as well! fran was great help finding parks in the area too!wonderful views and tastefully decorated.  i\\'d recommend the house for anyone interested in staying on the east side of the city.several colleagues and i rented this house for a work trip and loved coming home each day to this house.  the house is very comfortable with great conversation areas inside and outside, great style and art pieces, amazing views of the city from every room (seriously!) and overall just a great place to come home to when on the road.  far better than any hotel we could have rented... and the rental was priced just right, too.  we loved the time spent in fran\\'s gracious home. the views are spectacular, and there was plenty of space for my 2-year-old twins. the location was quite convenient to moscone center, where my conference was, and we enjoyed the local tot lot too. thanks, fran!it was great staying at fran\\'s lovely home!  the house itself is beautiful. we had three couples staying there and each bedroom was amazing with it\\'s own special bonus, either a great view or a deck or a walkway into the garden. after spending the day in the city it was great to come home to the jaccuzi and relax with friends and family.  you are lucky if you get to stay in this amazing home.it was a lovely, clean, house in a terrific area. it was everything as advertized. thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay again without hesitation.this was a great house. myself and 3 coworkers stayed here for a week while in town for a conference at the moscone center. we were more than comfortable with the space and amenities. there were inviting patios all over this house to enjoy the amazing views of the city. this was way better than a hotel (and it ended up saving us money too). the cab ride to the moscone center was about $10 - we probably could have walked but the area between the house and the center seemed a little sketchy. the neighborhood the house was in seemed nice though and i walked down to the nearby whole foods and the little neighborhood grocery during our stay - no problem! also never had a problem finding a spot on the street for our rental car. i\\'d highly recommend this place.amazing location and accommodations. fran was highly communicative and wanted to ensure that we had an enjoyable stay. fantastic location, we will stay here again if afforded the opportunity. thanks fran!unforgettable experience. a lot of natural light and very spacious. great view from the apartment. conveniently located near a whole foods and a deli.  quiet neighborhood. this was my second time at fran\\'s place and first time in the entire listing. it was fantastic. the views are amazing, the neighborhood is great and the listing was clean upon arrival. fran\\'s door has a code, which completely eliminates key stress when you are with a big group. communicating with fran is incredibly easy. she responds to airbnb messages nearly in real time. i would highly recommend staying at her place. fran\\'s home is so wonderful.\\neverything is perfect\\ni spent a great time with 4 friends there.\\nwe hope to stay at her house at our next trip to san francisco!!

highly recommended!!this place is super nice, comfortable, clean.  like seriously clean.  i love it.  the location is great too.  on most days i\\'d walk to the glen park bart station, which is about a 10 minutes\\' walk away.  convenient bus stops are much closer than that.  other than that, pak is a really cool and nice guy; his girlfriend is great too.  he was very friendly and helpful in telling me places to check out in the area.  no problems or issues whatsoever.  highly recommended.pk was extremely accommodating. i had to arrive around 1pm and he came and met me so i could put my stuff away before my meetings. i used the garage, so i felt good about leaving some of my gear in the car. place was very very clean. only thing to know is that the mattress is a tempurpedic. i never slept on one, but i slept well both nights. i had the pleasure of spending 5 nights at pk\\'s home and i will definitely go back when i need somewhere to stay in sf. pk is very welcoming and has everything you need all set up and ready to go. his home is very clean and tidy which makes it a very nice place to stay, cleaner than any hotel you will come across. if you are in need of a place to stay make sure you stay here, you will not regret it. \\r\\nso i stayed from aug 6-9  and it was fantastic. him and his girlfriend were more than accommodating.  the room was large enough to put all our stuff in and the apartment itself is close to the train and several bus lines. also, there is a great japanese restaurant under the apartment where both the staff and patrons are nice. pk even gave my friend and i a ride to the golden gate bridge; hospitality overall is what i can say about this pk. overall a fantastic stay and would stay here again when i return to san fran. pk and his girlfriend were such a pleasure to stay with. extremely hospitable and very friendly. their place was clean and they even gave us some good restaurant tips and advice about getting around town. i would recommend them for anyone looking for a solid place to stay while in san francisco.\\r\\npk and his girlfriend kikki were very hospitable. pk wasn\\'t there when i first arrived, but his girlfriend was available to let me in. he was very responsive via text and alerted me that she would be at the place when i arrived. when i did get the chance to meet pk, he was very helpful with information about how to get around the city, where to park and where the best places to eat are located. the room was very clean and comfortable, there were even fresh, clean towels set out on the bed. their place is very nice and modern i was welcomed like family! the bathroom was very clean and has an amazing double head shower. seriously. that shower was, like the best thing to ever happen to me. they were even kind enough to cook me an authentic thai meal. i also got the chance to watch some tv on their awesome 66\" television. \\r\\n\\r\\ncons: parking can be a little tricky in the area. you\\'ll need to really pay attention to the signs and it gets harder to find parking after 5pm. the area is a little sketchy, so i wouldn\\'t recommend walking around too much alone or after dark. other than that, if i were in the area, i\\'d definitely stay again! this place was amazing to stay in also the host pk was great. the location was great just a few minutes from where i was working . will defo come back again. thank you for all your help.i had a nice time staying with pk, his lovely wife, and roommate steve.  pk was very helpful.  helping me with my luggage and the best way to travel during rush hour traffic. very warm and lovely folks to stay with.  i also paid extra to use the garage parking, was nice to not have to look for parking after a long day at work.  the room was next to the street and pk provides plenty of earplugs.  they worked great!

(he offered me earplugs.)  the bathroom was clean, and the shower excellent.  i did not take advantage of the kitchen, but it looked very modern and clean.where do i begin?  this was my first abnb experience and i truly hope they all are at this experience if not, higher (which is tough to achieve). pk and kiki were amazing hosts.  from the moment i walked in the door, i was offered refreshments and encouraged to take a seat and relax (mind you i\\'m 5 mos. pregnant).  the rest of the evening was bliss.  i was truly in a clean, tidy, and relaxed environment.  my room had was clean, bed was nice and comfortable.  i had a tv in mine but i never got to use it as i enjoyed the huge flat panel in the living room.  ladies, the bathroom? details were dialed in.  qtips, blowdryer, shampoo and conditioner if you use it.  i am a bathroom freak, so the bathroom was clean, as in white bleach clean- no complaints.  i am also a light sleeper and had the room that was in the front of the house.  i was generously offered earplugs in case i needed them, but i travel with them (which i used) and i slept like a baby.  overall, i have zero complaints about this unit and hosts.  transportation is right outside, and you really can\\'t beat the price.  i want cleanliness, no fear of walking around barefoot, and great hosts.  i got it all and i wish i would\\'ve stayed for more than 1 night.  thank you both!  i wish you the best in your endeavors :)good location. it\\'s convenient to go to downtown by bus. nice host. they introduced a lot of interesting places to visit in sf. his wife even helped us to wash our dirty plates. happy experience.our staying at pk and kiki\\'s home was very homey, it felt as if we had already met somewhere! right from the start both were very helpful and always available in providing us with any information - from sightseeing spots to laundry services! sharing breakfast in the morning was a pleasant experience during which we could share each other\\'s tales and funny stories. the room was very comfortable, noiseless and  immaculate clean...and we slept like bears! the house was also conveniently located close to public transportation. all in all we highly recommend it to anybody visiting san francisco and wishing to meet a delightful couple!pk and his wife are very gracious hosts. they made sure i was  as comfortable as possible during my stay. the bedroom was nicely decorated, clean, with a very comfortable bed. i felt at home in their nice flat. they took the time to get to know me and i enjoyed hanging out with them. ok gave me the inside scoop on public transportation and things to do and see in the city. i would recommend these hosts to all travelers.pk and piki were awesome hosts, the room and the bathroom is very nice and very clean. pk and piki offered coffee/tea and pastries in the mornings and even let me enjoy their dinner with them. excellent thai cuisine. the apartment is right in front of a bus station that brings you right into mission district and city center (e.g. 4th & mission), bart is maybe 5-10 min walk away. really convenient. next door also some places you can grab dinner and a late night store you can grab water or wine etc. pk was a great host. very helpful with travel suggestions. clean apartment and a very nice host.pk and kiki were very hospitable hosts. pk was very prompt in responding  to and disputing any of my questions and concerns. he was even able to accommodate an earlier check-in time. \\r\\ntheir apartment is very nice, clean, and spacious. the bedroom is of adequate size and has a comfortable bed. the only thing that may be of concern is that the room is located on the side that the street lies, and therefore can be a little noisy when cars and buses drive by. i did not have too much of a problem with this but it could be a problem to some. the bathroom is super clean, equipped with all your needs, and a shower i wish i had in my own home. \\r\\ndon\\'t be fooled by the neighborhood, it may seem a little run down but pk\\'s apartment is the nicest and newest on the block. i felt safe while staying in his home. parking was not too bad, but can be a little troublesome, especially if you are coming home late. you have to pay close attention to the street and parking signs. the apartment is located no farther than 25 minutes from anywhere in san francisco, with easy access to freeways and public transit. \\r\\noverall, pk and kiki were very friendly and helpful. they were respectful of our privacy and made us feel welcome in their home. i recommend pk as a host to anyone staying in san francisco.\\r\\nthe apartment is very big and new, with great location. everything is good. pk is very hospitable. he patiently introduced about the city. i would definitely stay there again when i visit san francisco next time.the apartment was very nice and clean.  my friend and i had never been to san francisco before so we had heard negative things about the mission district in regards to safety, but the building is very safe and we never once felt uncomfortable as two young college girls.  additionally, pk was extremely nice and helpful.  he told us how to use the public transportation and was eager to answer all our questions.  we really enjoyed sitting and getting to know him after our long days.  i would definitely stay here again and our experience was very positive.  pk and his wife are very nice people and great hosts. we have enjoyed our staying with them in their cute apartment. they are very helpful, they gave us many information and tips and were still available for us. the room is very clean, comfortable bed with wardrobe and tv. the share living room is spacious, very comfortable, modern with huge home cinema. the location is good, safe and close to the city center by bart. thanks pk and hope to see with your wife in paris.pk was very nice and friendly about our stay. he was a little nosey about what we were planning on doing in san francisco and sometimes would not give us the space we wanted, however our overall experience still ended up good. pk made me feel very welcome. he helped me with  the logistics of my stay in sf. i had some scheduling issues come up, and he was very flexible and accommodating. the apartment looks just like you see it in the photos. i found it to very clean and very comfortable. i would definitely stay with pk again.my first experience was so good i came back for a second one - which was also superb!pk and his wife were very kind and helpful. it was very safe neighborhood close to public transit. i wish i would have asked his advice earlier because he was so helpful finding not just his home but other places around town. his suggestion to go the golden gate park and how to get to chinatown was a great help. we had very limited time in the city and this is a great location if you are driving or flying in from sfo airport. the place was very clean and well kept. the only minor drawback is if you are a light sleeper please take his suggestion and use the provided ear plugs if you are in the bedroom close to the street. everything is exactly as described in the listing. no surprises. =) the provided little extras like q-tips and brochures for the city were very nice. thank you for your hospitality. to be honest, not a great experience. our room was very noisy (from street traffic and living room tv) with very little privacy (it opens into the middle of the cooking/living space of the host family). we ate out, because use of the kitchen was frowned upon. there was a huge tv in the room, but no tv signal. host has lots of rules and regulations, but his directions were wrong (now corrected).pk and kiki are great hosts! even if we unfortunately did not have enough time to spend together - as my stay in sf was very short, it was very pleasant to stay in their super clean appartment. pk gave me recommendations on what to do in sf, which i really appreciated. thank u guys! both of you were very nice with me!  everything was great and as described in pk\\'s ad. he was very accommodating to an early check in, offered us coffee in the morning and everything was very clean. i would stay here again. pk and his wife were great host. i had no problems maintaining contact with them and he provided me with detailed directions getting to the apartment. we chatted about the area and he gave me some suggestions regarding restaurants and options to get around. room was clean and did have some noise since it\\'s right on mission street but that didn\\'t bother me. there are some earplugs and headphones for those that are sensitive sleepers.  i only stayed one night but overall, it was a great experience.i would wish to say that pk\\'s innate understand of what people needs are is uncanny.  any information i needed about how to get around san francisco was duly answered. there were subtle things that pk had in place for safety such as motion sensor lights between the space in the kitchen and the bathroom so that at night i could easily see my way into the apartment or go between the bedroom and the bathroom.  there are fire alarms/smoke detectors,too.  along with this the apartment was kept very clean.  pk likes the interchange  between people, and asks questions to get to know you.  in addition, he has a very nice sense of humor, and we laughed about some of life\\'s absurdities.  i didn\\'t feel that i was ever interfering in their lives and felt at home in their space.  it was a very good experience and one that i can easily recommend to anyone staying in san francisco.i booked this room late friday afternoon and had to cancel it later that same evening as my dog was bitten and i felt it important to stay with him over the weekend.i booked this room for my friend, he was enjoy the time in pk\\'s house, very convient and comfortable, there a lot of restaurants around, bus is just in front of the door, pk was a great host, friendly and helpful.\\r\\nthanks pk!pk and his wife were very welcoming. i was impressed at how quickly pk responded to my initial inquiry as well as follow-up questions. the apartment was easy to find with doorstep access to public transport to down town. i enjoyed the area the apartment was in itself and had dinner in a el salvadorian restaurent a short walk away from the apartment. everything was as described and could easily relax. this was my first airbnb experience which was very positive.i liked pk\\'s place! very cosy and comfortable room, nice spacious apartment, and pk is very hospitable. looking forward to return to san francisco and try to stay at his place.our two nights staying in pk’s place were pleasant.   the hosts were nice and the home was cleanpk was a great host. he has clean apartment with the  nice and cozy guest room. the bart is just in 10 minutes to walk, so it was very convenient place for me. nice place, great host! :)pk is a very thoughtful, friendly people. the room is super clean. the bed is very cozy. far better than the hotels. living here make me like live  a friend\\'s place. we can talk, understand each other. very good experience. i will recommend my friend choose your place to live when they travel to sf.pk made me feel welcomed the second i walked into his home. i can\\'t stress enough how genuine, welcoming and friendly him and his wife were. this has been the best airbnb experience i\\'ve had and i will recommend pk\\'s residence to anyone. the place is clean, quiet, has all the amenities one needs during their travels.\\r\\npk was very easy to communicate with and contact upon arrival. the room was clean and we enjoyed our several nights there. the bart is a 10min walk and was fine every day. we were also able to leave our car parked on the street no problem. it was a great experience.pk is a great host. the house is located in a very good neighbourhood of mission. a lot of restaurants of different cuisine are just across the street. the entire house is very clean and spacious. pk is very sensible guy and will be there to help you with all the information that you may need being a new guy in the city. i highly recommend his place for any airbnb guy looking for a place to live .this was my first time using airbnb and i was a little hesitant to be honest. however pk and kiki put my mind at ease with their generous hospitality. their home is as exactly as described. a clean, convenient respite with easy access to all sight seeing venues. pk and kiki were always available to offer \\'tour guide\\' type advice and allowed me to freely engage, quietly rest or slowly begin my day. i would definitely stay here again for my next visit to san francisco and look forward to exploring airbnb elsewhereoverchargedpk and kiki have built a wonderful apartment, which is as warm and hospitable as they are. my wife and i spent five days and pk spoonfed our transports and local supports. our room is very cute and comfortable and opens into a spacious living room. the bathroom is spacious and bigger than a hotel\\'s. they gave a european breakfast of yogurt and fruits and invited us to eat whatever else. kiki made some pork and rice one morning for pk and shared it with us. the place is in a lovely neighborhood that supports chinese, thai and mexican food. all good. the bus stop is 20 secs away. pk has sensor lights that come on at night when you visit the bathroom at night. they have a quiet house and extremely neat. we will surely repeat this experience should we need too. thanx pk and kiki. god bless!great host! i hosted a new employee at my startup at his place and he was totally satisfied. pk was very prompt and communicative throughout the booking and my arrival. he gave good local advice on how to get to his place and met me at the front door with a key, a smile and made me feel welcome. he then showed me my room and helped get me comfortable. the room is well-lit and on second story, with a large firm bed and small table with carefully arranged treats.  pk\\'s home is very clean and tidy and well appointed. i loved the variety of affordable local restaurants, all within walking distance.  due to work commitments, i was not home during the day and did not spend much time with pk after my initial arrival but i\\'d  recommend this place to others and would like to stay there again when i\\'m next in san francisco.pk and his wife are friendly and considerate. they gave me some good advice of living at san francisco. i enjoyed my stay at their place.  pk and his wife are both friendly, considerate and kind enough to offer every information i needed for my pleasant stay. their description on the webpage is quite accurate. the cleanliness as well as the fast response to your email cannot be better than their place! as for location, i found it pretty convenient and easy to access the downtown once i got used to taking the public transportation. once you find the house rule is fine to you, just send the request to pk :) highly recommend!!the hosts are friendly and helpful. they are fantastic and very caring. the listing is very good in a peaceful and calm neighbourhood. the room is cozy and has nice view of the road.i extended my stay for few weeks with pk as i felt very comfortable in their home.  pk has been very helpful and i will definitely book their listing the next time i visit sfo. pk is a very adviser for how to where and how to travel in sf.\\r\\nthe room is very clean and comfortable.\\r\\n15 minutes to airport,very convenient.the landlord is asian young man with special enthusiasm, but also the transportation is relatively convenient. he is doing his best to the landlord!pk and kiki are great hosts, going out of their way to make sure that you\\'re taken care of.pk made us feel very welcome and thoroughly explained where everything was located, and that they would be able to assist us in any way possible. if we needed anything, he ensured that we could simply just send him a text. nice place to stay. bernal marina home was a perfect home for the size family we had! everyone had a bedroom with their own bathrooms.  kid or adults could go to the basement to watch the tv without it being the center if attention. kitchen and dining room were a fabulous size for those who wanted and needed to cook and for those who wanted to eat. laundry facilities were on site and grocery stores or coffee shops were very near! highly recommended! we had a great weekend at marina. it\\'s awesome for a large party. carrie is a nice and considerate  host. highly recommend it.it is a very big and real 3 bed room house. very clean, comfortable, convenient close to bart station and freeway 280 and full of art! we really liked it here.carrie was indeed very helpful from the beginning. it was my first time to use this website and to find a place to stay for our san francisco trip. she responded very promptly through text and email, and was very helpful until the end of our stay. we loved the place and was very satisfied. we did not regret renting the house instead of staying at a hotel. the furniture and appliances are high quality, the house is very clean. it is very ideal for a large group. we\\'re a group of 10, 6 adults and 4 kids. the house could probably accommodate 2 more people since there is a sofa bed downstairs. we felt very comfortable and at times, we would just stay at the house to relax. there\\'s a lot of windows in the main area (living room, dining and kitchen) which gives plenty of light. it is very convenient because you\\'re able to cook food so you don\\'t have to eat out every time. the bart station is also about a 5-8 min walk which saves you from driving and pay for parking. san francisco airport it about 15 mins away when there\\'s no traffic. parking on the side of the house can fit up to 2 cars. we had a mini and a mid size suv. there is also a big size yard where the kids can play. would definitely recommend this and would like to stay here again for future visits.the house was lovely and very clean.  the keys are in a lock box outside so arrival can be any time.  once inside all the rooms are set up with clean sheets and the amenities are ready to go.  it was exactly what we needed after our long flight and i would definitely recommend this place.we had a great time in carrie\\'s wonderful house. it is really nice with lots of room for everyone. the freeway is very close but didn\\'t disturb much as we were out most of the day. we were there whilst attending a conference and if you are planning a work trip the only thing you should be aware of is that wifi only works in the lounge downstairs. the location is very convenient close to both the freeway and the bart. we would definitely go back if we needed a big place stay in sf! thanks carrie!the location of the house was great (5 minutes walking from the bart, close exit from the freeway). the traffic was a little loud from the freeway inside the house, but the bedrooms are all on the opposite side of the house so we were not affected at night by the noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house itself was spacious and parking was available, which for san francisco can be a challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nas soon as we arrived we had the feeling that the host was in a rush to exit the house. there was a dirty towel and baby bottle left sitting next to the kitchen sink. none of the toothbrushes were put away and also a dirty, used soap bar was sitting next to the bathroom sink.\\r\\n\\r\\ncarrie was very responsive to our questions. we asked for a hairdryer and she had one left at the front door for us when we returned for the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall a good experience, however attention to important details were left out.what a great hostess and what a great place.  carrie answered all of our questions ahead of time so we knew how to get downtown efficiently to get to our tours on time.  to get downtown we had an eight minute walk to the bart, then a 10 minute train ride for $1.85 each way - this was way better than trying to deal with traffic around town and/or parking and fees.  there was off street parking for our rental cars (a plus, since some hotels we looked into didn\\'t have parking or charged a lot for parking).  the home was upscale and very comfortable for us (three couples).  the home has three full bathrooms, which gave us additional privacy.  the kitchen was awesome with room for all of us to sit together in the beautiful dine in kitchen.  we had everything we needed and more.  we also could choose to eat in and make our own meals with their higher end stainless steel appliances. i would recommend this home for anyone traveling to san francisco.  it was a wonderful home away from home.  thank you for sharing!!!!!! sincerely, the weber\\'s, shields\\' and england\\'severything just very good. thank you.our stay at carrie\\'s home in bernal heights was phenomenal. the house is beautiful, spacious and comfortable, with a good long (extendable!) dining room table and huge open-plan kitchen. i am part of an ed-tech startup, and our five person team came out to stay at carrie\\'s for a full six days and nights to do launch work in sf. the house was our base for the duration of our stay, and for working upstairs, relaxing in the big tv room downstairs and sleeping comfortably while off the clock, it was truly great. highly recommended.what a beautiful space to call home for a week! the group of executives from our company had a great time staying at carrie\\'s home in bernal heights. the home\\'s location was excellent with bart or the highway very close by. even though the highway was close, there really wasn\\'t much noise associated with it. \\r\\n\\r\\ncarrie responded very quickly to the questions i had prior to and during booking the house. the one question i had during the stay was answered within just a few minutes, which was great!\\r\\n\\r\\nour group would recommend staying at this home if it\\'s available.this was my first airbnb experience, and it was great. carrie made everything easy from start to finish. the house was perfect for our group of friends - 3 couples and 2 singles - to have a great getaway in sf. located near bart, with ample parking, it\\'s great for visitors with or without a car. there are also many little shops within walking distance. \\nthe house is beautiful, with ample space, a great sound system, and nice backyard. this would be a great place for families or couples looking for a home base in sf. thanks carrie! we stayed here with 6 people for a conference during the weekend. we immediately encountered issues with the internet, hence arrived late to our first meeting. the wifi issues persisted until our departure day. the house itself was great and looks just like on the photos, had enough space for 6 people and more, and our thanks to carrie for arranging two additional double beds for us to have enough space for everyone.\\r\\nwhat i found disappointing is that carrie, to us, seemed annoyed, not wanting to help with the problems we had. in addition to the wifi issue, one bathroom door was locked from the inside one day which made carrie offer us to leave to a hotel instead of helping resolve the issue. i would have expected more support from her, particularly because at the beginning of our communication she seemed very enthusiastic about our arrival. also, my bed linen had stains and several holes, and there were other things we noticed but avoided telling her to not raise even more issues and cause problems... we hope that this was a one-time negative experience and future guests won\\'t have to go through the same exertions.my family from wisconsin and sf enjoyed a wonderful thanksgiving weekend celebration at carrie\\'s lovely home. the spacious kitchen and dining area were wonderful for cooking and family gathering. this was my first airbnb experience and i would highly recommend. thanks for the hospitality carrie. we all enjoyed your home\\'s eclectic art collection. great experience! feel like home. well prepared, clean,quiet,cozy and warm.lovely well furnished home within walking distance of muni buses and bart.  host very responsive and helpful!  superb views.this rental was a terrific value – spacious, clean, modern with luxurious amenities and i loved the privacy afforded by the layout.  (sometimes large homes pile the bedrooms too close to one another – this was not the case here, hurray!).  this is a great home for modern art lovers, guests with teenagers or multiple couples as the downstairs is nicely separated from the rest of the home with its own full bedroom and bathroom.  abundant light streams in on the main floor with a view of the city which expands across the large kitchen, dining room and through to the main living room. parking was super easy and frankly, everything just felt so easy and spacious – as if i were in regular americana suburbia rather than a city home – zero issues.  carrie and her husband are a witty and professional couple and we are grateful for their accommodating our check in/check out needs.   i’d gladly stay here again on a future visit.carrie was very organized and accommodating.  very prompt with answering any of our questions.\\r\\nthis area within bernal heights neighbourhood was okay.  \\r\\nthe house is located right next to the freeway which was loud at times but you get used to it.our stay at carrie\\'s home was delightful. we were pressed to find a place for multiple coworkers on a work trip during what proved to be a busy week for hotels in the metro sfo area. this home was conveniently located to downtown as well as highways out to other areas. we loved the space and appreciated that there was a lot of privacy with individual rooms/baths but also welcoming common areas. the artwork throughout was our favorite part! we would definitely stay here again! beautiful home, carrie welcomed us from day 1 of reserving the house.  i\\'d recommend this to anyone.carrie\\'s house blew my co-workers and i away! it was massive! carrie is a very very helpful host, and when we needed the code to garage, she replied us swiftly and really took the worry of our rental car being towed away during the night off! carrie\\'s husband is an artist, and the art pieces hanging on every corner of the house are exquisite. we really enjoyed our stay, and we had a lot of fun!!! thumbs up!the description is coherent with the true condition.carrie\\'s house was great and met our needs. it was quite spacious and had all the amenities one needs. it was great being so close to the bart station too. thanks carrie!this was my first airbnb experience and i have to say carrie really made us feel at home. i loved the modern feel of the kitchen and it was great to have a pretty big dining table so we could all have a great time talking and eating together. i would def. recommend it. top host with a great place to stay.\\ncarrie was very helpful with my team checking in. they absolutely  love the place. everything  they needed was there and they loved the house. \\n\\ncarrie went over and above as a host and i highly recommend  anyone to stay here.this was my first time using airbnb, so i was a bit hesitant, but carrie made our experience great! my family and i stayed here for 1 week and we would do it again. we were of all ages (65 to 9 months old!).  it was great for us to have a place to meet in the morning for breakfast, venture out for the day, and then come back at night.  it has things for young kids to do, which was also really helpful with our family. we ordered in a few nights and just relaxed at the house because it was so spacious.  carrie was a great host who answered all of our requests and questions promptly! i would definitely recommend this to others.  this was our first experience with airbnb and carrie\\'s home was amazing! we were a group of 10 people and her spacious home was just perfect.  this home made our stay in san francisco all the more enjoyable!great experience!! awesome house with some epic art!! managment was prompt, responsive and very professional. will defiantly return! thank you everything was as expected. the home was clean and lovely. it was perfect for our family gathering. the house is exactly as shown on the pictures. the big dining table was much appreciated by the whole family. the house is also close to the bart station, which is very convenient. \\r\\nas indicated in some reviews, the house is located right next to the freeway. but unlike what was mentioned in the reviews, we did find it loud all the time and we could not get used to it. this is especially true in the bedroom downstairs. i did find it difficult to fall asleep with the noise.\\r\\nregarding the views, it is true that you can see the excelsior neighborhood far away in the background, which is nice, but you mainly see the freeway in the foreground.\\r\\na few other details:\\r\\n- the internet connection is pretty unreliable.\\r\\n- there is no heating downstairs.\\r\\n- lastly, if you like steaming hot showers, you might be disappointed. there is hot water. but not steaming hot.\\r\\ndespite these details, we had an enjoyable stay.awesome place! tons of space, clean, great location. would definitely stay here again.beautiful house, good location and very quiet neighborhood!not a nice neighborhood ..  for the price of the rental ,far from down town ... it was big enough for a big group ,and had to go buy a coffee maker and a can opener ... would not stay there again .... we very much enjoyed staying at carrie\\'s place. it was just as we had hoped it would be based on the pictures: clean, spacious, and comfortable for our humble family of five. having a garage for parking was a bonus for our rental.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe might have used the outdoor space if it was a little warmer outside, but sf weather is cooler than what we were hoping for - can\\'t blame anyone for that!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe left our apple tv there by mistake and carrie immediately informed us it was on it\\'s way back to us in the mail - that was really appreciated. we would definitely recommend staying here for anyone with discerning taste if you don\\'t mind the traffic noise from the freeway about a hundred and fifty feet away (don\\'t worry - it\\'s on the other side of a barrier wall).we stayed carrier\\'s house for 8 nights,the first day night,our mobile phone was robbed by a black man in the area.the second day,my sunglasses on the car was stolen (the car parked in front of this house overnight),the third day morning ,we got parking tickets from the traffice police .we don\\'t think it is a safe area in sfo.also the house close to the highway,very noisy.房子的所处的区域不安全。第一天在马路边苹果6手机被抢,第二天停在房子门口的汽车内的太阳镜被偷。房子靠近高速,隔音很差。lovely house! great host! we spend quite a good time in san francisco! hope we still get a chance to visit again!loved the place, very spacious (we were 11), well kept, plenty of parking and walking distance to bart. carrie was very quick to reply to any questions we had.we had a wonderful stay at carrie\\'s home.  the apartment is very spacious and each of our teenage/adult kids had their own room which made for a very comfortable experience.  the apartment is well located and we got some delicious bread and cheese from a bakery close by for breakfast, both mornings.  i loved the artwork and décor in every room.  carrie was very responsive to all my questions, this being our first air bnb experience.  lovely stay in a lovely apartment. the space was more than enough for two families (9 in total) and we really enjoyed our three days at carrie\\'s place. the apartment is beautiful and fully equipped. not being used to american big cities, we were initially scared about the distance to the main touristic attractions, but in the end it was not that bad and we managed very well both with taxis and public transports.\\r\\ncarrie has been very helpful and provided us all information and assistance needed.\\r\\nreally, really recommended!\\r\\n\\r\\nnice place. very close to public transportation so we didn\\'t need to rent a car. big  spaces and clean. every thing works. \\nthe rooms need mirrors.\\na little bit noisy during certain hours.\\nin general great!!☺\\nthe comunication with carrie are host was very good.i really enjoyed my stay there, very clean for a good price. carrie was an awesome host, she made sure we had everything we needed.  i\\'ll definitely be staying there again when i head back to la!carrie was a great host!

honestly i did not have much time to spend in the house. but i enjoyed every second in the house.my brother and i had an amazing time staying and hanging out with glenn. not only is he a super host, he turned out to be a great friend to us. one that we would definitely keep in touch with. our san francisco trip was much more enriching because of glenn. he was very helpful in setting us up on our exploration of the city, gave us a ride or two, helped us with our laundry (!) and even helped us dress up for halloween! great thing was that glenn was always around and always went out of his way to make our stay pleasant.\\r\\n \\r\\nhis house is located at a nice neighbourhood. it’s on a hill – so it’s got a nice view and its close by to downtown. there’s a bus that passes by every 20 minutes that takes you to downtown and main city areas. 20 minutes sounds long but it was ok for us. glenn advised us on the exact time the bus will arrive. or we’d just uber it. the room and beds were great and it had a private bathroom. \\r\\n \\r\\nit’ll probably end up being one of the best airbnb experience we would ever have. \\r\\nwe had a very comfortable and pleasant stay at glenn\\'s place - glenn is a very warm and gracious host and makes sure that any questions you might have about the apartment or the city are answered and you have a good time there. the place is in the twin peaks neighborhood which has amazing views and even more importantly, free parking on the street!

glenn has a nice and clean flat in a very calm area of sf. there is a great view of the city from the common livingroom. two good beds and an excellent bath.glenn was a excellent air bnb host. he told us plenty about the city (nice to know facts and what to see and do) he even took us in his car to the restaurant we were going to and gave us a guided tour around that specific area.\\nthe room is clean and nice, we were too but could easily fit 3. the room is just where the entrance to the apartment is so you feel a certain privacy and also you don\\'t feel like you are in the way or disturbing.\\non our arrival glenn took us to the rooftop and showed us a stunning view. \\neverything about this stay was good!clean and comfort apartment room in a quiet area. the living room is shared. since we were out for most of the time, and only came back around 9pm, we didn\\'t use the living room. the kitchen has most cookware and we were allowed to use them, which is very convenient for having breakfast. glenn offered bottled water in refrigerator, free shampoo, conditioner and body lotion in bathroom. he also took us to the roof where we could have a nice view of the city. parking spot is on the street. overall, it\\'s a good living experience~the location was awesome. glenn & taylor are very nice. was plenty of space for 3 people in the room. the apartment is immaculately clean! great location, clean and modern condo.  i would stay at glenns again.  glenn could not have been more welcoming.  not only did he arrange to get me the key at 2 am when i arrived late.   he actually let me commute into town with him just to show me the best way to commute to downtown.  i had a guide!  \\r\\n\\r\\none 2 different occasions he offered wine and cheese after work! who does that?\\r\\n\\r\\non my last day there, as i walked through the common space, he said \"can i make you a caramel macchiato?\"    \\r\\n\\r\\nthe perfect host!glenn is a very kind man which pays a lot of attention took the details and his place reflects it. it was a pleasure staying there. and a try exception to most publications on this site pictures don\\'t make justice of his place, magazine worthy.\\ni look forward to stay at glenn\\'s again.\\n5 stars.glenn was a great host. he was easy to talk to and quick to answer any questions i had. his home was clean, comfortable, and absolutely beautiful. wish i was able to stay there longer!

:)their house is amazing! and she was super nice even after we had too much fun on our vacationmaggie and eric have a really nice place between noe valley and dolores park.  my family really enjoyed our stay. the house was comfortable and luxurious and maggie was absolutely helpful!  the garden out back is fantastic and we enjoyed sitting out there while the kids napped.  really a lovely home.  thanks so much for hosting us!we booked this property for a short trip with my family - turned out to be perfect. we have 2 kids - so the size was great - the house was very comfortable. the kitchen was perfect for eating in. the neighborhood was super kid friendly with a nice park nearby, as well as being close to golden gate park. there were lots of coffee shops, wine shop, and restaurants nearby. terry was great - we didn\\'t have any problems but felt that if we did he\\'d be right there. in short - an super lovely house with a great host. if you\\'re coming to sf with a family, this is the way to go.a wonderful, comfortable home in a fun neighborhood. the house is beautiful, with a nice private garden/backyard with a gas grill. there\\'s also a piano if you\\'re musically inclined.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are lots of great shops, restaurants & markets within walking distance on geary (plus a walgreens) or within a short drive or longer walk on clement. we loved joe\\'s coffee shop at the corner, the restaurants around 25th ave. & clement, and the green apple bookstore (new & used) at clement & 4th ave.\\r\\n\\r\\ngolden gate park is also very close, and you can catch the 28 bus downtown on geary & park presidio. beats fighting the traffic and hunting for difficult, expensive parking.\\r\\n\\r\\nterry was a very welcoming, accommodating & accessible host.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat house, great location. i would recommend it.the house was amazing.  a beautiful house in a beautiful part of town.  minutes away from hundred of great places to eat, and golden gate park.  we couldn\\'t believe how nice terry\\'s house was!it was wonderful. i was in family and staying in house, close to market and near to major attractions in sf, help us a lot! we have great time there. the house is so beatiful and works very well to us.this house was an excellent  base for touring san francisco , we had a wonderful time . thanks again to terry and his family.this location is amazing.  the most beautiful market is just steps away; the produce is so fresh and arranged so beautifully it looks like a food museum.  the neighborhood has every kind of ethnic restaurant you can think of ( and some you can\\'t)!  golden gate park is so close by and full of walking trails , gardens, museums etc.  easy access to busses and other transportation.  the home is clean, comfortable, cozy and welcoming.  the hosts were very accommodating to our daughter\\'s previewing the house and very magnanimous in sharing their home.  erry\\'s house was a great place to explore san francisco. we keep all 4 remember the first moments after a long trip we discovered this place. we knew we had made the right choice. the house, in addition to being large, very well decorated and has all the comfort you may expect. its location is an asset, near golden gate park and its museums (we walked ..) and 5 minutes from the golden gate bridge by car .. it\\'s just wonderful. to discover the rest of sf, a bus 1 minute from the house brings you in about 20 minutes in all other sights of the city with no more than a 5 minute wait. very simple and nice\\r\\ndo not hesitate therefore a second if you want to discover this wonderful city of sf. moreover, terry is very communicative and we had the chance to cross at the corner coffee to talk about our stay. it makes you feel good in it and nothing is complicated with him. a beautiful memory for all of us.great place to stay, especially when you around and about the city, marin, napa, sonoma and the east bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nparking is great, house is lovely and  big enough for 4 easily.especially the kittens are always out for some extra care and tenderness. we enjoyed it very much - and had to use the fireplace twice as of the sf summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nwill stay there again for sure!my family and i had an amazing time at the whalen home.  it was myself, my husband and my four year old son and my mother eventually joined us for a few days.  the house was roomy and had a great outdoor space and trampoline for my son.  it had all the necessary amenities plus being able to get in and out of the city as needed.  we also really enjoyed how relaxed we felt in the house despite being just a block away from a major thoroughfare.  would definitely recommend.terry was a wonderful host and ensured me and my family have the best time in san francisco. the house is absolutely beautiful and is stocked with the most thoughtful supplies. the option to drink wine was an additional bonus:)house was soo charming, just as the description, great neighborhood. terry left a great \"instruction / recommendations\" guide, with hints to domestic house stuff, as well as to recommended restaurants and bars.\\r\\nall went perfect and it was a great spot to enjoy sf at its best with the family.this has been a great experience for my family and me.  terry and his family shared their house with us! \\nthe house is actually better than the description and surpassed all our expectations.  the instructions were on point, the support was unbelievable, terry even went out of his way to meet us and give us all the help we needed. \\noverall, we loved sf and we loved the house\\nthanks againthe house was exactly what we expected and all that we had hoped for. it was beautifully furnished, the kitchen was well supplied for cooking which we did every day, and the bedrooms were very comfortable & suited our needs, although a bit more room for our clothing would have been appreciated. the neighborhood was great offering plenty of food stores for shopping, restaurants for eating out & easy transportation for getting around. all in all the house was great & terry was readily available for helping out, certainly made our stay in sf a memorable one. this is a lovely spacious family home, with a lovely garden and a great kitchen (which alas i didnt get to use on this short trip). the area is quiet but has some really nice restaurants (great sushi!). an early morning trip to nearby baker beach was lovely.we had a great time in san francisco. we immediately felt at home and loved the house and the garden. golden gate park is at walking distance, just like presidio. the rest we did by bike, bus, car and taxi.\\nwhile we were staying in the house, there were fleas. terry was supportive in dealing with this problem and reacted quickly.  nicole and her place were the best! the home is stunning and has amazing views of the city. located in a quiet part but of the neighborhood, but still near a lot of shops, restaurants, etc. we had a bigger group there for the day and the space accommodated us all perfectly. \\r\\n\\r\\nfurthermore, nicole was extremely helpful and communicative throughout the entire process. she made the whole trip easy! cannot wait to book the space again :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks nicole!nicole was an amazing hosts who made sure we had all that we needed. i appreciated how quick she was to respond to request and was ready to answer any questions. she made us feel welcome for our team offsite.it was a pleasant stay. anything i needed she was able to provide.it was really nice ... worth for short staying !!annie is very hospitable- fruit and water in the fridge, the room was squeaky clean, and the mattress very comfortable!  off street parking, private and quiet.  perfect!the house was easy to get to, clean, and had everything ready. it\\'s more of a commuter house so don\\'t expect much interaction between you and the host or you and the other guests. for my situation though it was perfect. the room was clean, comfortable and quiet. annie was there to welcome us and prompt responded to messages on the airbnb app. she was very kind and helped with storing luggage post check out. public transport is available very close to her house. all in all a good accommodation and would surely book again.my stay with annie was pretty much as advertised. the room looks exactly like the pictures. you have your own entrance and it\\'s very private. it\\'s extremely close to public transportation, though it is a 25+ minute bus ride to the more popular sections of san fran. the walls are kinda thin, so you might hear some noises from upstairs. it didn\\'t affect my sleep, but if you\\'re a light sleeper, this might not be the spot for you. i enjoyed my stay with annie.annie was a wonderfull host. very thoughtfull and lots of fun to talk with. the room was like a hotelroom, spacious, private bathroom ensuite, refrigerator and most important, clean! the small kitchen is to share, and has some basic things like microwave, toaster and a hotplate. the busstop is just around the corner. if possible, take bus 14r, it will take you in half an hour to the city. the other busses take forever cause the stop at every corner.\\nalthough we had a great time at annie\\'s place i have to say it\\'s noisy. the walls and ceiling are thin so you can hear the \\'neighbours\\'. annie was a nice host. our experience was that the neighbors were a little too loud and the area was cold. we reached out to airbnb for help but instead were subject to putting two of our trip days on hold waiting for something to be done but in the end they did not let us rebook until time had passed. poor customer service. \\r\\nwhat a rockstar experience!! i rented the bus with a group of friends for a getaway in vegas. mike the driver was very professional and accommodating – he picked us up in san francisco with the bus stocked with all of our requested items. the bus was sleek, clean, and super tricked out. the trip felt vip trip from start to finish. can\\'t wait to do it again... \\r\\nsiena is a fantastic host. clear location instructions, room precisely as advertised, welcoming, clean, quiet... a great experience.very nice place, gracious and accommodating host. pictures and description were accurate, but i think the place is a bit bigger and nicer than i thought. would recommend and would stay here again.marisol\\'s house is awesome. she let us have an early check in and helped us a lot during the trip. the house is spacious and has a good location. easy to commute via public transportation or uber. after checking out, we found we lost a watch in the house. marisol shipped it to us asap. definitely we will stay there again and recommend this place to all of you. lupe and mari are some of the nicest people i\\'ve ever met! they were so welcoming and helpful and both of their smiles were constant and genuine. the place is huge! the house goes way back and the bedrooms are big and roomy and the kitchen has an area between the main section and the patio that isn\\'t even in the pictures. i guess you\\'d describe it as a kind of sunroom. it\\'s hard to find an actual formal dining room in original san francisco homes and this one has one twice as big as the biggest one i\\'ve seen. there\\'s even a fireplace in it and they really did a good job throughout with the remodel as it\\'s kept all the old built-in details and woodwork yet has all the modern amenities i\\'d needed. their place is across from a big park with a swimming pool, baseball diamond and play structures so i think families would enjoy staying there as well as a group of friends that want to vacation together. the place is so big that you can\\'t hear anything going on in the front end of the home if you\\'re in the back part so one can really have privacy if they want. besides the patio there\\'s also a back yard and a couple bikes and the neighborhood has lots of bike lanes. they live near a bart station and a street car line is right outside so getting everywhere was really easy. tons of shops with everything i needed are easily within walking distance so i didn\\'t drive very much even though i had a car. when i did drive parking was easy because of the park which was a huge relief as i\\'d heard parking in san francisco could be a nightmare. i can\\'t believe they have the nightly rate so low because compared to other places it was the best deal in town. you can tell a lot of love is in the home because they keep it up really well and it\\'s absolutely spotless. if i brought kids here i wouldn\\'t worry at all about them crawling or playing on the floor because they\\'d probably get up cleaner than when they rolled around on it. the park across the street makes it ideal if you do bring kids and you want to take them swimming or let them run around. obviously i loved the place and thought lupe and mari were the best hosts or i would never have written so much. they were super accommodating and helped me last minute even though their listing says they need notice and have a certain amount of days you can stay. it seems like they\\'d help anyone if they could even if it was same day notice or the stay was less or more than they\\'d ideally want. the price is amazing for what you get and the next time i take a vacation with my family or friends in sf i\\'ll be staying here....the place was perfect for our super bowl  weekend. marisol made sure we were taken care of. i would definitely recommend her place to anyone coming into the sf areamarisol and lupe where great hosts, very helpful with navigating the surrounding area.  the home was spacious, well decorated and provided the perfect place for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe care package was a very nice touch and it was equipped with family games, we loved it :), and we would come back again and would recommend to anyone looking to visit san fran.\\r\\nhenry was great from the beginning, quick to respond and was able to contact him at any time if required. the place was great, very clean, very comfy beds and was virtually brand new in a very good location. i would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. i would definitely stay here again. thank you henry for everything, made our trip to san fran that little bit better. a newly-decorated apt with paint smell, cute bedroom n nice location downtown. my friend left his sunglasses there, we try to contact henry but noone reply…it was a smooth experience using henry\\'s place. we were in san fran for a conference and we enjoyed staying here. great neighborhood also close to bart and 101 access.this is a lovely property and henry was very easy to deal with.  it is a great location with some great coffee shops and theatres within easy walking distance.   we visited henry\\'s apartment for a week. it was nice staying in a newly refurbished, clean and comfortable apartment. location is pretty good, it\\'s close to a range of public transport options as well as cafes, parks, safeway, walgreens etc. \\r\\n\\r\\none thing to note is that there is quite a lot of street noise at this location, particularly in the 2 street-facing bedrooms. i find this is generally common throughout san francisco however. the apartment was very central and great to share with friends or colleagues. everything was very clean,  i would recommend.the house was nice, neat and fully stocked with everything we needed. location is great as well!\\r\\nhenry is a lovely host :)paul was a great host. he left the house very clean and was very responsive to all of our needs and questions. his place is in a great location and you can get anywhere in the city in 15-20 minutes.  overall 5 star experience!great location and beautiful bedrooms! jeri is very friendly and gave us a lot of good advices. highly recommend her place, it was truly awesome and we had a great experience in san francisco. jeri was great - super welcoming and easy to coordinate with. place has a great location and would recommend this to others.great experience and love her cute dog!jeri was a great host, very accommodating to me and my family when we made our trip to sf over the summer. her home was located across the street from golden gate park and only a few short ( driving ) minutes away from the gg bridge. and be sure to ask her for her recommendations to great chinese restaurants! jeri is friendly and the rooms are clean. the street noise was a surprise and made sleeping well difficult. the property is located in the mission district, close to a range of interesting shops, restaurants and cafes. the house is wonderfully designed and kept and you feel right at home when you walk in. you get the full benefit of the sun in the house and the balcony and bbq is great for a warm day! while jonathan was not there personally to meet us, he was excellent at checking in with us, providing information on getting around town and tips on places to go and eat. i highly recommend this place!great family rental. wonderful modern house in the mission. bright and open floor plan with both an amazing backyard and rooftop patio experience. simple and easy instructions as well as local recommendations provided. a wonderful getaway within the city. would definitely recommend!jonathan\\'s home is spectacular. we stayed for a short visit but thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful house and were able to settle in and relax immediately. the kitchen is fantastic for cooking and hanging out, especially in beautiful weather. it is very peaceful and quiet, which we really appreciated, being in the city. jonathan is an excellent host and made sure that we had everything we needed, as was also available for any questions or concerns we might have had. we had a wonderful time staying in jonathan\\'s spotless home.  the house is  modern and very chic, it is located in the mission, my favorite neighborhood in sf.  there are many of the best restaurants in the city mere blocks away as well as easy public transportation options.  we found it so easy to get around with a car and highly recommend it.  check in was easy and the house book is the best i\\'ve seen with any and all instructions one needs and spot-on recommendations for eating and entertainment.  the neighborhood is very quiet and the beds comfy, we slept very well.  i highly recommend and would definitely stay here again.  the space was precisely as described in the listing. it really suited our needs well (training room for about 10 people). host was perfectly prompt and did everything he could to make us feel welcome and taken care of. would definitely book this listing again for similar needs in the future!amazing home with amazing views on an amazing street.\\r\\n\\r\\ni lived in san francisco for many years and it\\'s definitely a city where location is everything. why? views, transit, and microclimates. for these reasons (and more), i have always admired liberty street and could not resist the address when i saw it listed on airbnb, drew and nick\\'s home is utterly charming and ideal for anyone who wants to experience the most out of the city. you get decks, views, great weather, dorlores park, the mission, and public transportation at your doorstep all rolled into one. \\r\\n\\r\\ndid i mention the views? the airbnb pics don\\'t do the views justice. i\\'m not sure whether the favorite part of my stay was waking up to a downtown view from the bed or my nightcap on the deck watching the sun set over the city. location, location, location!  one of our favorite things to do on vacation is to explore on foot, and this home is in the perfect place to do that.  we walked to the farmers market on 24th street, mission dolores park to people watch and to dinner on valencia.  we should note that walking in this neighborhood provides built in exercise with the hills.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view from the home\\'s decks was our favorite part of the house and is nothing short of spectacular.  the home is really spacious with a fabulous kitchen and built in seating area, and it\\'s full of light and very charming.  it\\'s very easy to feel at home here.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe\\'d highly recommend this lovely place!we are so glad we stayed here!  perfect location, easy to walk to anything we needed.  public transportation got us to and from downtown in a snap.  so nice to arrive to fresh bread and cheese...especially after a long flight!  would absolutely stay again.this place is amazing. i strongly recommend it. everyone was helpful, the views are spectacular, my only regret is we didn\\'t stay longer! wow, drew & nick\\'s place is just fantastic. on emigrating over to san francisco from the uk we were lucky enough to spend 6 weeks here whilst we found a place to rent longer term.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighbourhood itself is pretty and really friendly and the neighbours are great - they were very welcoming and made us feel right at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nonto the house...\\r\\nthe pictures look great, but it is even better in the flesh. if you want a decadent yet relaxed experience of life in san francisco, this is the place for you.\\r\\n\\r\\nive never stayed in such a well stocked house - they really have thought of everything. their home is beautifully decorated with interesting bits and pieces in every room adding to the relaxed-yet-styled design of the place. \\r\\n\\r\\nwaking up, opening the bedroom balcony doors to be met with a view spanning across the whole city is breathtaking - something we\\'re really going to miss.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks so much for sharing your home, nick and drew - it\\'s awesome!second time staying here for a good reason. the place is amazing! we just spent two month\\'s at drew\\'s dream house. everything was perfect : great, walkable neighborhood, beautifully decorated house, two decks with a stunning view of the city. great amenities (wifi, printer/scanner; appletv). this became our home for two months, and we couldn\\'t have been happier than therewe recently stayed here with our three kids. i can\\'t say enough about the home, the location, the communication, the view or the many details of this place. without question, we would stay here again! \\nthe home was welcoming, bright and enjoyable. the views were fantastic. the home has a unique style. it was fun to be there and to have family over for dinner and just relax when i wanted to. the home has a nice den to cozy up in to read a good book or watch television. \\r\\nthe neighborhood was very nice even with many hills to walk up. i loved being near the dolores park, 18th street with birite, restaurants as well as valencia where there are many local shops and restaurants. castro is nearby too with restaurants worth a try. my stay was for two weeks, and i am glad i stayed in this home. we stayed at drew\\'s place for 10 days in august and enjoyed it a lot. first, the location is great between castro and mission and just a few steps from dolores park which is perfect to relax (also great for kids with the large playground area. our 3 year-old daughter spent fantastic afternoons there).\\r\\nthen the house is large and cosy, with everythink you need to enjoy your stay in sf. last but not least of course, the view on the city is amazing, you may spend hours looking at it!\\r\\nwe had the most amazing stay at drew and nick\\'s home. not only is it near amenities and the beautiful dolores park, it is tastefully decorated, styled and well furnished, making it truly a home away from home. highly recommended to anyone who prefers to live like locals on their travels. the perfect place to stay in san francisco. the house is indeed stunning; spacious, beautifully decorated, and with those magnificent views. the two outdoor terraces are perfect for relaxing after a long (or short) day exploring san francisco. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighbourhood is wonderful, a great mix of hipster coffee bars and restaurants, old school taquerias, vintage shops and the fascinating murals everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\ni can\\'t recommend the house enough. drew and his team were responsive to our requests and always helpful. \\r\\n\\r\\nfor us the house was really perfect; i struggle to find any criticism! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe only thing which might bother some people is the house is near a muni track; so you hear the trains going past - we did not find the sound obtrusive. to offset this, the house is in a very quiet street so no disturbance of bars/etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighlights:\\r\\n- laura (house manager) was responsive, thorough and courteous. \\r\\n- the house is well appointed, spacious and has a gorgeous view with amble outdoor space.\\r\\n- location is very central to shops, restaurants, dolores park and transportation.\\r\\n- parking is relatively easy to find with permit ($40.00).\\r\\n\\r\\nother notes:\\r\\n- the j church muni line runs directly behind the house. trains are frequent from very early morning to after midnight. if you are a light sleeper, you might find the noise and vibration disruptive. \\r\\n-we appreciated drew\\'s polite and prompt response to our concerns.\\r\\nthis is the third time i\\'ve rented this home, and i can\\'t get enough. the hosts are beyond helpful and the views are incredible. it\\'s become one of my favorite places to travel to. i would recommend it in a heartbeat! yes, very welcome! the pictures on the listing were very accurate. laura was great and even came by to set up the couch bed, and was there for us when we had questions. the house and neighborhood is beautiful, and the view can\\'t be beat. we will definitely be coming back. great host! unique place! awesome view from the master bedroom!my girlfriends and i had an incredible stay at drew\\'s house in mission/castro. their home is absolutely gorgeous, exactly as pictured. the outdoor deck is pretty unbelievable. one thing i will say is that the master bed mattress is extremely comfortable & plush, but the guest bed may be a bit on the tougher side. also it\\'s worthwhile to note that parking in the area is not free and you gotta pay $40 for a parking permit that the house manager will provide for you. \\r\\n \\r\\nif we come back to sanfran, will definitely look into this place again!  270 liberty street was exactly as promoted and so much more.  easily within walking distance to great restaurants in the mission which is a hot location in the city that is real san francisco.  our hosts gave us great tips on experiencing all the great wonders the location has to offer.  \\r\\nthe home was welcoming, easy to navigate and  a lovely alternative to a hotel.  there is nothing like experiencing true san francisco from a neighborhood. i keep booking this listing because it\\'s become one of my favorite places in all my travels. the place is simply charming, the views are beautiful, and booking has always been easy. i would absolutely recommend this place. this house is perfect. i worked with laura, who is one of the property managers and she was very friendly over email, and was open to providing any additional recommendations or information.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house rules/information pamphlet is full of wonderful information and suggestions for all sorts of restaurants and activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nand of course, this house was amazing. the views must be among the best in the city. the location is outstanding. the bed is very comfortable. i just hope i have another opportunity to stay here!beautiful house!  amazing location and views!!  extremely easy to check in and out.  usually stay at ritz and this was much nicer (and more like home).what a beautiful home! i could not believe my luck that i actually got to spend 4 days living on liberty street. the view is stunning and the house is incredibly stylish/well decorated (not to mention impeccably clean).  getting into the house was super easy and laura (the house manager) was incredibly helpful in the days leading up to our stay. don\\'t miss the chance to stay here! my only complaint is that i could not stay longer.i stayed 7 nights with friends at drew\\'s. the house was really confortable and had every comodity we needed. it is located in a beutiful and quiet part of the neighborhood. the muni j line is just in front of the house and was really convenient to have a short ride to the center. would go back anytime.hands down, best airbnb i\\'ve been to! beautiful. i love this place. drew and nick\\'s home overlooking dolores park is stunning. i was in town for a few nights with my brothers and this place made our stay unforgettable. the back porch is utterly fantastic with the hypnotic view of the city, the bay, and the trees dancing in the breeze. everything you could ask for is provided (and more). (that view from the master bedroom?!? cut it out.) check in and check out was a breeze- we felt very safe and parking was easy on the street. even sitting and relaxing on the front steps, surrounded by flowers was enjoyable. some amazing restaurants, bars and shopping is within a few blocks, but we spent an equal amount of time just reveling at \"home\". what a place! our family\\'s second stay on liberty street was extraordinary! we took advantage of the proximity to dolores park, the mission, the castro and noe valley. \\nthe decks are comfortable and the view\\'s ridiculous. inside the house we enjoyed the thoughtful amenities and beautiful art. if we have the opportunity to stay here again, we wouldn\\'t hesitate. an a++ experience. everything was great at this wonderful house on liberty street. we loved the decks, the wonderful light kitchen and dining room, the great book collection, and the neighborhood. how great to be steps from the njudah train that takes you to downtown sf! thank-you drew!the view!  oh my.  that deck with the strings of lights, comfy seating, and unparalleled view is worth it\\'s weight in gold. the street itself is very quiet and peaceful, and even though the j streetcar passes directly behind the house, it creates little noise--just a low hum--like the wind.  both of my kids slept like rocks while we were there.  also, you can board that streetcar just three doors down, which is super convenient.  the house is an old victorian, which means it is loaded with character (and also a bit musty).  the master bedroom and kitchen have both been wonderfully updated.  the water pressure is the best i have ever experienced--i wish i could take that shower home with me!  dolores park is just a couple of blocks away--with an amazing new playground!  we had a great time.it is rare for me to visit anyone\\'s house, anywhere, and instantly feel that i could happily move in for good.  that was my reaction to this place.  it\\'s a very personal thing, i guess - but what is indisputable is that a lot of work and love has gone into making this house what it is.  oh, and the location is unbeatable.  a wonderful stay.the house is just incredible! very comfortable rooms, an amazing view and perfect location. the hosts were very responsive, kind and left very detailed instructions about the house. \\r\\n\\r\\none of the rooms has a foldable bed, which was my concern, but it is actually super comfortable and fits easily 2 people if needed. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely stay there again! the house is beautiful, the view is incredible and the location is perfect. we stayed here with our teenage kids and we all loved it. it was the ideal base for exploring san francisco and a wonderful place to come back to. so many superlatives here but really, i can\\'t recommend drew and nick\\'s house enough. by far one of the most beautiful listings i\\'ve ever stayed in! check-in was simple, great location, and the house and views are as beautiful as pictured.\\r\\n\\r\\nhope to be able to stay again. thanks drew!we enjoyed our stay and would go back!we spent a wonderful week in sf in drew\\'s house. everything was as described, in perfect conditions. the place is fantastic and the views from the apartment are incredible. i would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting sf and will certainly consider it for my next trip.\\r\\n\\r\\neverything about this house was perfect!  we had an amazing trip and i started to feel like the house was mine!  i now know what i want to do for a master bedroom and bath.  thank you for providing a wonderful place for us to base from.  i hope i can stay here again next year!\\r\\n\\r\\n-steve\\r\\nthank you drew and nick for hosting us!  everything was great.  the view from kitchen was stunning, the house was beautifully decorated, and was as it appeared in the photos.  great location.  quiet neighbourhood, nice cafes and restaurants within walking distance. it was just a few steps to the muni j-church line; or you may choose uber.  drew was easy to communicate,  and the detailed guest/house manual was very useful.  we had a delightful time in this house and would definitely stay there again!\\r\\namazingly beautiful, charming and light-filled home perfectly located above the recently renovated, vibrant dolores mission park in a fabulous area of sf notable for its classic architecture, gorgeous murals and many of the city\\'s best restaurants and cafes!  our hosts were incredibly welcoming and made every aspect of our stay pleasant and smooth.  beds and bedding are incredibly comfortable, bathrooms are large and the kitchen is fully equipped.  landscaping is fragrant and charming, neighbors are friendly, and street parking was easy.  multiple decks provide sweeping views of downtown - we loved our mornings sipping coffee on the patio listening to the birds in the trees and our evenings savoring a glass of wine while taking in the twinkling city lights.\\r\\nthank you for a perfect home away from home - we will be back again and again!the home on liberty street is absolutely stunning. the home is comfortable and well furnished with fabulous views in a great location in san francisco. drew was available to  assist with any questions we had and recommended great cafes and bakeries for our stay. we would certainly stay here again.we absolutely loved our stay at drew and nick\\'s house. the view from the house is simply stunning and we spent as much time as possible soaking up the views of the city from both decks.\\r\\n\\r\\nas a base for the city the house is perfectly situated, with easy access to downtown via the j line, walking distance to the mission, noe valley and castro. very close to all the action, but on a lovely quiet block.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is beautiful and fully equipped for a family or larger group and incredibly comfortable. drew and nick were fantastic hosts, incredibly knowledgable, kind and thoughtful. we can\\'t recommend their home highly enough.we had an absolutely amazing time and enjoyed everything about drew\\'s house. the deck and  view are even more beautiful in person and it was hard to tear ourselves away from it. this house perfectly accommodated the 5 adults in our family and was in a fabulous vacation! we couldn\\'t have asked for a better house or trip; we would love to come back and visit. it is a wonderful house, located well, nice views... highly recommended!really nice combination of easy access to downtown with a great neighborhood feel. view of the sf skyline is stunning and the home is beautiful and comfortable. beds were ridiculously comfortable and the shower reminded us of niagara falls. nick & drew were extremely caring, thoughtful and conscientious hosts.maura and his husband we\\'re very welcoming and kind. their home is truly lovely and you can find everything in their surroundings, it is a great neibourhood. their home is super big and can host 5 people very comfortably. the kitchen is awesome, we actually cooked our christmas dinner there. we had a very nice experience on our holiday to sf thanks to our hosts. and i can leave out they even left a bottle of sparkling wine as a welcome gift! it was great!i had a fabulous time. maura ferguson was so helpful with every aspect of my stay. she was always available to answer questions. her place was clean and efficient. not to mention its great location! i would definitely stay there again.our family (of five) had a super stay at maura´s house! the apartment was very functional, clean and well-equipped - and looked exactly as presented. the neighborhood, bernal heights, was also very nice. the hilltop nearby has an amazing view, the local grocery shop had everything we needed and there were several nice restaurants in the area. maura (and airenvy) was a perfect host - easy to communicate with and responded immediately to our questions. will definitely recommend the place to others, thanks a lot!a lovely, warm home from which to explore sf. maura and miguel were excellent, responsive hosts and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.good location. close to charming shops, grocery stores and restaurants. great parks nearby. the flat closely resembles the photos. downstairs bathroom is nicely updated, the upstairs bathroom could use some work. maura was friendly and very easy to communicate with. it was an amazing stay! wonderful experience! my colleagues and i had ample space to work while also having enough space to relax separately without getting in each other\\'s way. the staff was so nice and helpful. very clean and comes with great amenities like cookies and a gym. would definitely stay here again! i\\'d recommend this place - nice people, great deal, awesome geckos.as a first time host jessica did a great job.  her home on the border of noe and mission is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful views of the bay.  she supplied us with add\\'l slippers so we took our shoes off inside the apt. because her floors are pristine.  she has a studio downstairs so she is available if we needed her but also invisible when we didn\\'t need her.  the noise though does travel between one floor to another as is customary in older homes. thanks to jessica.\\r\\nvery nice and pleasure to stay in her house.\\r\\nhouse is marvellous, clean all seems new.\\r\\npiano is perfect.\\r\\nit is an absolutely amazing house. beatiful and comfortable, great location. we could not have had a better experience staying at jessica\\'s house. the house is immaculate, incredibly stylish and so spacious and light. there\\'s even a piano! the kitchen was brand new and so well-equipped and jessica kindly provided delicious coffee for us. the bedrooms are spacious - one has a breath-taking view over the city and the bay bridge. the master bedroom is enormous - with an en suite and huge cupboards. the other two are sweet rooms and there\\'s a second good sized bathroom  upstairs and a downstairs. \\r\\n\\r\\nthere really isn\\'t a single thing to fault this house - it\\'s perfect and jessica herself was so kind to us, going out of her way to help. it made our trip to my brother\\'s wedding even more perfect than we had hoped. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe wished we could move in! i cannot recommend it highly enough. even the street was beautiful, and so convenient for transport. perfect perfect perfect. a wonderful home in a beautiful city! fantastic location, and jessica is an incredible and warm hostess. highest possible recommendation!\\r\\nwhat a wonderful experience this was! jessica was most gracious as our host and her home is absolutely gorgeous!!! we were welcomed pleasantly upon our arrival and jessica was accommodating from the moment that we arrived until we left. the house was pristine and extremely comfortable. we appreciated jessica\\'s hospitality and loved that we were encouraged to play the piano :) it was an ideal situation for the business trip we took to san francisco and we 100% would do this again - in a heartbeat! thanks again for everything, jessica!! we had a great time at jessica\\'s place. she took very good care of us and the house is beautiful and easy to feel comfortable in. the neighborhood is great and a lot of nice restaurants, cafes and shops is in walking distance. although we were in sf for work and not for vacation, the house and neighborhood helped to be super relaxed and to enjoy the time in the city - way better than any hotel could offer.i stayed at jessica\\'s gorgeous home with a group of work colleagues, while working out of our san francisco office. it is a classic san francisco victorian home nestled in a fabulous area! i absolutely loved everything about it. it\\'s gorgeously renovated and impeccably clean. i highly recommend anyone to stay here, i certainly would love to again! four perfect days in this noe valley home from home.\\r\\n\\r\\ndelighted by this property full of period details - the high ceilings, sweeping staircase, wood panelled dining room - yet modernised immaculately. the kitchen was generous - think chef\\'s hob and oven - and the built-in seating area offered a perfect view of the hummingbirds each morning with our granola.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe master bedroom is a knockout: a big light filled room with plenty of storage space, über comfy bed and smart ensuite. the second double, while a lot smaller and not ensuite, enjoys a glorious view of downtown sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location of the house is also fantastic. a short walk up 24th leads to noe valley, a lovely neighbourhood with boutiques (the mill for example), plus wholefoods - perfect for the breakfast shop. valencia st, meanwhile, with its brilliant coffee shops (ritual mere minutes away!), shops, restaurants and bars, is almost on your doorstep. \\r\\n\\r\\nfor those looking for the kick of mission combined with the charm of noe, this house is hard to beat.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks jennifer for a super stay...you need just one word to describe jessica\\'s townhouse in noe valley: awesome!\\r\\nwe could not have found a better place in san francisco to spend the holiday\\r\\nseason and new years eve: a gorgeous view from one of the bedrooms over\\r\\nthe whole town, tastefully decorated bed- and bathrooms, living- and dining room and\\r\\na fantastic kitchen that doesn\\'t lack a single item to prepare great dining and breakfast.\\r\\nso much more value than even the most fancy hotel in town! we highly recommend\\r\\nthis place and will have it in our travel journal as the place in town to consider when\\r\\ncoming back. thank you jessica for making your house available for travellers.\\r\\nthe second i left this house i started missing every inch of it. me and my friends stayed here for 17 days and liked every minute of it. the location is just amazing, just a few minutes walk you will find the bars and restaurants located in valencia etc. just 5 min walk to the bart station! jessica stays downstairs but we almost forgot about that as we had as much privacy as we could ever need. also, jessica was very easy to reach if we needed something, via email or the phone.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is very clean and tidy. the internet connection is fast and reliable and so is the adjustable heat. the beds are amazing and very comfortable! then the kitchen is basically everything you could ever want.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe experience was great and i would definitely come back here in the future.stunning home full of period features in the perfect location; in quaint noe valley and a few minutes walk to valencia street for restaurants, bars and cute boutiques.\\r\\nthe bedrooms are gorgeous - one has a superb view over the city. the master bedroom is huge with a spacious en-suite and one of the most comfy beds that i have ever slept it! \\r\\njessica was the perfect host - really going above and beyond to make our stay absolutely wonderful. thank you for the recommendation of boogaloos for brunch on our last day, we are still speaking about how great it was :)\\r\\ni would recommend jessica’s beautiful home to anyone planning a trip to san francisco!jessica\\'s house is a real san francisco gem. it is a perfect victorian house, in the most desirable part of town. the refurbishment is top-class, and the house is very comfortable. we loved the kitchen with its breakfast alcove; the bathrooms are beautiful with deep baths and lovely hot showers. it\\'s very close to bart and the streetcar. 24th street is a nice neighbourhood. \\njessica is a fantastic host. she gave us a warm welcome and then was very discreet indeed. she gave us some good tips and we enjoyed chatting with her. she has fantastic local property knowledge. \\n\\noverall, a five-star experience which we would recommend to anyone.jessica\\'s home was beautiful and perfect for the purpose, and she was thorough and easy to communicate with. everything went smoothly, although my colleagues arrived at slightly different times late at night. thank you for the stay!our vacation was amazing, thanks to a lovely home and a wonderful host.  jessica\\'s home is breathtaking, beautifully decorated, warm, comfortable, and spacious.  the charm of the 100+ year old victorian is still present, but updated with modern kitchens and bathrooms.  everything was top notch - the linens provided, her warm welcome and check-in\\'s throughout our stay - not to mention a perfect location, close to the mission and noe valley.  public transportation was easily accessed, and you can walk to all that noe valley has to offer.  the home was clean, and jessica texted us upon our arrival to let us know she was ready and waiting for us.  the home is on a lovely, quiet street.  the french doors and quaint deck offered a lovely place for morning coffee or evening cocktails.  i highly recommend jessica and her beautiful home to air bnb travelers.the house is gorgeous, very clean and the beds are very comfortable. jessica is a great host: she is friendly and easily accessible if/when need. we felt like home. i highly recommend jessica and her beautiful home to any traveler. jessica\\'s house is lovely. my colleagues and i had a great time staying at her  house.my colleagues and i recently stayed in jessica\\'s home for a work trip.  it was perfect for that purpose, but it would also be wonderful for a vacation.  it is a beautiful but comfortable home with no detail spared in an absolutely perfect san francisco location (literally exactly on the border of the mission and noe valley with tons of wonderful restaurants, bars and shops in walking distance).  jessica was an extremely warm and helpful host.  i would definitely stay again!!the house is amazingly beautiful, comfortable, clean and super well located. if you are in a business trip it can be a good option. jessica is easy to reach and helpful in case you need. she also made a guide about good restaurants around, very nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, i have to tell you about our experience:\\r\\nthe house has many rules, not hard to follow, though. but the owner did inspections in the house everyday while we were at the office, including in our bedrooms. we found our things moved from one place to another and sticky notes about what we should or not to do. in the last night, sheets were removed from two beds, but we still were using the rooms. we felt observed and uncomfortable. we thought we would have more privacy renting a entire house. we were a group of 4 ladies working the whole day, we didn\\'t understand the owner\\'s behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you prefer infra-structure, go for it. if you look for a place that feels more like home than a hotel, i don\\'t think it is a good option.jessica was a great host, my colleagues and i enjoyed her house a lot. the house is really clean. the kitchen, bathrooms are modern and were remodeled well, but it still has the taste of \"the san francisco victorian house\" - i liked it a lot.\\r\\njessica is friendly and helpful. i didn\\'t need much help from her this time, but she would have been really helpful if we needed.due to a last minute change i was not able to stay, but my colleagues reported jessica\\'s house was as described - very comfortable and beautifully presented.  i have stayed nearby and the location is perfect and a great base for visiting san francisco. jessica was very friendly and accommodating. she normally only lets 6 people stay at her place but allowed us to have 7 for one of the nights. the house was very clean and well-kept. we enjoyed full access to the entire upstairs floor and main level. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is in mission, and the neighborhood was great. it was only a couple of miles from downtown sf, and it\\'s also right by taqueria el farolito, which has awesome food.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s worth noting that the wifi signal didn\\'t reach 3 of the bedrooms upstairs. it wasn\\'t a problem for us since all of us had lte phones and just used those.\\r\\n\\r\\nit was the first time for most of us in sf and we stayed for 5 nights. it was a great time and i would recommend this place to others considering it.given the size of our family, we needed to rent a home during our stay in san francisco.  well, we definitely picked the perfect place, as our host jessica, was gracuois, accomodating, friendly, and helpful.  moreover, her home was clean, spacious,  beautifully decorated and detailed, and in a great part of san francisco, noe valley, which is a quiet residential section that has markets, restaurants, and some shopping all within close proximity.  i highly recommend jessica and her accomodations to future airbnb users.the house was very nice and just as described.  it was newly renovated/restored and move-in ready.  kitchen was fully stocked with equipment/cookwear and utensils.  entire house was clean and attractive.  the neighborhood was great, lots of activity within walking distance and easy to get to anywhere in the city.  jessica personally and charmingly welcomed us to her beautiful home, showed us where everything was, and pointed us in the direction of the nearest and best restaurants. she was immediately responsive and attentive to our (very few) queries. we were very appreciative of the detailed listing, as it really helped us to choose the accommodation best suited to us. the neighbourhood is quiet, with a real community feel, yet close to mission and castro, and bart for trips further afield.  it\\'s a beautifully renovated 1885 house, comfortable, calm, clean, quiet and full of light. perfect for us to recover from jetlag and hours of sightseeing, and not the place for people who want to party. if you love high ceilings, polished wood floors, graciously proportioned rooms, peace and tranquility, then this is the house for you. it\\'s infinitely more beguiling than the average impersonal holiday let. we wanted to experience the real san francisco, and staying in jessica\\'s home was a privilege.this lovely victorian home looks just like it does in the photos.  it was beautiful, colorful, peaceful, and full of light.  also it was a roomy house that worked perfectly for the 6 of us--a family of 4 with two teens, and grandparents.   the house was spotless when we arrived and was ready for us with all the necessary ammenities; such as coffee, toilet paper, and anything one might need in a kitchen.  a bonus is also the private garden out back which is also lush and full of bloom.  the location is amazing and easy to walk to noe valley, dolores park, the mission, the castro, and so close to all the major transportation.  jessica introduced herself at the beginning of our stay and gave us a chance to ask her any questions.  as well she left an extensive list of house policies and rules, as well as helpful suggestions about dining in the neighborhood and beyond.  throughout our stay she was communicative and responsive if we had anything that came up.  we would definitely stay here again...  i booked on behalf of a group of colleagues. jessica was very responsive and patiently accommodated my requests to update the reservation. i did not stay in the property, but my colleagues reported that it was very clean and beautiful. \\r\\n\\r\\njessica was very concerned about the house rules. my colleagues shared that they didn\\'t feel totally relaxed for fear of breaking one of the rules. they were asked not to invite other members of our conference to the home for a drink or dinner. it\\'s clear jessica has put a lot of great work into the house and may not be at ease with the level of independence some other properties provide.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you are comfortable with the rules and don\\'t mind some restrictions, i would recommend this property.jessica graciously opened her home to some of my colleagues who were attending dreamforce 2014. as a fully virtual company, it\\'s important for the time we spend together to be comfortable and inviting, and her home proved to be just that. the noe valley location was also an easy trek to all of the moscone center craziness while still feeling like a retreat at the end of a busy conference day. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe home was beautiful, the location was great, and everything was comfortable and well appointed. jessica also made herself available and checked in to ask if we were in need of anything. i didnt stay here personally but i visited the house and got very good feedback from the people staying here. jessica have a super lovely house in a very good location. its easy to get around in the city and to find good food in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only negative i heard was that the people staying in the house felt a bit watched and overcontrolled of all the rules that were printed out and put into every room. of course jessica takes great pride and care of her living but they felt it went a bit to the extreme of being reminded of all the rules and information about every person staying in the house. everyone understood the house rules and totally understandable to follow them.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall a great place to stay and can be recommended to others.the house was beautiful – a really gorgeous restoration of a classic san franciscan home. jessica, understandably, is very particular about her home and she stays downstairs in quite close proximity, so you really feel more like a guest of her house and sometimes it can feel hard to relax and really settle in. in saying this, it was very clean, in a fantastic location and well looked after. thanks for accommodating our team!jessica was a gracious host! we really felt welcome in her home. she made sure that our stay was comfortable and that we had everything we could possibly need. she thought of everything. her home is so lovely! all the rooms were very clean and the beds were very comfortable. i must say that i am very picky when it comes to the bed i\\'m sleeping in when i travel but my bed here is just perfect! she made it easy for us to settle in. she also gave us some good advice on places to go to. their house has everything you need - well equipped, perfect location, very clean and tidy. would thoroughly recommend this listing to any of my friends and intend to stay here again when i come back to sf. jessica was a responsive and adaptable host.  the gorgeous home is in immaculate condition.  the neighborhood is our favorite, steps from j muni train and bart, 24th street shopping and amazing variety of excellent restaurants.fantastic location in a great neighborhood. 5mn walk to the bart station. very convenient for the four of us since we were working downtown for a week. lot\\'s of restaurants near-by.\\r\\nthe house is in the vicinity of the mission district, that despite some gentrification, seems to keep its spirit. i love the murals there.jessica\\'s home was lovely and very clean and neat.  check-in and check-out were very easy. she is the perfect hostess and we really enjoyed our stay. jessica has a wonderful personality and is a lot of fun.  chatting with her enhanced our vacation.  she is extremely organized as well, and left literature for us describing restaurants and other activities.  we will rent from jessica during our next stay in san francisco. \\r\\n\\r\\none of the things we really appreciate about jessica is her commitment to maintaining her property, by imposing \"common sense\" rules.  it was very refreshing and is the reason why her home is so lovely and comfortable for travelers.  \\r\\n\\r\\ncheers! jessica was so quick and responsive when i was booking the house for my colleagues. since i did not physically stay at the house, my colleagues did tell me that the house is beautiful and cozy - great place to unwind and relax. jessica\\'s house is beautiful, spacious, well-equipped, and immaculately clean. our team of five had a great visit to san francisco, the house was convenient and had everything we needed. communication with jessica was abundant and effortless. excellent experience. jessica, the home owner, has a lovely home that is clean and well maintained, and the care that she puts into it makes it a very special place to stay. we do agree, however, with a previous reviewer that we felt we were being watched by jessica who lives in the basement apartment when she is renting out her house.  we had a misunderstanding with jessica about the rules and we made an honest mistake allowing an unapproved close friend to stay over for a couple of nights.  jessica confronted us about it in a manner that made us feel uncomfortable and frankly unwelcome. we acknowledge that we broke a rule but the situation seemed unnecessarily tense. the bottom line is, while it is a beautiful house in a pleasant neighborhood, you should only stay here if you able to strictly follow the numerous rules that are set forth in most rooms of the house.beautiful, spacious home in a great neighborhood and a perfect location for our family.  our host is a very proud homeowner and expects the same from her guests.  \\r\\nwe were very comfortable and enjoyed our time in her home.   we would definitely stay there again.\\r\\n  we were in sf for business. i and my 2 colleagues had a wonderful time at jessica\\'s house. the house is extremely well located and beautiful. very comfortable, charming and we felt like home. jessica was very helpful and we certainly recommend her house to anyone. emmanuelle jessica is a great host! she was very communicative throughout the reservation process to made sure that my colleagues and i were well taken care of and aware of the home. the home is just as pictured, clean, and in a safe area. jessica was a wonderful host! we booked very last minute and she was more than happy to accommodate. she was very responsive and timely with her replies. she arranged an easy key exchange and the house was beautiful. it is perfect for a group of family! we\\'d love to stay with jessica again in the future!everything worked out very well.  the house is very well taken care of and a beautiful victorian.  very close to bart and easy to  commute in the city.  \\r\\n\\r\\n contrary to many other posts about the host being overbearing, she was around whenever we needed her but we did not feel as if she was watching over us.  very nice house.  beautiful bathrooms and master bedrooms.  two smaller beds in guest room are on cots, and were not super comfortable, but fine for kids or for us for 3 nights.  jessica\\'s home is beautiful - providing for an authentic sanfran victorian style home experience.  all communication with jessica was easy, responsive and considerate.  my colleagues and i were traveling to sf for work - and we appreciated having a comfortable, spacious and gorgeous place to come back to rest after our long days. beautiful, spacious house in a safe, pleasant neighbourhood. we had a great time here.\\r\\n\\r\\nclean and plenty of great amenities. \\r\\n\\r\\nthere is no washing machine, however, which is a minor inconvenience (but you can use plenty of laundry shops nearby or an on-demand service like washio).\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is a great airbnb! the house is beautiful, spacious and immaculately maintained. the location is also great - on a quiet street but a short walk to the buzz of the mission.\\r\\n\\r\\njessica was a fantastic, welcoming and attentive host. she was very accommodating and made our stay extremely easy - thanks!great and welcoming host. really helpful will last minute request. beautiful and well preserved mansion with lots of space in one of the best neighborhoods in sf.jessica is a wonderful and welcoming host. my colleagues and i have stayed at jessica\\'s house on several occasions when we have been in town for business. it\\'s always our first choice when looking for somewhere to stay in san francisco.\\r\\nthe house is very well maintained, just as the pictures shows and located in a very nice neighborhood. makes you feel home away from home when coming back after a long day.beautiful home and great location. would definitely stay again!she is very friendlyjessica\\'s house is very beautiful and super clean. the photos are very accurate. jessica has gone a long way to keep her property very well maintained. wonderful house, great area and it\\'s quiet, no disturbing traffic or so. stayed for a week for a convention in sf.jessica has a beautiful home!  my colleagues and i had a great experience booking with jessica.  lovely home in great neighborhood, definitely met our needs.  will book again if the opportunity arises.jessica was an amazing host, and her home was beautiful and and perfectly situated for exploring san francisco. jessica was a fantastic host and has an incredible place! our guests were flown in from ny to perform at sfmoma\\'s art bash party and so it was important that they stay in a place that was elegant and comfortable and they absolutely loved it! the house is very beautiful and the location is perfect, right by the mission district. jessica welcomed us as we came, went through all the rules of the house with us, which are many,, but understandable since it is an old house, and let us enjoy our time in sf. jessica was more than willing to help always.  she allowed us to check-in a few hours early, which was immensely helpful after a 15 hour flight.  on the day of our departure, she was again helpful by storing our luggage for a few hours till we were ready to collect those and head off to the airport.  \\r\\n\\r\\njessica\\'s house is beautiful.  it is situated in a wonderful neighbourhood with easy access to public transport, and multiple fine places to dine out.  the house itself is clean and well-maintained.  stephanie was a great host. very friendly, good conversation, and ensured all our needs were met. very cute apartment and comfortable room :) will definitely keep an eye out for this listing next time i\\'m in sf.stephanie, and her bf stephen were great hosts and made my stay very easy and comfortable. \\r\\ncommunication prior to the stay was very clear and responsive. when i arrived, stephen received me at the door and helped me with my luggage upstairs. i had a very comfy room to myself, equipped with a fan and an air purifier. i shared the shower with hosts, but had my own toilet/sink downstair, which made my morning getting ready/makeup time very easy. \\r\\nwifi signal was strong; filtered water in the fridge; clean apartment; convenient location with supermarket/pharmacy within walking distance. what else can you ask for? \\r\\noh, did i forget to mention that they have a really cute bunny? :)\\r\\n\\r\\ni will definitely book their listing again next time when i\\'m in sf. and the hosts already have my invitation to stay with me in beijing the next time they visit. glad to have made new friends!stephanie and stephen were both super nice and accommodating. they are extremely clean and well kept and were in communication the entire time during my stay. the room has an air conditioner and air purifier and the bed was really comfortable despite the fact that i\\'m 6\\' 5\\'\\' ! would definitely be checking this place out again for work related trips in the soma neighborhood.stephanie and stephen welcomed me and gave me the tour when i got in, even though it was after 11p.  they let me pet the bunny.\\r\\n\\r\\ni even left my wallet their when i was leaving and had to come back to get it.  very helpful about everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe air purifier for moving air and white noise was a thoughtful touch.the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.stayed with james for a weekend night when i was going out with friends. his home is lovely – lots of light and a wonderful atmosphere.  that night he was hosting a paella cooking class for a group (he mentioned this before i stayed to make sure i was ok with this). i joined the group for a glass of wine and some mingling before i had to leave to meet my friends. a very nice way to start my evening, and the food looked wonderful (i wish i could have stayed!). \\r\\n\\r\\njames was very pleasant and a great host. he knows san francisco (and its restaurants and bars) very well. he gave me some great recommendations to try with my friends. the room was very comfortable, and i had a really nice stay. would highly recommend – especially for travelers who are not as familiar with the city. james can provide some great ideas for food, drinks and things to do. \\r\\njames--awesome!\\r\\nneighborhood--awesome! (lots of cute shops and places to eat)\\r\\nroom/house--awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\njames was a wonderful host! he was extremely helpful--open to questions and recommending restaurants to go to, etc--in-person and via phone/text. in the mornings, if we encountered each other, he always offered coffee. the place was immaculate and he even washed my towels a couple days into my stay. as someone with really high standards for cleanliness, i really appreciated this. i also really appreciated his mindfulness about sharing the space (i.e. we shared the shower/bathroom but i felt i was the only one using it). i really couldn\\'t have asked for a better airbnb experience. the room was cozy and had everything i needed.  a very comfortable bed with lots of good pillows.  an iron and ironing board were very useful since i was attending some business meetings.  \\r\\njames was very friendly and showed me how he prepared dinners for executives, which is his business.  i learned some things about cooking from him and it was nice to sit around for a while after a long day and talk with him.  the location is safe and quiet and felt like home.  the bathroom was updated and clean, as was the entire house.  james takes a lot of pride in his home and it shows.this is one of the best places to stay in sf if you appreciate a comfortable, elegant room and good food. james is an excellent host who made my stay very enjoyable. i highly recommend this place. in addition, if you want to cook better book one of james cooking classes. we had a great stay at james\\'place. the room is very comfy. the place is ideally located near haight-ashbury which is right in the middle of the city.we had a wonderful time staying at james\\' home. the rom was great and the bed was wonderful. james was a great host. we were able to spend a few minutes with him prior to a dinner party that he was conducting. he provided some great suggestions for dinner. the location was very convenient for us as it was only a few blocks from my wife\\'s daughters and the entrance to golden gate park. we were able to spend some time upon returning visiting with james and hope to be able to stay with he him again when we return to the city.staying with james was terrific. i enjoyed the whole stay.  his condo is amazing with an amazing location near many great san francisco sites.  james was a terrific host and i ended up hanging out with him several times a day just to chat.\\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend staying at this location and with james.  i\\'ll be sure to stay with him again.we had a lovely one night stay at james\\' flat. he was there to invite us in and give excellence dinner recommendations. the flat was a great location for walking around with a lot to do and see nearby. the bedroom was in the back of his home and very quiet.  thank you james!great stay, but too brief!  james was very helpful and welcoming.  his home is gorgeous and is in impeccable condition.  very relaxing, with good access to walks, hikes, shopping and restaurants on haight.  james was very responsive, and everything worked well.  i\\'ll be back. james was very welcoming and even though he was busy preparing for dinner guests he took the time to show me around and i didn\\'t feel rushed at all. there was water in the room, wifi access details, etc. all well prepared and ready for my arrival. \\r\\n\\r\\njames has a beautiful home that\\'s really to my taste and the bed is by far one of the comfiest i have had the pleasure of sleeping in.\\r\\n\\r\\njames is a really interesting guy and i wish that i had had more time to share a glass of wine (or two!) with him. next time i am in san francisco i will not hesitate to stay with james again.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally, james\\' condo is perfectly located for the golden gate park (beautiful botanical gardens.. they\\'ve even got buffalo grazing there!) and there\\'s quite a nice bohemian feel to the bars and cafes just one block down.james is an incredible host. i felt at home right away. he was very patient with my late arrival. his home is warm and welcoming and the bed was very comfortable. i felt like i was at the home of a friend.\\r\\nthe neighborhood is beautiful. i wish i had more time to explore it. i had no trouble getting to places from there. it also feels very safe.\\r\\nelegant room, comfortable bed and great sunlight in the late afternoon evenings to read in the chair and enjoy a glass of wine. very friendly and helpful with fun things to do around the city! great host, friendly, and fun to chat with! if he has a cooking class you\\'re free to enjoy a glass of wine and mingle with the guests. i stayed for 3 weeks for a work trip, and the place was cleaned after cooking classes and once a week with a cleaning lady/housekeeper. much better than staying in a hotel, because it felt like home instead of a hotel. i didn\\'t expect to become friends with my host, but i did. if you\\'re looking for a nice, quiet place to stay definitely book this place!could not have asked for a better host and stay! james was very welcoming and gracious,  knowledgeable of the amazing historic area surrounding his gorgeous flat. i could summon the grateful dead with ease!! if and when i make it back to his wonderful city, i will be staying again!

 super sweet people; very responsive to requests/texts. offered advice about nearby places to get coffee and other things to do, willing to explain the muni system. very cool room; the projector was a beautiful touch! nice to relax and watch movies after a day of exploring. thanks again!this place is lovely and organized. very quiet neighborhood and friendly homeowner. you get to use the projector and a mini bar. the yard is pretty awesome. we did not have time use the campfire because we spent most time in downtown, but it would be nice to sit by the fire and enjoy the day in the yard.  this place was awesome, it was exactly as described in an awesome neighborhood with plenty of parking. lot\\'s of yummy asian restaurants near by. kana was incredibly accommodating especially since i showed way later than originally intended. there was a little lack of communication when we first arrived but it really didn\\'t impair our stay what so ever. the projector was great. he was such a great host, replied fairly quickly to most of messages, gave us the privacy i was looking for, and even recommended a great local coffee place.the host was very responsive to text messages and willing to explain anything. was really nice and was there to receive us when we arrived at checkin. explained everything once we arrived and showed us everything personally. the room was tidy and clean, and had clean linens. we had extra people so the extra air mattress was required, and was setup before we arrived. loved the private entrance and access to the backyard. host was very respectful of privacy and available if we needed anything. \\r\\nhad our own car, so didn\\'t need to use public transport, but neighborhood was quiet and parking was easy. close to the ocean and close to some cute restaurants and shops. the projector was a nice touch and great to have after exploring the city all day. thanks for a great experience!  the room\\'s scenery was great and really spacious. above all he was a great host for us! the one thing you should notice is that you should bring your shampoo and body wash~ \\np.s. transportation muni is really convenient! we were totally pleased with our four nights in this room and with the support by the host. the room was large & cleaned, with our own private entrance. we had a rental car and our location allowed us to access different parts of the bay area each day. parking on the street with sample and easy. on clear days, beautiful sunsets where available a short walk to the beach. an extra bonus was the projection tv/sound system available to us each evening. i\\'m talking \"big screen\". the host was available when needed, otherwise we were politely left alone. more than satisfied!the door has welcome airbnb sign, which is cute. and we can play the board.our host provided us with the information we needed to get into our room at the appropriate time. our host responded to me timely when i texted him. i did not have the opportunity to meet the host in person. \\r\\nthe room was as listed - a large private room, the bed was comfortable. i would suggest to the host that he mow the lawn, clean out the refrigerator, replace the carpet, have a mat in the bathroom, provide enough toilet paper and fix the dripping shower. \\r\\none of the things that attracted me to the room was the outdoor area. however when we arrived (and throughout our stay) the backyard was so overgrown and unkempt that we never were able to enjoy it. \\r\\ni would also suggest a coffee maker and/or microwave for the convenience of the guests. there is a perfect spot for that there and it would be an easy inexpensive asset. also some nice smelling candles or oils would go a long way as this is a basement room and smells a bit musty. this may sound like a lot to ask for the price of the room but by the time we paid in full for the room (there were 4 of us so we paid more than the listed price and there is a cleaning fee) it was $200/night.  \\r\\nnice location with easy access to downtown.    ken was kind and responsive to our communication. the place was as appears and their is private entrant and free street parking. quick to get to the muni stop, but not a lot to do in the area. the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.it was a nice, clean and spacious room close to the beach and public transport. kana left clear instructions and we had a very nice stay!the place is in a quite area with public transportation only 2 blocks away. the room has its own entrance and own bathroom. easy parking on the street. the host is very nice and easy to communicate with. big plus: the entertainment system and the beach down the street. very nice host. the room is spacious, we were 3 and had space. the air matress is comfortable too. not close from the city center but well deserved by the fast tramway and buses. \\r\\nwe stayed 8 nights there and  could wash our clothes. we really enjoyed the garden! great place to stay at for a family with car that want to explore sf and bay area. easy to get on highway 1, golden gate, palo alto and city center. a bit chilly and foggy, but cozy and calm neighbourhood. lovely breakfast at devil\\'s teeth bakery and dinner with beers at  sunset reservoir brewery, which both were recommendations from our hostmy husband and i had a wonderful stay. absolutely love the neighborhood. makes you feel very safe. public transportation just down the street. wonderful location. very quiet. we loved the room as well. very private. has everything we needed nice and quiet neighborhood by the beach. the location is great, especially if you have a car. the room is spacious with backyard access. we had an amazing experience. the house was so lovey and everything it promised to be! walks to the beach and to chestnut and union streets were ideal. our family also loved hanging in the bright, sunny and comfy living room in the morning and evenings. thank you so much for having us!  this home is not suitable for young children. there are 2 tall flights of stairs that are not carpeted and you cannot secure either staircase with a baby gate. more importantly, the windows do not have child safety guards or even screens so you cannot open any windows for fresh air and there is no a/c so you do need to open the windows. the house itself would be nice for adults and older children but it would have been more comfortable if the owner had moved her personal belongings to make room in the closets and refrigerator for our things. we found a dirty towel hanging in the bathroom and a stain on one of the comforters so that was also a little uncomfortable. the deck with a distant, partial view of alcatraz is on the roof which is one flight up through the master bedroom, a very small area and a little scary to walk up to. it\\'s not an area that is easy accessible or safe for kids. ultimately, we couldn\\'t stay at the house because of the safety issues for our 2-year-old. for the right people, this house would work and it\\'s a nice house but it\\'s not suitable for a family with children. crystal was extremely accommodating and lovely to work with. her home was gorgeous and perfect for our out-of-town team members. i\\'d highly recommend her home for families and small groups. her house has everything you need and more. crystals home was beautiful and in such a nice location in the marina.  a quiet street close to the water.  it was decorated to have a cozy homey feel and lots of space to spread out. gorgeous home in ideal sf location near marina/wharf.  we were four business colleagues in town for work. nice collection of restaurants and bars within walking distance (really good indian at lasan). morning runs along chrissy fields worked out nicely. home has beautiful rooftop deck views of gg, alcatraz. crystal was super easy to work with. her home is very inviting. i\\'d stay here in a heartbeat with my own family (ie, vacation). in fact, if i had some extra $$ laying around i\\'d put in an offer on the place..ha! my colleagues and i will also look into this arrangement again when we all travel to sf at the same time.  it worked out really well for us.  accessible by public transportation, but in sf uber should be your friend.this home is as-advertised-- very spacious, clean and in a nice quiet neighborhood.  the location is great.  we easily caught the bus and toured around town all weekend. our group ranged in age from 7 to 75 and crystal\\'s home suited us all quite well.  we had a fun long weekend in san francisco and we would definitely recommend staying here.\\r\\n what a wonderful home, with a great kitchen, lots of light and warmth. we loved our stay and the location simply unbeatable. thank you crystalgreat house! bright sunny rooms! beautiful interior design, wonderful art on the walls, comfortable & full equiped kitchen, gorgeous shower, best roof terrace ever! \\nthe area is lovely, walking  distance to nice shops & restaurants \\ncrystal was very helpful and answered right away all our questions or requests \\nwe would repeat any time, we felt at homewe had a wonderful time in san francisco and crystal\\'s house was perfect for our two families.  the house is very cozy while spacious and is in an amazing location where you can easily walk or uber to shopping or restaurants.  i highly recommend this house for anyone wanting to create memories of san fran.i had booked a house through airbnb for myself & 7 friends to be in san francisco for the super bowl weekend, all arrangements were made months ahead and we hyped for a fun weekend. before boarding our flight to san francisco i attempted to contact our hostess to confirm our booking and i was shocked to find out our hostess cancelled. so here we were on the busiest weekend of the year, stranded with no place to stay and not very happy with the situation.. i was assured by aubrey at airbnb that they would find us a place to stay, we were very frustrated and thought our plans would be ruined, however it turned out aubrey was able to find us a super hostess michele that offered her house to us within a couple of hours arriving in san francisco. michele was very welcoming and gracious when we arrived at her house. it was a load of my mind, what could have been a horrible super bowl weekend turned out to be a great experience thanks to aubrey from airbnb and our amazing hostess michele who saved our weekend. the next morning after we arrived in san francisco michele called me and asked if we needed anything or if she could help in any way, i told her everything was good and just thanked her again for what she did for us on such short notice..\\r\\n\\r\\nbal gillmichele was a fantastic host. here beautiful house was clean and i think is actually nicer and larger than it appears in the photos. michele set out snacks for us which was a very nice touch! the view from the twin peaks area is amazing - a different view of san francisco then i had ever seen before. we rented a car and it worked out great to get to the moscone center each morning - no problem.michele was lovely and so very accommodating to our guests, who were all from rural georgia and had never been to san francisco. she was one of the first people they met after getting off the plane, and she made them feel right at home by checking them in personally and providing lots of yummy snacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe would absolutely stay here again and i highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a peaceful and relaxing trip.michelle is such a gracious host. she ensured that we have all that we need, and that we won\\'t get hungry. we appreciate the food that she so generously bought for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nher house is very nice: with great spaces, clean and complete with stuff that made our stay really comfortable and convenient.michele was a great host, and the house was perfect, especially for a bigger group of people.  victor is a very conscientious host, and very responsive.  the home itself is beautiful and very conveniently located in terms of transportation, entertainment, groceries, etc.  i\\'d recommend victor and his property to anyone!wonderful place and fantastic hosts!! quality everything and incredibly comfortable!i had a lovely few nights at stephanie\\'s place. it\\'s neatly tucked away from the noise of the main road, was clean and comfortable, and wonderfully located. most importantly of all, stephanie was a caring, attentive host who went to great lengths to ensure a wonderful stay. i\\'d love to go back sometime.stephanie and tom were amazing hosts! they have a beautiful unit that is fully stocked, clean, secure and comfortable. they offered great recommendations throughout my stay with them. one morning we hung out and they made me a breakfast and coffee while we chatted about their experiences living in san francisco. they even offered to drive me to heath ceramics on their way to run errands that day!\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is definitely my favorite and best experience staying at an airbnb so far, made great by stephanie and tom\\'s hospitality. we thoroughly enjoyed our brief but comfortable stay with stephanie. she was extremely accommodating and was very thoughtful about communicating with us to make sure we didn\\'t encounter any problems. the listing was very accurate and a very comfortable place to stay. my wife and i only stayed one hectic night but we would have loved to have stayed much longer, especially to get to know stephanie and her husband better. check-in was simple and easy, and they even accommodating our last minute request for a later check-out. we would definitely like to stay here again next time we visit san francisco.stephanie\\'s place is fantastic. don\\'t be fooled by the slightly unorthodox booking experience, i couldn\\'t recommend staying here enough for any of your san francisco needs.great safe location and loved the holiday lights. stephanie was extremely easy and communicative. also easy access from the bart with only a 25 min ride to/from sfo. love san fran and would stay here again. stephanie was the best airbnb host i ever had - even though she happened to be overseas during my entire stay! she was still available around the clock and checked in a few times throughout my week-long stay to make sure i was taken care of. she was also very knowledgable about the area, which is always a huge plus.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room itself was immaculate and comfortable and the house is very warm/welcoming. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall i give this listing a 10/10 and will definitely be staying here every time i\\'m in sf. perfect location and wonderful host. stephanie was very responsive to our inquiries and very accommodating too.  the place itself is clean and elegant, with all the necessary amenities and toiletries. i would highly recommend this place to anyone who want to stay in the mission neighborhood. stephanie was a fantastic host very helpful and welcoming unfortunately didn\\'t  get to meet tom as he was away but anyone who likes rugby and cricket has impeccable taste.  location was fantastic a two minute walk to bart and about 10 min to downtown san francisco which makes it easy to return home during the day and head back out. the unit was very clean, comfortable, safe and had everything you could need. stephanie was a wonderful host. she and tom were attentive to our needs, friendly and warm, and happy to help us with questions about sightseeing, dinner reservations, etc.\\r\\nwe actually stayed in their in-law apartment behind the house (rather than the bedroom in the house) as stephanie graciously offered the substitution as an option due to renovations going on in the house. the apartment was delightful, spacious, very clean and attractive - it was a terrific place for us to stay for 5 nights. we would love to come back again.what a great place to stay in san francisco! personally, i prefer the neighborhoods of noe valley and the mission and stephanie\\'s place is in an ideal location. there\\'s lots to see and do within easy walking distance or you can hop onto bart which is only a block away. it\\'s clean, comfortable, and stephanie is the ideal host: accessible but not intrusive. i travel to sf for work quite frequently and this will definitely be my first choice for return visits. beats a hotel for sure.\\r\\n\\r\\npros: location, beautiful space with lots of light, stocked kitchen, updated and clean bathroom with good towels and products, comfortable bed, wifi, great hosts!\\r\\n\\r\\ncons: the street is a tad noisy, but i\\'m used to that so it didn\\'t bother me at all, and stephanie gives you earplugs if you need \\'em!\\r\\n\\r\\nnote: i actually stayed in the private one bedroom unit which has it\\'s own entrance.  stephanie was amazing from the first message i sent her to my departure from her wonderful in-law studio. she answered my questions promptly, allowing me to book the studio quickly, and she streamlined my arrival, getting in contact with me in advance to let me know how to get in. unfortunately, i spent most of my time in san francisco out exploring so i didn\\'t get to meet stephanie, but i had the opportunity to meet tom early morning after his bike ride and he was very welcoming. the studio itself was very clean, modern, and cozy - i would definitely stay here again! it\\'s in a very convenient location with plenty of trendy restaurants with local flavor, and super convenient transportation. i brought my car with me, and was able to find street parking without too much trouble. i stayed four nights at stephanie and i have to say i had some of the best sleeps in my life there. the bed was super comfortable and the unit is on a quiet street. the kitchen was very well equipped with everything you need should you want to make some food for yourself. the whole unit was very clean, and will furnished. the location is great, the bart station is just two minutes away and there\\'s a bunch of restaurants and independent grocery stores all around.\\nunfortunately, due to our busy schedule i didn\\'t have the chance to meet stephanie in person, but she was very easy to contact and communicate with via airbnb. i definitely recommend her.loved the place, the neighborhood, stephanie\\'s flexibility, and the bed was sooooo comfy and the sheets were sooooooo soft :)\\nstephanie\\'s home was a perfect way to spend an extra-long weekend in sf. the mission location is spot-on, right in the middle of the action but just out of the way enough to be a welcome reprieve after a long day of sightseeing or bar-hopping or restaurant-perusing. stephanie had plenty of tips and even offered us free tickets to a museum. she was in constant contact when we needed it but not over-bearing, and she was able to make us feel very much as home.this was our first air b&b experience and it could not have been better. excellent communication from stephanie from the word go, answering  any enquires i had very quickly. the room itself was fab, just what we needed. it\\'s location was also really great being so close to the bart made getting around cheap and easy. \\nunfortunately we never got to meet stephanie during our stay, but she was always just at the end of the phone if needed.  we did however meet tom and the furry friends who welcomed us warmly. if we were travelling to san francisco again we would definitely book to stay at stephanie and tom\\'s again without a moment of hesitation. fantastic experience. the apartment is very clean, well-lit, and accurately described on the page. perfect location with a lot of great restaurants, bars, cafes, and shopping nearby, and just a block and half away from bart. stephanie and tom were welcoming and incredibly responsive and offered my sister and me a lot of suggestions for places to go and eat. one of the best airbnb experiences i\\'ve ever had!stephanie\\'s place is spacious, clean, well-equipped and well-located. i had a great time and i\\'d definitely stay again.i took the bart in from the airport. this is a great location, easy to get in and out of. stephanie was very helpful and quick to respond. the space was comfy and clean. i only stayed for one night, but i would definitely recommend this spot. thanks for a cozy spot to stay!there is amazing place.\\ni had great time in sf.\\neverything is near here and you dont need worry about your travel.\\nheigo is verrry nice and has humour!\\nthanx to stay there and i want back there soooon.\\ni will use mountain view´s too!\\n\\n良い場所過ぎるくらい良いところです。\\n必要なものは全部揃ってるし、どこにいくにも近いです!\\nどういって良いかわからないくらいだけど、とにかくサンフランシスコになにかしにいくのならベストな場所です!i had a really good time ! really recommededheigo was great, very friendly and helpful. the apartment was fantastic and clean. i would stay here again! the flat is pretty amazing. you will live in the center of san francisco, walgreens is around the corner on market street and the view from the flat is magnificent. you can wash your clothes and prepare a good food there. yes, you will sleep on a bunk bed with another three persons in your room and sometimes 8 people occupy the flat (there is another room for 4 persons in the flat). but if can go with that, take this place. heigo was extremely nice and interesting to talk to. he\\'s extremely organized with the different guests, he\\'s very patient and always made sure i wasent having any trouble! heigo\\'s place is clean, comfortable, and tidy. you can cook a quick meal with the accumulation of food left over from previous guests and/or go to the gym in the building. the central location allows you to walk to most places downtown. during my stay, heigo visited a few times to make sure everything and everyone is good - i appreciated his hospitality and attentiveness!heigo\\'s (sensitive contents hidden)plus pic is a piano- but in reality heigo is a rockstar in awesomeness and a orchestra conductor in his good taste all rolled into one!\\r\\n\\r\\ni was nervous about using airbnb as it was my first time but i totally enjoyed my stay and will happily use airbnb again and again.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is very tastefully decorated and though 4 bunk beds to a room- it is very comfortable and friendly and there is washer, iron and equipped kitchen and fridge for guests to use and quite clean- and the building is totally awesome and there is a gym too.\\r\\n\\r\\nmost of all the fellow guests were awesome- educated, from tech entrepreneur to law-school guy to techies from europe to a pair of bankers who were us airforce reserve guys- all from different countries including parts of usa.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighnorhood is very central- walking distance from bart even with super-heavy bags and reasonably good in facilities and walking distance from many landmarks and town-center.\\r\\n\\r\\nheigo ofcourse is a rockstar- who asked when i\\'ll be there- and kept waiting for over a hour in building reception to welcome me as i wandered thru streets- also his taste and professionalism is impeccable- managing many airbnb properties he really does things very well and he too is a 20-something tech buff as his taste in books shows!\\r\\n\\r\\nmany nice bars, coffee-shops, pizza and clubs nearby- within 50 metres of building.\\r\\n\\r\\nofcourse, sfo has many homeless, street-trash everywhere- but my experience was all awesome- and everyone who sees building from outside was super impressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy compliments once again to heigo and looky on awesome interior decoration and good taste in furnishings and kitchenware.\\r\\n\\r\\ni wish heigo all the best and hope to use his airbnb again someday-- and yes, if heigo is ever in my country or if i bump into him in usa- i will surely buy him a coffee or a drink as a matter of thanks!!! \\r\\nheigo was a great host. he did a good job decorating the place. it\\'s clean and homey. you would have young professionals as your roommates to chat with. i was a light sleeper but all of my roommates were very quite. heigo is an excellent host. this was my first airbnb experience and was very fortunate that it was an enjoyable one. heigo is attentive and really makes sure you have everything you need. i look forward to staying here again next time i visit san francisco.great place! heigo was extremely welcoming and friendly. area is in a pretty convenient place of town. super friendly and helpful host.  really nice and clean space w a great view.  wonderful experience booking via airbnb, it is my first time traveling staying not in hotels, gatz is a super nice person and department located in downtown, very clean and better than hotel i think, no need tips like hotel. if you are traveling with other friends for more than three days, that will i strongly recommend you stay here. heigo is a fantastic host who truly wants his guests to be well taken care of!the apartment was clean and modern, and soma was a short walk from the mission and other nightlife. heigo was a fantastic host and i will definitely be staying with looky homes next time i visit sf!everything was easy and as expected. i had a great time.gatz was amazing. a+ host and should be a role model for other airbnb hosts. communication was always the whole way and did everything to accommodate. my cousin was visiting from china and needed to stay in the city for convenience. the location is perfect. couple of steps from the bart station. i will definitely recommend this place to everyone in the future.looky home is a fantastic place. very clean, comfortable, modern apartment. the shared apartment concept is very innovative, and i got to meet some really great people on my trip as a result. gatz was very communicative and does a great job matching up people from diverse backgrounds at looky home. \\r\\n\\r\\nexcellent experience, would definitely recommend. gatz has a great place - another time will be even better, i am certain!i had a good 5 day stay here. great location and trendy apartment building. clean and very well organized common spaces. plenty of room for everyone\\'s stuff and hanging out. great internet. gatz was accessible and addressed any concerns. i also enjoyed my fellow apartment mates, all young and interesting people. i would stay here again, but might opt for a place with less people in one room because i\\'m a light sleeper and snoring kept me up some nights even with ear plugs in.  i rented this apartment for a few interns that needed a place to stay before their apartment leases started in june. from what i heard, everything was as described. they felt welcomed, safe and comfortable. overall, they had a great experience.  the listing was highly accurate and in a very convenient location. the host was fantastic and regularly checked in on the apartment. overall, this exceeded my expectations and was an excellent experience!i truly enjoyed my stay and was sad to leave. while i only spoke to heigo one time, i have a good impression. what made my stay great: my interaction with my roommates (caitlin, darryl, kumarand, linyoa, takeishi, etc.). i really loved talking to them in the evenings when i returned from my conference. what a great, friendly group of people. having them there made traveling less lonely. -- i slept well in my bunk bed and was able to get work done in the common area, though, do note, there are no private areas. \\r\\n 4 looky home soma is pristine. a truly modern, upscale apartment with new furniture, clean kitchen and bathroom, in-unit laundry, and a kitchen with all gadgets you need.\\r\\nif i stayed in sf again, i would stay here.looky home is an amazing home away from home. very friendly people and great locations. clean, well decorated, fun. truly enjoyed it and would definitely come again. had a great time at looky home soma, met a lot of great people, the place is cool, clean and equipped. \\r\\n\\r\\nfor sure i\\'d come back! epic experience. great time in the place. clean flat. great gym. great kitchen and great host. definitely would recommend it. my stay at alex\\'s place was great. the location was fantastic, check in was straight forward, the parking spot was a huge plus and the place itself was awesome. it made my stay in sf enjoyable.the rental is managed by pillow. the first contact with pillow was a little confusing because they send a text which ends with ..... and doesn\\'t let you know that they accept your booking, you find this information in the e-mail they send out too. \\r\\n\\r\\ni had problems when i arrived at the location because one of the bathrooms was locked. i contacted pillow and had somebody showing up 15 minutes later. great service, very professional! i also was fortunate to meet the owner. he was also very helpful and nice\\r\\na big plus is the garage since it is not easy to find parking.\\r\\nthe apartment has a good floorpan. kitchen with dining on one side, living on the other which is great if some would like to chill in the living room while the others are chatting in the kitchen/dining area. the dining area has a big table! \\r\\ni was not so impressed with the cleanliness which is partly due to the bathrooms being dated and showing some mold but it is also due to not having been cleaned good enough.  \\r\\nbedrooms and living room  were meticulous.\\r\\nwe really liked the neighborhood! great mix of little stores, bars, takeout, and a supermarket carrying mainly fresh organic foods. there are no bars nearby so the street is not noisy. \\r\\noverall i would rent the place again. \\r\\n the apartment was fantastic. great location. would highly recommend.the place was wonderful and as described. the house is charming and very neat. i would definitely recommend. thanks again alex!host was very accommodating both on arrival and departure. neighborhood was exactly as described.  great time! thanks for allowing us to stay! :)the hostess made us feel very welcome. she waited for us even though we were delayed a couple hours. her insights on getting around san francisco made the hsb festival a breeze.  the rooms were magnificent and the bed incredible. we slept the best we\\'ve slept in years. we will definitely be coming back again. thanks gena   i had a fantastic time staying there! i needed a place in san francisco immidiately and gena, art, and vicky were super effective arranging last minute accommodations. their house is beautiful and the room is very pretty and comfortable. people living in this house are amazing as well. everyone was very friendly and made me feel welcome. i truly felt like home and even didn\\'t want to leave in the end!  the house is also conveniently located in a historic neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops and public transportation. honestly, if this place is available, definitely book it and consider yourself lucky!the hosts vicky, art and jon made us feel at home in their home.  infact the host let us stay in his own room as his vacation was cancelled at the last minute and i messed up our previous reservation.  this trip was to celebrate my son\\'s 21st birthday and my own.  his dream was to stay in a victorian mansion.  this fulfilled that dream.  the house was full of period art and furnishing but had modern amenities like abundant lighting, a lovely chef\\'s kitchen and a bathroom with period ambience but modern function.  we were both very comfortable and happy.  vicky and art briefed us on the neighborhood which is historic haight ashbury.  it was fun to see where the \"summer of love\" started.  the neighborhood restaurants were actually some of our favorite even having the whole city to choose from.the house is just as fancy as the pictures suggest. the room i stayed in was quite large, and it\\'s in a cool neighborhood. and jon was a great host. would definitely stay againwhat a lovely house. so majestic. the room is much larger than i thought -- double the size of a typical sf bedroom. immaculately decorated. quiet. the fireplace is such a lovely touch. and the host - so gracious. thank you.  great house, very comfortable, very roomy.  we had six people and more than enough space.  there is plenty of street parking (though it\\'s at a steep slant!).  we took the bus from just three houses down and rode into the light rail/bus station, then took rail or bus into the city daily - it is a very easy routine with buses by the house every 30 minutes.  \\r\\nthe downstairs master suite had a lot of privacy, or you could just leave the door to the stairs open as we did.  \\r\\nall the amenities were in good condition.\\r\\njenny was great to work with and responsive.  she pushed two twin beds together for us so that our second adult couple would have something more like a king bed than two twins. \\r\\ni recommend this for families and groups, both with or without a car.fantastic! \\r\\n\\r\\ngreat facilities, true to the listing. a lovely quiet, safe and friendly neighbourhood perfect for families visiting sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nour host was really friendly and helpful, we felt very well looked after! \\r\\ncharlotte\\'s house was lovely. we felt very at home. everything was beautiful and clean when we arrived. her instructions were simple and we enjoyed many of the suggestions she gave for eating and shopping in her neighborhood. the area was walkable and close to so many of the fun things we did while visiting san francisco. our children had a great time too!client is very friendly and nice. the room is clean and beautiful. highly recommend! will\\'s apartment is a beautifully decorated home located in a nice neighborhood not far from the center of downtown. before even entering the apartment we meet a neighbor who welcomed us to san francisco and told us of growing up there and suggested things to do. by the time we left 8 days later we knew mo at the store down the hill and brandon at the new restaurant dat spot (try the ribs!), and every night on our walk back we visited vladimir the st. bernard. thinkers café has awesome coffee and various food items. although we left the neighborhood each day we still enjoyed all of the resources there in the morning and evening. often times we came back from downtown to eat near the apartment. buses are down the hill and will get you anywhere in the city. we did rent a car one day and there is parking available. the bed is the most comfortable i have slept on away  from home. the room is large enough for all of your things, has a desk you can use as a work area, closet for hanging clothes, laundry hamper provided. the wifi works well. we did not have a lot of questions but when we did will answered them quickly. the apartment has air conditioning which is rare in san francisco. it is also pristinely clean. getting in and out was no issue as there is a lock box. will and his wife were excellent hosts. we talked with them the first night and they helped us with muni information. we were never disturbed by their activities in the apartment at all. this was a great location to stay as you can come back to a quiet neighborhood after sightseeing during the day and get some rest. we were glad we stayed a few miles away from the downtown areas. a shuttle from the airport will drop you off right at the front door and they will also pick you up for your return flight. will & joana made us feel so welcome and made sure everything was taken care of. the accommodations were just as expected from the description. the location was great. all in all, a fabulous experience. recommend with enthusiasm. a great deal. absolutely perfect space  in every way - beautiful, clean, spacious, quiet. one of the most comfortable beds i\\'ve ever slept in anywhere.     \\r\\nwell located on beautiful street in an interesting, friendly neighborhood with super convenient access to anywhere you want to go.  will and joana are perfect hosts.  would book here again without question!will was very welcoming and his place is great. i was there for a very busy work trip, so didn\\'t get to spend too much time at will\\'s home, but it was perfect for my needs. will was very welcoming, the place has a comfortable bed and private bathroom. it was also really cool to check out all of the different artwork they have on their walls. highly recommend a stay with will.awesome!!! very very very very awesome!!!! hosts are simply incredible people: nice, friendly, helping and simply great. will and joana  met us, told us everything about neighborhood, gave good advices. amazing! and place is just amazing! if you like something very cozy, quite and art-like apartment - that\\'s it! room is great, terrace is very nice, everything was just amazing! neighborhood is one of the best in the city. near park with view on all city. small houses, friendly people, cozy cafes, awesome grocery. and walking distance to downtown. we had very very very great time there!!!! highly recommended!!! fantastic!  will and joanna are amazing hosts and there place is beautiful.  stayed there for two weeks and already have another week book with them for later this year!  quiet, clean room in a lovely home. hosts will and joanna were friendly and made us feel welcomed. it was a pleasure staying with them. will and joanna are great hosts. their home is beautiful and in the perfect location in potrero hill. the room is so comfortable and spacious and the private bathroom was perfect. we didn\\'t see each other much because i was working long hours, but they were super helpful, welcoming and friendly.awesome. stylish house, everything works perfectly. location is better than it seems. cafes and restaurants around are cozy. will is a great host. totally recommended.the host will was very pleasant, wonderful neighborhood (thinkers café) the café was a short walk with great breakfast and coffee very friendly. the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and neat, bed was comfortable and it was very quiet....except for my snoring!\\r\\nwe enjoyed out stay!funny story.  i booked will and joanna\\'s private room from monday to friday.  i booked everything else about attending 2016 bio including my flight which arrived . . . sunday evening.  i\\'m ringing the doorbell, calling and texting will when i figured out the problem.  will was extremely gracious.  he informed me that the room was occupied and even followed up with a recommendation for another place to stay sunday night.  it was very helpful.  \\r\\non monday night, i met will and his wife joanna.  they are a wonderful couple.  the room and the bathroom were very nice, clean and functional.  i was quite busy with the conference, breakfast, lunch, and dinner meetings and receptions so i didn\\'t get to interact with will or joanna much.  and when i was all conferenced out, i spent a full day in the private room, catching up on work.  it was a very productive day.will is a really nice host.\\nhis flat is really nice too, very well located, just a few minutes away from public transports to the city center.\\nwe had a really nice time at will\\'s in san francisco !nilesh was very accomodating and easy to transact with.  his home is clean, bright and airy.  easy to find, and a nice location in san francisco, with easy access to north and east areas.  everything worked (showers, toilets, washer/dryer, heat) and for our 7 guests, was a perfect stay.greatly enjoyed our stay at nilesh\\'s lovely rowhouse in the outer sunset. the house was spotlessly clean, well-appointed, and tastefully decorated. i found the big open kitchen-dining area especially great—granite countertops, smooth-closing cabinets, gas range, all the pots and pans and crockery you might need for whipping up a meal... the beautiful and large garden was also a highlight.\\n\\nthe beds were very comfortable, though it is worth pointing out that one of the three bedrooms had a king mattress on the floor in addition to the full bed—that said, it was a very comfortable mattress! the wireless signal was strongest in the kitchen, so if you\\'re having trouble connecting, start there. \\n\\nthe location is just great: there\\'s a safeway just around the corner, and a fun (and very popular) little donut shop at the end of the street. the n line trolley is a couple of blocks up the road and goes right downtown. there is also plenty of on-street parking, and we never had trouble finding a spot during our four day stay. the house also has a garage and a driveway, although both those spots were taken during our stay—so if off-street parking is important for you, i\\'d recommend getting in touch with nilesh to arrange it beforehand. he was very communicative and quick to respond to messages before and during our stay. \\n\\noverall, if you\\'re looking for a comfortable, clean and quiet spot within easy reach of the city, i can highly recommend nilesh\\'s place!this place is amazing. close to the park and a safeway. beautiful home with great owners!!!lovely, bright, clean home in a great central neighbourhood,  welcoming hosts who provided lots of information.we really enjoyed our stay at adam and alex\\'s house.  they made an effort to make sure that we were comfortable and answered questions promptly.  i felt like i was visiting a friend\\'s house.  it was spacious and comfortable, but my favorite part of the property was the back deck.  it was amazing.  you also can\\'t beat the location.  it was a block away from haight and golden gate park.  muni light rail and bus were also a few blocks away.      we had a wonderful time in adam & alex\\'s house and fully enjoyed all 3 tastefully furnished and decorated bedrooms, the modern and functional 2.5 baths, the convenient office suite, the fast wireless internet, a gourmet chef\\'s professional kitchen, coffee sourced from exotic places, lg laundry facilities, a beautifully soothing backyard, and a nice piano that allowed us to play some chopin. the place is on a quiet street yet it is also convenient to everything, including whole foods 1 block away and some of the best cuisines in the world within walking distance or a short drive by car. the hosts were friendly, hospitable, accommodating, and very thoughtful. they allowed us to park in their own garage, despite the fact that the garage space was not part of the original rental. the whole trip felt like we were staying in our own house – just a much better house.a&a were an amazing host and house is amazing and in the perfect location. we ended-up very early in the morning and alex was very welcoming even thou we were early. the house is stocked with all amenities for both short and long stay. oh, did i mention the backyard? lamp heating, mood lighting, a water fountain! definitely would head back to this place the next time we will be in sf. a true 5 star experience.adam and alex are wonderful hosts we were welcomed into their house and made to feel at home. the home is lovely and light with wonderful decor. i found the area interesting and quite close to the city. i would highly recommend this house and of course its wonderful hosts.i work at a small nonprofit and was looking for a comfy, spacious, open, airy, zen-like space for a board retreat and boy did i find it! adam and alex\\'s home was the perfect place for our 10 person group to get to business and relax at the same time. it\\'s close to everything; parks, public transport, bars, bodegas, whole foods is less than a block away. most of our group is local but two flew in from the east coast and were very comfortable staying in the house. the kitchen is crazy-nice. everything was clean and comfortable. adam and alex were both very communicative and available. i got so many compliments from the board for finding such a perfect spot. board retreat success! i highly recommend.unfortunately despite the property being lovely, our stay was not as hassle free as we’d hoped. my group’s arrival went smoothly, and the hosts were initially quite flexible in our arrival times, but once we arrived things began to go downhill.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing that happened upon our arrival was that a car got broken into directly in front of the house. this isn’t the host’s fault but did give us serious doubts about the safety of the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nas we settled in, we noticed that the wifi was unbearably unreliable, a situation that the hosts were unable to resolve. since we were there for a tech conference, this was a serious problem and a major source of irritation all week. \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we chose our rooms, we realized that the 3rd bedroom wasn’t a bedroom at all, but simply a pull out couch in a sort of den. i’d have to say this wasn’t really accurate in the listing.\\r\\n\\r\\nanother week long irritation was the plumbing. it didn’t seem equipped to be able to handle the number of people advertised. the plunger saw a lot of use over the course of our stay....\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally the most major issues occurred as we were leaving. the hosts let us know they’d be stopping by to clean for other guests that morning, which was initially fine, but when they arrived not only did they make us feel rushed, but one of them actually walked in on one of our group getting dressed! (yes the door was closed...)\\r\\n\\r\\nto summarize: the property itself is lovely, but some of the amenities didn’t work as advertised and the host’s behavior left a lot to be desired.adam and alex´s house is a really nice,comfortable and spacious house , with all we needed ( very nice kitchen, laundry... ) and where  it was really pleasant to stay. because of the weather, we didńt have chance to profit of the nice backyard . we stayed  there for 4 days : it is a convenient place to visit sf : located in a quiet street but very close to public transportation  (it´s really easy to go dowtown with the bus) and to a whole food market. we recommand it to stay in san francisco.\\nadam and alex have a lovely home in a quiet side street. it is very stylish, spacious and comfortable with a fantastic courtyard garden. everything you could wish for was provided.they are extremely thoughtful, helpful and anxious to please.\\r\\nhaight ashbury is an amazing and colourful experience with great eating places, fascinating shops, with convenient food stores and transport links. the golden gate park is great - be sure to visit the japanese garden. we loved san francisco.beautiful house, perfect location and the best hosts. would absolutely stay again without hesitation.adam n alex are gracious hosts and very accommodating.  their house is huge.  if you happen to have a car, day parking is a block away.  kitchen is amazing to cook in. we (my wife, our two teenage children, and i) had a great stay at adam n alex\\'s house in the haight.  the location is perfect; one block away from the entrance to golden gate park (right where the off the grid food trucks come on thursday nights).  there\\'s a whole foods right around the corner, and plenty of other places within walking distance.   the house was very nice; the beds were comfortable, the kitchen is beautiful, and the backyard area is a really special place.   adam and alex were very responsive with their communication regarding the stay.  we had everything we needed, and we would definitely recommend staying here.my family and i loved staying at adam and alex\\'s place in the haight. its a beautiful, peaceful space, so well laid out, wonderful sit out in the back, spacious rooms with alot of light, great kitchen. its a block away from the gg park, which we loved. we wished we could have stayed for longer! their home is truly a home of warmth, that was evident to us. \\r\\nadam and alex were very easy to communicate with and made sure that our stay was comfortable. \\r\\nwe are super happy we chose this property. we would love to come back again sometime and hopefully stay for longer even (:\\r\\nthanks a bunch adam and alex, we truly appreciate you opening your warm home to us. adam and alex were excellent hosts, and made the whole process extremely easy for our group, both ahead of our visit and then once we had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe complicated things by arriving and leaving at different times, but the guys were fantastic in accommodating us and ensuring we had what we needed for our stay in sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house itself was exactly as described and really very, very nice. we loved having access to the garden and the fact that there was a whole foods around the corner was an added bonus.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all our experience was really top notch, and i would highly recommend adam and alex\\'s place to anyone travelling to sf, be it for business of pleasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks guys, i am sure we\\'ll be back next time!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwe stayed at adam and alex\\'s house and it was wonderful. they were generous with their things and made sure we were comfortable. the house is very well appointed with everything you need and is perfectly located in the haight street district. amazing hosts, amazing home.  our family group of seven people was in town for a funeral and adam & alex could not have been considerate and gracious in their accommodating us and in communicating prior to our arrival.  we were provided options as to how to set-up the rooms and they even provided some provisions in the refrigerator.\\r\\nthe home is gorgeous, spacious, and spotlessly clean.  the location is prime for easy access to the park, museums and haight-ashury & cole valley neighborhoods, with the major subway line a few blocks away to get you anywhere else in the city.adam and alex\\'s home was perfect for our group.  we felt completely at home and comfortable from the minute we got there and alex showed me around.the neighborhood is awesome -- close to the park, whole foods and the haight.  \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir pics are completely accurate.  the house is immaculate, there are plenty of towels, and everything you could need.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks guys!  we appreciate you hosting us!this was perhaps the most amazing airbnb experience i\\'ve ever had.  i have used airbnb several times in several countries and it\\'s usually a good experience, but this was outstanding in so many unexpected ways. first off adam and alex are incredibly gracious and wonderful hosts. we came in super late and they made the whole place feel like home.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is amazing. seriously, amazing (coming from someone who used to live in sf). it\\'s right next to the park, great restaurants around, lots of place to explore, near several great museums, easy uber access, lots of public transportation, a farmers market, a food truck hangout, a whole foods 1 block away... amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe kitchen is really a kitchen with a capital k. every spice, pan, knife, cooking implement you could hope for is there. we used that kitchen everyday and it was a godsend since we were visiting with our daughter. everything worked perfectly, was beautifully clean and shiny, and just made you want to cook more! i only wish we got to use the grill - but we were just so busy enjoying the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis unit has lots of unexpected surprises - there\\'s actually a garage which adam and alex were kind enough to let us use (we arranged to do so beforehand), there were tons of toys and books for our daughter to entertain herself with, there\\'s a beautiful piano we played a few evenings, and this seems to be a part of sf where the weather is always perfect. they have great wifi, a scanner, a printer, a fax machine - which actually ended up being useful for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe pretty much walked to the park everyday where there was a really mindblowing playground and an awesome carousel that our daughter (and we) enjoyed. there was a phenomenal food truck gathering on fridays with live music. there is the best ice cream shop in the world around the corner. a very reasonable gym that i got day passes for a short walk away.\\r\\n\\r\\nall-in-all this was an amazing trip. we stayed for several days and i didn\\'t want to leave. i felt very lucky that we found such a fantastic spot with such amazing hosts. i am trying to think of something that i wish had been different - but it was honestly just great through and through.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will be back. i really hope this feedback is helpful as you make your decision. this is a really phenomenal place, and adam and alex were lovely hosts. i hope you enjoy their home as much as we did.i can\\'t recommend alex, adam and their amazing house highly enough! alex and adam are amazing hosts; buying groceries for our arrival, having cleaners in mid-stay to get everything tidy and clean again, providing great recommendations for things to do / places to eat and last but not least, their well stocked kitchen makes the whole experience a culinary dream! this is a real home from home and you will not be disappointed! aside from all this, the location is exceptional - seconds from golden gate park, the delights of haight street and a few mins walk from the shops and restaurants of cole valley (where you can get some great food). for anyone with kids, this is the ideal place to stay too as the house has everything you need, from cribs, to strollers, stair gates and more toys and books than you could ever need! i highly recommend alex & adam\\'s place - perfect! alex and adam made us very welcome in their perfectly located and appointed san francisco home.  alex met us on arrival and gave us a very comprehensive guide to the house which was both well furnished and decorated whilst also being accessible and open to general use.  a complimentary supply of delicious and high quality snacks were left as well as essentials for were foods were provided as part of the package.  we were also given free use of all the kitchen supplies.  the house was in impeccable condition, close to local amenities and transport as well as feeling safe and secluded.  we also enjoyed having the use of the serene yard to chill and relax in.  we would highly recommend this property and the charming hosts. thank you alex and adam for making our family, including 2 teenage boys, feels so welcome and for the great wifi!it\\'s very good experience. all the thing is like the pictures. the big surprise is the kitchen. all my family enjoy cooking in the kitchen.\\nadam and alex, we\\'re leaving now and leave two keys and the garage key on the desk. wish we can back again.the place was very nice and met my groups needs perfectly. i was not able to meet for check in so i sent my coworker. he was running late and couldn\\'t find parking. he was then greeted by a very upset host who was not welcoming in the least bit. otherwise communication via email was prompt and the stay was fine. adam n alex did an amazing job! we had an awesome cheese plate and other amenities waiting for us upon our arrival. their house is absolutely gorgeous! i was almost sad i didn\\'t have more time to stay in their house instead of being out and about within san francisco. \\r\\n\\r\\nadam n alex made it very easy for us to stay with them. several times we had to adjust our travel plans and they were able to accommodate us each and every time. their house is within walking distance of numerous family owned shops and restaurants which is always a plus when you can support the local community. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend staying with adam n alex whenever you\\'re in the san francisco area. i know i will again.\\r\\n\\r\\n we enjoyed the house very much.  exceptionally nice design in the common areas and hosts were very nice to leave a basket of food goodies in the kitchen.  master bedroom was super and second bedroom just fine for a couple.  third bedroom would be a little small for a couple,  location was excellent – great access to shops and golden gate park.wow!  another fantastic trip to sf with adam and alex.   everything was *perfect* and adam and alex are so incredibly accommodating we felt like we were home.  it\\'s hard to travel with kids but this location in cole valley can\\'t be beat.  we went to the park, visited the shops, went to all the museums, and could still make it home in time for nap.  the kitchen was fully stocked, whole foods is right around the corner, and we were surrounded by more great restaurants than we could visit.  our favorite is \"the ice cream shop\" of course!\\n\\nall in all this was a great place and a great trip.  we\\'ll be back again!\\nwe had such a fantastic trip.  adam and alex are the best hosts.  the location of their place is perfect and they keep it beautiful.  we will definitely be back!!!the apartment is really as incredible as it looks in the photos!  the downstairs pull-out twin couch bed is really comfortable (not to mention pretty cool engineering).\\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately my late arrival didn\\'t give much time to chat with michael, but he was friendly leading up to and upon my arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe street outside his place is pretty unique.  i found street parking a block away, but i had to get up around 9am to pay for parking.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis is very busy part of town, with a good amount of traffic and a lot of construction within a couple blocks.  just plan in a little extra time to get out of the neighborhood if you are driving. michael\\'s place is exactly as pictured; extremely clean and comfortable. if you are not a light traveler and have heavy luggage, you might want to hail a cab and it\\'s slightly uphill from the main street.  otherwise, walking from the bart station is no problem at all.  michael was extremely friendly and helpful and i recommend him as a host!this listing was really good, superb location. the sofa bed was really comfortable. michael wasn\\'t in town when i arrived, but was super helpful in letting me in. professionally organised. would recommend to everyone.arrived in sf for 2 nights for business and was able to book my stay at michael\\'s which was located just around the corner from the office.  the modern loft was perfect and the couch foldout bed was very  comfortable!  bathroom is on the 1st level along with the living room and foldout couch so the layout worked really well.  neighborhood was in a good location and really quiet too.  and the price just can\\'t be beat!  thanks very much michael for sharing your home.host was friendly, gave advice on good spots for food and general interest. he wasn\\'t very talkative, which isn\\'t a negative, but if you prefer getting to know your hosts, he may not be the one for you. great as a central location for local events.great, didn\\'t have any problems with anything. michael is a very friendly and considerate host. he keeps the loft very tidy and often gave great food and event suggestions. definitely recommend staying!michael was a very nice host. we felt very welcome. he gave us great suggestions for what to do in san francisco.  even though did a share reservation and stayed in his living room, we always felt very comfortable. he was always very friendly and pleasant to chat with during the day and was very quiet at night. his place was clean.clean and comfortable place. excellent location!michael\\'s home is just like the photos open,airy, and very inviting. upon arrival he had water and tea available for me. he was kind enough to prepare my bed while i was out late seeing a concert. when we finally had a chance to meet in the morning he was very helpful in suggesting several great places to eat for breakfast of brunch! his neighborhood is wonderful! i would totally live there. it was safe, clean and in walking distance to public transit and restaurants. i also used uber which was actually very easy and affordable. i would totally stay there again!!! o and i love that you can reach his neighborhood by bart directly from the sfo airport!michael was a very considerate host.  his loft was tidy, and the fold out was surprisingly comfortable.  his place is very well located, and i would highly recommend this accommodation for anyone with a busy itinerary. i had a very good experience at michael\\'s. i strongly recommend this place. the space is at the living room of the loft. the couch expands into a bed for one person. it\\'s not very spacious, but it\\'s a good place to stay for one person exploring sf. it\\'s a very safe neighborhood. the loft is in a quiet place in downtown, it\\'s very close to shopping area (yah!) yet allows privacy. michael was very friendly, he offered advice to go around in sf.michael was a great host. i got a little turned around while walking from the bart to his flat, but he texted me directions that got me back on track. he was friendly and easygoing, and the flat was a beauty, kept immaculately. i\\'m not too familiar with the city, so michael helped me out with directions for walking to several places. he also offered to let me leave my backpack in the flat until i left for the airport, which was much appreciated. we had a great conversation the next morning before i headed out for the day. all in all, a great stay. i would recommend him to others, and would stay there again. michael happened to be my alumni! we talked a lot about school and pittsburgh. he is super nice.\\r\\nthe listing is accurate, and the loft is clean. i think it is superb if you travel alone and don\\'t mind sharing the space with the host.\\r\\nthe neighborhood is quite and is very near the beach. 15 mins walk and you can get to ferry building market place, where there is a farmers market there every saturday. michael was a very accomodating host. i kept an odd schedule and he allowed me to sleep in the middle of the day. the bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood quiet. he also provided plenty of recommendations for food and activities.michael was very pleasant and hospitable. the place was good and location-wise easy enough to walk around.  michael was a very welcoming host. i tend to be more private and michael gave me the space i needed. he was super friendly and his place is walking distance from a lot of what downtown san francisco has to offer. the fold out couch bed was also surprisingly comfortable!michael was the airbnb host i\\'ve had to date. very friendly guy, easy going. he even lent me a jacket to keep warm!\\n\\nregarding the accommodation:\\neasy instructions getting into place\\nfriendly welcoming gift of tea/coffee\\nsafe area. steps to views of the bay bridge, fishermans wharf\\nplace is very clean inside and out. nice loft apartment. \\nsheets, blankets, pillows are all on point. never too hot or cold.\\n\\n5 of 5 stars. would recommend to anyone looking for a warm, friendly accommodation.michael\\'s loft was a great location for me while i was in sf for a conference. only a couple blocks from moscone center and a pretty quiet spot, which is a nice respite from conference craziness. michael was very friendly and had great recommendations for restaurants. the sofa bed was super comfy.michael\\'s place is clean and well set out in a nice part of town. he was accommodating with my baggage as i was flying out at 10.30pm. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe couch was comfortable and the room was quiet. thanks for the great stay. great location in soma. ideal for my short work trip.i have always used airbnb but never something like this, wasn\\'t sure how it would be. but, michael is a great host and super friendly. the couch has a easy pull out mattress, which is actually very comfortable. the pillows and blankets are great too. michael even let my friend and i leave our luggage there after we checked out until later that night so we didn\\'t have to carry it around everywhere. this was a huge plus and made the trip work perfectly. would definitely stay here again, the loft is beautiful.the listing is accurate, the photos show that you are sharing a rather small studio space.  the location is very central  - a 15 min walk to the core of sf.  \\r\\nit would be better if the host would provide a small rack to hang up wet articles of clothing, a towel or a hanger or 2...\\r\\ni also found that i was not able to work at michael\\'s place as there was no privacy, but that should have been expected by me i guessmichael was an awesome host and very accommodating. perfect location and very safe. if it\\'s available when i\\'m back in sf, i\\'ll definitely book again. \\n\\nmichael\\'s chill. his place is super nice and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. the pull out couch is more of a bed really, and it\\'s quite comfy!michael was a gracious and welcoming host. he offered tea, suggestions for places to go in the nearby area, and provided all that i needed as far as linens and a towel. he was a very friendly guy, but also let me have solitary time as needed. the place itself is fairly small, which is unsurprising for a location in the middle of san francisco, but the pull out couch was comfortable. as it says in the description, the loft is quite sunny, so if you need it to be pitch black to sleep, expect to wake up early in the morning. overall, i would recommend the location to anyone who doesn\\'t need a lot of space and wants to be close to the action in san francisco.michael was a very friendly and hospitable host, and the place was in a great location. excellent place to stay with a convenient location in soma.michael was great. communicating with him was easy he was welcoming and the place is clean and identical to what is described.\\r\\nmichael was a great host -  my trip was for business and reading past reviews, i selected this location because it was within walking distance to the moscone center - also did not hurt to find out my host was from the pittsburgh area ;) \\r\\n\\r\\nsuper convenient and michael had some excellent tips for dining that i took advantage of - thanks again!\\r\\n\\r\\njerrymike was available at most hours and was quite cordial as a host. the pullout sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable. i would definitely recommend out of towners to stay with michael.i really enjoyed my stay here. great location and the host is a cool guy. will hopefully get the chance to stay here again!michael was a fantastic host. he was friendly, communicated well, and was helpful. he recommended several vegan dinning options that turned out to be great experiences. even though i was sleeping on his pull out couch bed, he provided me with plenty of personal space. the  shower was fantastic, the kitchen was well equipped, and the one way street was very quiet, during the day and at night. i would most  definitely stay here again.michael is a great guy and it was nice being able to chat with him.  the space was convenient for me and exactly as described.  thanks!great location and michael is a great host great place to stay in sf if you plan to visit for a few days. michael was very kind and accomodating, and he even let me check out later than he should have. the apartment was very clean and the location was very convenient, just a few blocks from local transportation. i would definitely stay there next time i\\'m in town.i was in san fransisco for a conference, that was located at the moscone center west. it a perfect 10-15 walk there. on the way there are coffee shops and an awesome chocolatier (depending on the road you take). michael is personable, hospitable and courteous. he even got me some ice cream from this amazing ice cream place! btw if he gives you food rev commendations you should take them, you won\\'t regret it. the apartment is super convenient, safe and clean, and all the buzz about the couch bed being comfy is true!!!michael was a great host. he is very considerate and provided great local recommendations.  great stay, highly recommend. very easy to get around town, bed was comfortable, and overall a good deal. mike is also a very friendly guy and easy to get along with which helped enhance the experience, provided tons of recommendations on what to do in san francisco.michael is accommodating and

kind, caring and very hospitable. this was our first airbnb experience, and i\\'m glad to say we loved it. gower and robyn welcomed us in to their amazing home and took time to show us around when we collected the keys. we knew the area quite well and chose this location because of that and it didn\\'t disappoint, especially the amazing views of north beach and the bay bridge are some of the best i\\'ve seen in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\ngower and robyn were very welcoming and the apt was great!  everything you need, fantastic location, and gorgeous roof top terrace. definitely recommend this apt to anyone visiting sfthe reservation was canceled 76 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.great place. great location. great view. great host. although tricky to findbreathtaking views, great central location, helpful hosts.  the apartment had everything we needed for our stay, and made us feel as if we actually lived in san francisco.  the host canceled this reservation 46 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.gower, robyn, and kayla were all extremely helpful, detailed, and prompt with responses. the neighborhood was in a close proximity to everything! you can walk or take ride shares or public transits. we opted with uber and most rides were between $4 - $18. and finally, the house was absolutely stunning with breath taking views! it took me a month to find a great place, within walking distance in a safe neighborhood, reasonably priced and spacious and comfy, and robyn and gower\\'s place exceeded all expectations. my group kept complimenting me on finding this place, but all the compliments go to robyn and gower for opening up their home.robun welcomed us warmly. the flat was as described nice and very well decorated.\\r\\nthe terrass is as on the photo and we have a large and wide view of the sf bay. \\r\\ntop address near to little italy and downtown sf. we really recommend this place.thank you so much for organizing everything so wellrobyn and gower were wonderful hosts, everything about their home was outstanding! rooftop terrace has tremendous views, we spent our evenings sipping cocktails and enjoying the view of the coit tower, north beach, golden gate bridge and the bay. location is near all the great spots in sf, taxis and über are always nearby. convenient grocery and spirits store across the street, many restaurants within walking distance. highly recommended, 5 stars!perfect location. stunning view and awesome owners. really cannot ask for more.i was warmly welcomed and was given all the information i needed. their place is beautifully decorated and arranged, and has the best roof deck in the city. wonderful hosts.great hosts and a great property! we ll be back!this is truly a spectacular apartment.  the views from the roof terrace and the interior of the house are breathtaking and unmistakably san francisco.  the house is well-appointed and decorated with quirky objects from around the world.  gower and robyn are gracious hosts who responded immediately to our emails and were very flexible and easygoing.  the house is well-stocked with high-quality espresso pods.  it is a short (though steep) walk to anywhere in central san francisco and there are plenty of restaurants and shops within a couple of blocks.  overall, i think this is an ideal place to stay to make the most san francisco. everything worked out well. great host, amazing apartment with great views over the city.we really enjoyed staying in gower and robyn\\'s townhouse.  robyn was very accommodating--our plane arrived early and she came to the townhouse early to let us in--spent plenty of time showing us the ins and outs of the house.  the view on the roof is really amazing and the location (though be prepared for hills) is perfect--20 minutes walk to union square, ferry building, a bit further to marina but still walkable. ubers are everywhere and made it easy to get around.thank you kindly to gower and robyn! they kept in contact with us before our trip, and made sure we had no trouble locating and accessing their home.\\r\\n\\r\\ntheir home is exactly as listed with a very nice kitchen, great view from the dining room, cozy bedrooms, very nice bathrooms, and a beautiful roof top. their home is one of the tallest structures in the area, so the view from the roof top deck was great for having coffee in the mornings, drinks in the evenings, and taking great photos of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe found several great restaurants in the area, include a recommendation from gower and robyn, gigi\\'s. the food was delicious, but be sure to make reservations ahead of time. the coit tower and many of the piers hosting tourist attractions are walkable. we appreciated how quiet and peaceful the home is while being close enough to some neighbor bars and restaurants to keep us entertained.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe definitely recommend and would stay in this home again!we stayed mid march for 3 nights, party of 4, pre visit communications excellent, as was the instructions. we were met by robyn who was clearly proud of her house, and rightly so, some feat of engineering to fit the tall house into the space.\\r\\nthe house was very well appointed and extremely comfortable, with amazing views from the rooftop, where we spent a lot of time, very good for night photography too.\\r\\na wonderful experience to wake up and have such amazing views from both the bedroom, living room and roof.\\r\\none word of warning, it is pointed out that access is up a steep hill, and many steps, it really is, and does test your cardio system if not used to it, do not let that deter you, it really is worth it!the host canceled this reservation 103 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.my stay was absolutely wonderful and can’t thank robyn and gower enough for allowing the opportunity to call it ‘home’.  san francisco is about many things, including exploring hidden walkways/stairs and homes.  this home is one of them as it’s accessed via a private walkway/alley, an experience onto it\\'s own!!  the owners have wonderfully updated/built this duplex home and while some parts of the home have some expected wear, it did absolutely nothing to diminish the wonderful experience and convenience of having an updated character view home.  of course, san francisco is also about views and either it’s the oversized double hung picture windows in the kitchen/dining/master bedroom areas or the spacious and cozy rooftop deck, the views are quintessentially san francisco, and that’s an understatement!  as for the neighborhood, telegraph hill is one of my favorites and this home’s location can’t be beat in terms of conveniently getting out on foot and exploring.  much like san francisco, the home is an experience from top to bottom, just make sure stairs are your thing :-)the host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.awesome place. walking distance to everything  (if you are not afraid of hills).  really nice views from rooms and roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nspent there 2 weeks on a work trip and would not replace this with any hotel.rebecca was an excellent host.  she was readily available to answer  all questions and gave us lots of advice on restaurants, shopping and all the great things to see and do in san francisco. (including some tips that only locals would know) her place was clean and situated in one of the best parts of the city.  i would highly recommend her as a host and would definitely stay at her place again.rebecca\\'s flat is spacious, full of light, tidy, in a great part of town, and she is a great great host--responsive, accessible, quick to help out with anything needed, and thought of all the little details. i would definitely stay with her again in sf. maria and her family made me feel like home during my stay. they warmly received me, treated me with fruits and breakfast, and let me taste the pacific crab. with their aid i biked around sf, experienced the hilly scenes of the city in the most efficient way.everything during my stay was as advertised. my hostess was very accomadating. the other guests were very good also. the price was as advertised.\\r\\nthank you for your time.\\r\\nsincerely,\\r\\nbob weardamaria is a gracious host and her family are welcoming and friendly. this was my first experience using airbnb and my first time in the bay area, and i am very thankful that i found this place. the couch was comfy, and having the kitchen and internet access was very convenient. i made the walk to the bart station every day and i always felt like i was in a safe location. i would definitely stay again!i like maria\\'s way to receive guests and make them feel like at home. in the house i knew genuine and interesting people i won\\'t never forget.maria is a very sweet, warm person. she was busy upkeeping this property and others, so i did not see her much. i would have liked to be received by maria in person, but she did communicate with me about the house key, linens, etc. and i settled in on my own. i was delighted that the home was not, in fact, shared with pet birds, as the photos showed. this was my first experience with airbnb and due to budget and proximity to my obligations, i chose the couch option. it was a fair experience for the cost. i would recommend one of the bedrooms in this home, if you can afford it/ if they are available. sleeping on a couch while a handful of other people are in and out every day makes for an interesting experience. but, if the price is right and you need a place to sleep-the couch option will do fine for anyone willing to consider it. just hope that you have good housemates like i did.... maria was wonderful!  she was accommodating and friendly.  if your on a budget and carefree then this is the place for you.the house is very conveniently located, it\\'s right next to an express line to downtown, or just a 2 minute walk to 3 other lines. the room was exactly as described, and the bed was very comfortable. wi-fi worked really well too. \\r\\n\\r\\nmaria was very nice and very flexible with our arrival time, which changed at the last minute due to a delay. i would definitely recommend this host. maria was a very gracious and friendly host. her home is comfortable and clean and i would recommend it to travelers any time. very close to public transportation to get around in the bay area. maria was a wonderful host! thank you for all!maria\\'s pink square house was perfect. she was a great host, friendly and helpful, doing things like changing the bed sheets herself while i\\'m standing right there watching and putting up with my vagueness about arrival time. glen park is a very vibrant neighborhood and within easy bus range of downtown. i booked five nights and regretted not booking more. maria is a great host! she gave me many tips and has spent considerable time talking with me, although my bad english ... the sofa is comfortable and though placed in the living room i hadn\\'t problems with other tenants, but i recommend you take a private room if available, but for the low price you pay you can stand the morning breakfast of tenants! absolutely choose maria\\'s house for your visit in san francisco, excellent location and unbeatable prices!comfiest sofa bed ever slept on! good amenities; affordable; close to very frequent buses. recommended.great place to stay!the price for this space was wonderful! it\\'s a great crashpad if you need one for short term stays. in general, most people keep to themselves, cook very seldomly, and are not found out in the living room area. i did put up and privacy curtain for my own personal reasons which worked out just great. the couch is very comfty and the heating pad helped a ton! the house in general is colder than it is outside which was a bit of a bother for me in sf winter. i get cold rather easy so i was always in sweats. it\\'s an old house but it being a quite house was a delight. maria was pretty on top of things but does run quite a few properties so she does keep busy. but any issues or suggestion i brought up was taken care of within a day or two. like in most of sf, you\\'ll find little nats (fruit flies) flying about. it wasn\\'t too bad and she\\'s working on resolving the issues soon. but it\\'s good to know if your staying in this space!  overall a good deal for short term stays!maria was a nice host. however, the place was poorly insulated, and it gets too cold at night. i had to wear my winter coat that i wear for chicago winters when i need to walk around in the morning, that\\'s how cold it was. maria tried to remedy the situation by installing some insulation on the doors and windows, it barely helped. my friend and i slept on the couch, it was comfortable, but cleanliness of the house leaves much to be desired. a lot of flies can be seen flying around, and there\\'s always this inexplicable stench.\\r\\nfree cereal was a nice touch though.as stated by the other guests, the apartment lacks insulation, which means it can get pretty cold at night. maria partly solved it with a portable heater and bed warmers, but prepare to be a bit freezing. apart from that, though the couch is, by definition, in a common room, the other guests were very careful not to disturb our sleep and let us have some privacy. maria was a good host, very nice and communicative.this is a great place to stay and maria is a great host! it\\'s perfect if you\\'re on a budget. i know some other reviews mention that there isn\\'t much heat, but it was completely fine during my stay. maria offered blankets and heaters if needed, but it turns out everything was fine and i had ample heat. i highly recommend any room in her property!maria was very helpful with everything. she was considerate about move in and out times. even though i was booking last minute and was working long hours, she was able to accomodate for me. also, she was very understanding about any situations that arose. hands down recommend any of her rooms for people coming to san francisco. almost forgot to mention the affordable prices that her rooms are listed at. bottom line, maria is awesome.i stayed at this place for 3 weeks during an internship. i appreciated location being close to public transport, a cheap supermarket with fresh food and mission street, contact to other housemates and maria, and the convenient bed and big kitchen. maria also helped me out when i became sick ;) it is definitely a nice and comfortable place to stay for a couple of weeks (even though it is a bed in the living room), and extremely cheap for a central place in sf. i have stayed for 7 days in this house. the location is convenient in all sorts of ways: 5mins walking to mission street for bus, 10mins walking to bart metro station, big oriental shopping mall nearby, several restaurants in that area. and the host maria is just a such helpful and nice person. we had lots of interesting discussions. only thing can be considered as uncomfortable was, it gets cold in the living room during the night and early morning. to sum up, highly recommended for any short or mid term stay!comfortable spot, very nice housemates. great place to stay, very convenient location, maria makes everything easy for the hosts. i definitely recommend it!the stay at maria\\'s was wonderful.  i am not sure what others mean by it gets cold, it was plenty warm for me and the down comforter she provided.  i would definitely stay there again if i needed to.maria was a wonderful host. she was always there to answer any questions you had about the city. she was always concerned about your welfare . also her monthly potluck to which all of her quests were invited was a wonderful happening. when i come back in november i am making a point to attend.maria is a host with a gentle touch. she was great and the price and location were excellent! thank you!!!a extremely pleasant stay. maria was a great host who gave us all christmas presents and held dinners for thanksgiving and christmas believe it or not. she does a great job creating community while giving her guests space.\\r\\n\\r\\nshe made sure the home is plenty warm and guests had everything they needed. the shower had lots of nice hot water in this room. the home was quiet. i wasn\\'t disturbed at all by the other guests. there was plenty of parking and is within walking distance of bart. i had a great experience and have stayed here again.not a bad spot for a week or so, the place is quiet and the other (sensitive contents hidden) i had were really great. you\\'ll want to be a social outgoing person though, as your bed is essentially in the kitchen and right next to the front door. its never a problem at night though. also be warned its a futon so its horribly uncomfortable. other the that you should also know i never experienced an problems but the neighborhood watch came by and informed me of several muggings very close to the house so word to the wise be aware!maria is a great host! i was supposed to stay there for 2 weeks but i only stayed 1 night and got my money back pretty quickly (no problem at all with maria in that sense), so i would only recommend this place if you to stay in one of the private rooms for the following reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) the bed in the common area is too cold, really bad house isolation, bed is next to 2 huge windows and to the main door, meaning that when anyone goes out or inside the house the cold wind comes by your bed. \\r\\n2) when i stayed there was a really lousy guy staying at the house who went inside and out of the house plenty of times during the night and so it was really stressful because he didn\\'t care at all that there was someone sleeping there. \\r\\n\\r\\njust ask for the private room, in my experience it\\'s not worth the money you save vs the bed in the kitchen that shouldn\\'t be offered as an option in first place (unless the house had good isolation and no lousy roommates). \\r\\n\\r\\nexactly what it says. it\\'s clean place located near many mass transit choices and the freeway. well i suppose it was as good as living in a living room could possibly be. the hosts were very nice and unobtrusive. the other tenants, though many, kept to themselves so the lack of privacy you get with this arrangement is not exacerbated by the constant presence of others. the general infrastructure of the house was in very poor condition but it was kept as clean as it could be. if for nothing less, this arrangement \"encourages\" you to get out of the house and explore nicer parts of san fran. i wouldn\\'t recommend staying here for more than a few weeks. but that\\'s just me. i really enjoyed staying in the living room. maria and her brother are great hosts. during my stay, they left a bowl full of lemons and oranges in the kitchen with a \"free to anyone\" sign.i liked the place so much that i booked it for another couple weeks. unfortunately, when i found out that my project in sf was extended, someone else had already booked it, so i had to go elsewhere. it was chilly, but i survived the freeze in early december. oh, and funny thing. there was a lady living downstairs who always came home about half an hour after i went to bed. so if it was a weekday and i went to bed at 11:00, she would come home half an hour. same story on a weekend when i went to bed at 2 am. didn\\'t bug me because it takes me an hour to fall asleep, but i was amused.the space offered wasn\\'t ideal, but extra steps were taken to make it much more comfortable than expected. maria is very accessible via multiple platforms, and she has family living in the residence if there is ever an emergency! start to finish a simple experience.stayed at maria\\'s place for couple of weeks in march 2014. small but enough for someone who wants to spend a few peaceful nights.extremely cost effective, maria & his brother bob are great hosts!i didn\\'t see maria during my journey in san francisco but her family is really great and welcoming. i arrive really late in the evening but they were here to welcome me.\\r\\ndon\\'t expect a fully comfortable room but it\\'s far enough for the price of the bedroom.the house and the private areas are absolutely identical to their description. this\\'s the neat and clean place, it\\'s not a palace or 7-star hotel, but if you plan to stay in the shared apartment, this place is the best conjunction of the good price and comfortable place. definitely. \\r\\nif you need to use public transportation to get somewhere, it\\'s also the bonus of the house - pretty much of the bus stops and \\'bart\\' station are located nearby. \\r\\nit was a pleasure to stay here. i enjoyed. loved the place and the neighborhood is pretty easy to get around.my stay at maria\\'s was great! being in the living room and kitchen and by the front entrance comes with foot traffic, front door lock, and kitchen noises, but it was minimal and not a problem for me. everything was safe, clean and comfortable. the closet provided was handy. great location too, it was easy to get to places by transit since i didn\\'t have a car. thanks for a wonderful stay!this was such a great place to stay. i arrived and was greeted by calm, cool and collected house mates that made me feel welcome. it\\'s perfect if you just need a place to rest up close to bart. definitely worth every bit of the money for a comfy bed as long as you bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. i\\'m a pretty heavy sleeper so the space was no problem for me. \\r\\na great and super affordable place. picture is as described. very peaceful. i would definitely stay here again. my stay was here was enjoyable. i was provided everything as described & maria always responded timely if i had any questions or concerns. the neighborhood was quiet, but has multiple shops/restaurants/markets within 5 mins walking.\\r\\nit\\'s a nice place to stay in while in sf, pretty close to the bart station and the bus stops. maria\\'s brother bob is a great host and helps with any problem. i definitely recommend this place. i had a very positive 1-month experience at maria\\'s house - she had freshly cleaned linens and towels ready for my arrival and was very accommodating. although i never had a chance to meet her, she was in touch via email as necessary. be sure that you\\'re okay with your space only being behind a privacy wall (it\\'s more private than it sounds!) the general area around the house felt very safe and convenient - i took an express bus into the city every day and the whole trip took less than 30 minutes, including walking. i have very mixed reviews for the nearby restaurants and grocery stores, but in general you have access to everything you need - with one exception: laundry. if you\\'re working late every day, the last thing you want to do is haul laundry ~15 minutes and then wait around for a few hours for it to be cleaned. i ended up biting the bullet and using one of the laundry pick-up apps, which was costly but the only solution that fit my schedule. overall, i can strongly recommend this space and area for a 1-2 week stay! it would be a great, quiet base for exploring the city.absolutely my favorite experience through airbnb. from the beginning, tish was available and accomodating. whats more impressive was the fact that she was out of town on business, and still managed to get back to us right away.\\r\\nmy husband and i are still weary about people and places we rent from, although weve rented from numerous owners. once we opened the door, all of our concerns were gone! tish\\'s place was modern, yet very comfortable. everything was clean to my standards. by my standards, i mean that im a borderline obsessive compulsive, but even with this said, i felt safe staying in this pure and refreshing home. the house itself is in a nice and quiet neighborhood with lots of parking! i know what your thinking...\"lots of parking in sf?!\" i promise you, we were able to park right in front of the house.\\r\\nwhen tish came back from her bussiness trip, i realized that this classy house was a huge reflection of its owner. tish was extremely accomodating to us, down to earth, and great person... we felt as though we were staying with family.\\r\\nstaying at tish\\'s place was one of the best experiences we\\'ve had from airbnb, and we are already talking about when to go back! you definately couldnt go wrong here!\\r\\nthank you so much tish!so... tish is pretty much one of the coolest people you will ever meet. she is always there to check up on you and if you ever need anything she always goes above and beyond to help you out.\\r\\n   if you love animals, the dogs here are the friendliest dogs ever and you just can\\'t say no to them. it is a very convenient place to be because its super close to the main road where all the food places and convenience stores are located.\\r\\n   a shout-out to her roommate jada, she is absolutely one of the nicest people you will ever meet and can help you out with all your public transportation questions if you are trying to figure out how to get around.\\r\\n  i would definitely stay here again because everything is neat, beautiful, and there is never really a dull moment in this house.\\r\\n  hope to see you and stay with you again in the future tish. loved the experience will never forget it!   \\r\\n    \\r\\nthe reservation was canceled 42 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.you will love this neighbourhood, our new favorite in san francisco. it\\'s super walkable, it\\'s super drivable (and parkable- wheee!), friendly, and nice. you will find some pretty awesome food at very reasonable prices (for san francisco).\\r\\ntank and cotton, tish\\'s adorable dogs, will turn you into a paw lover in no time. they are adorable and very well behaved and smart.\\r\\ntish truly gives you the best she that has, all she that has, to make the best of your stay.tish and jada were extremely accommodating and made our trip to san francisco run without a hitch. tish\\'s house is perfectly located for both car travel and public transportation into downtown. we had all the necessities and we were able to grab everything else we wanted at walgreens, cvs, or whole foods (all within walking distance). my husband and i felt very comfortable using the shared kitchen and dining room in the house and coming and going as we pleased. tish, jada, cotton, and tank were fantastic hosts for our first airbnb experience. we can\\'t wait to visit again!the reservation was canceled 20 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.tish and jada were the most friendly people ever! they made me feel so at home! i had the most amazing trip in sf because of them! both very connected and know everything there is to know about the city! always around and up for a good chat after a long day and love to joke around! staying with tish and jada there will never be a dull moment always so much fun around them! cotten and tank are so much fun and great you every time you walk back in the door! having stayed at a few air bnb places i think by far the best time i have had! thanks so much for having us tish and had a can\\'t wait to come back again! tish greeted us into her home… a beautiful 1920’s craftsman style house near the center of san francisco.  it was exactly as described, convenient to everything,  parking was a breeze and met all of our expectations.  even the 2 little dogs were a pleasure. tish did everything to make us feel at home and we did.  \\r\\nthanks\\r\\nmelissa and chucktish, jada, (tank & cotton, included!) and their home are the embodiment of the airbnb experience.  warm and genuine hospitality with safe, clean and comfortable lodging.   yes, it\\'s true--there is easy (free!) parking.  and, the k line muni transit is simple and convenient access to downtown (and, anywhere, for that matter--i.e. to bart to sfo).  the bedroom is uncluttered (so you have space for your stuff), the kitchen is modern and clean, the decor is comfortable, and you will immediately feel at home when you step over the threshold.  we come to the bay area often and were delighted to discover a new neighborhood and this pleasant residence, that,  we wouldn\\'t hesitate to call \"home\" again during a future visit!   tish is a very nice host and the house is exactly as nice as it is in the photos. she give us a warm welcome and her two cute dog are very friendly to us. it\\'s a perfect experience staying in her house.(url hidden)\\n\\r\\nyou haven\\'t truly experienced san francisco until you\\'ve stayed here with the unique tish & jada.\\r\\n\\r\\ntheir house is warm and cozy, clean and comfortable, and very conveniently located. tank & cotton are the friendliest dogs, and help make staying at their house like home. parking was always readily available right in front, and the close proximity to highway 280 made it easy to get both to the city and the valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is one thing, then there\\'s tish & jada... quite likely the 2 nicest people in all of sf. they constantly went out of their way to help out, give me space when i was working, and greeting me with a drink after long charged days full of meetings.\\r\\n\\r\\njust the perfect airbnb experience. great house, awesome people, the only downside, is now everyone else knows about this hidden gem.what a warm welcome we got from tish and het cute dogs when arriving at this place! we felt at home instantly.  they even had a nice bottle of wine waiting for us! the victorian house is comfortable and beautifully decorated. we enjoyed the great talks with tish and jada, and the cuddles with cotton and tank. and slept so well in that great bed! getting there is easy, from the freeway, from downtown but also by public transport to and from the airport. highly recommended!the place was great!  we were greeted by friendly hosts and pets.  the room was clean and was very comfortable.  the location was perfect and had plenty of parkingwe had a great stay at the beautiful home of tish and jada.  loved the neighborhood and they were both so warm and welcoming.  great house, comfortable room and comfy bed.  everything was immaculate and clean and exactly what they advertised.  we would go back in a heartbeat and had trouble leaving the two cute doggies behind!  we had a really nice time in the home of tish and jada! tish wasn´t at home during our staying, but we had a nice conversation with jada, drinking a glass of wine. the place is a fancy historical house in a quiet, safe neighborhood, about 40 min by the public transportation from the city center. it is nicely decorated and very comfortable. despite proclamation you won´t have the full place for you. there is a shared kitchen with two nice and kind women and 2 small, lovely and very friendly dogs. so not a big deal. we spent there 4 nights. it may be a bit chilly in night for somebody, but this is san francisco, so bring your warm pajamas. when we came the place was a bit messy (some dust under the bed, full trash bin, dirty dish in the sink … ), however there were some fresh flowers, a bottle of red wine and a nice cosmetic basket waiting for us, so overall good experience. we can recommend it!staying at tish\\'s home was great! she was a very nice host. even though we arrived too early, she was nice and friendly and even invited us for dinner. she was very helpful during our stay! the house is located in a safe neighborhood. i highly recommend tish\\'s home, not only because of the beautiful house but also because of her being such a great host.we had a nice time staying here. tish was out of town, but jada was very welcoming and communicated very thoroughly through text before and after we arrived. we were able to do laundry after spending 5 nights in yosemite which was so great. the room was nice, bed was comfortable, and shower was clean. jada helped us with suggestions of places to go in the city and shared a glass of wine with us. she was also very accommodating—when we were woken up by the dogs one night jada made sure to do her best to correct it the next. they woke us up again on our last night, so even though they were super cute and friendly dogs, that was the only downside. tish, jada & their two lovely puppies are the most amazing hosts tom & i ever had in the most gorgeous and stylist house ever! they were very helpful before we even arrived with fast and accurate answers regarding the location and the amenities of the house. they made us feel really welcome and help us accommodate in the san fransisco lifestyle with tips and advices on where to go & what to see! their house was amazing with one lovely master bedroom for us with our own double bathroom which was great. the washing and dryer machine was just perfect too and the cherry on the cake the perfect dish washing machine! anyway, all in all, i highly reccomend them and they are not just our host now, they are our friends which we will regularly meet as we are now properly settle in sf :) bloody brilliant!!!!as this was our first experience with airbnb we didn\\'t know what to expect but tish and jada were great hosts. they were nice and caring and were very helpful with suggestions on places. couldn\\'t have asked more. a lovely stay and two very welcoming hostesses (four if you count the dogs!). great location for anyone needing to commute via the freeways, and parking was a breeze! will book again!tish was very nice and accommodating.  the house was beautifully decorated and the room itself was spacious with a very comfortable bed and it\\'s own bathroom.we loved tish\\'s home! it was cozy, in a great neighborhood and perfect for what we needed this weekend! they were incredibly hospitable and their dogs were well behaved and so adorable!beautiful neighborhood, plenty of street parking, lovely home.  tish and jada are great hostesses and their little doggies cotton and tank are sweet and adorable.  there was a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us.  we loved our stay in their home.thank you for your hospitality, tish!the reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the room is in a very nice historic apartment and has its own bathroom. the location is great with easy access to everything. even though there is no dedicated parking, there is plenty of street parking available. shopping is close by and so are restaurants. so thrilled, to find the quaint bungalow nestled in the city. this sweet retro home is just adorable. all the comforts of home are available throughout our stay. a short walk down the road and you join the local scene of coffee shops and shopping.  the dogs were super cute, and welcoming. i loved the style and class that tish offers in her home. if i go again to that area, i will definitely stay again. \\r\\n\\r\\ndonna & john thank you for letting me stay at your beautiful home. having had read all the reviews before i booked, i can now say my experience was very similar to others. being able to stay here was the perfect first airbnb experience for me! it was pretty last minute on my end and all went very well. the home looks even more amazing and warm in person. speaking of warm, with the position of home, the morning sunshine streams in front living area and it is just beautiful. i appreciated the delightful welcome and house tour by lovely jada as tish was out of town for a couple days. when i met tish, who was also delightful, i enjoyed learning about the neighborhood / house history and the ideas for restaurants etc. it was a most pleasurable and memorable experience for sure ... i am already thinking of calendar dates and reasons to go back!\\r\\n\\r\\na million doula thank you\\'s! :) tish and her roommate were awesome hostesses. we felt comfortable and right at home. hands down the best environment for finding a temporary home away from home!tish was out of town during my stay, but she was very communicative and helpful prior to my arrival and sorting it out with her roommate jada on checking me in and showing me around, etc. i had a wonderful experience staying at their lovely house. jada was very warm and made me feel at home. the room is nice and clean and so is the bathroom across the hall. their dogs are friendly and adorable. there was plenty of street parking and it was a great neighborhood. me and my wife had a fantastic time on our trip to san francisco. trish made us feel welcome and was very helpful with good ideas on what to see in the city. the home is in a good location and we could get around easily. we would defiantly stay there again!this was my second stay at tish & jada\\'s house. always an awesome experience. comfortable, clean home, conveniently located, ample parking up front. these guys will go way out of their way to make your stay unforgettable. strongly recommended. they\\'re the reason i don\\'t stay at hotels anymore...our experience couldn\\'t have been more pleasant. especially being first time airbnb clients, here in the states\\ntish\\'s home is as spectacular as the pictures posted. we had access to everything in the house\\n tish & jada couldn\\'t have been more accommodating & gracious\\nthe information they provided on where to eat, places to go, local shops  (especially java on ocean, fabulous sandwiches & hummus ) are spot on\\nwe will definitely be back, they have become great friends & can\\'t wait to visit again, sooni fell in love with tish\\'s house, her neighborhood, and her lovely (and very well-behaved) little dogs. the room is large and comfortable, and the area is peaceful and safe. wish i were heading back soon!neighbourhood is safe and friendly but there is only 1 restaurant in walking distance and the nearest part of ocean (closest main street) is getting rundown. good k line link to downtown.\\r\\nlisting is ok - main public room is as shown. bedroom lacks hanging space, no lamps, very thin curtains on main windows. house suffers from very strong smell of dogs.\\r\\nwelcome was below average - no information (maps etc) in folders and we were directed on first night to restaurants that (according to locals) hadn\\'t been open in a while, see comments on room, had to request hangers to use on the back of the door and a bath plug. owner made loud phone calls between 6-8am on a number of mornings, one while walking up and down outside our room. dogs (although noted in description) bark continually, including at night.what a wonderful host and more importantly home. we very much enjoyed our stay at tish\\'s victorian home. it\\'s clean, has all the essential amenities, and is located in a very safe and easy to access part of town. if you have a rental car this is the perfect spot, parking is easy and plentiful. we ended up doing several uber car pools from her location to downtown for 10-15 bucks on average. there are plenty of locals who utilize uber in her area both to and from downtown, so travel is cheap and quick. tank and cotton were a treat to come home to each night. we\\'ll certainly have tish in our top 3 for sf. thank you again!welcoming, friendly, helpful hostess! comfortable accommodations with easy street side parking. beautiful neighborhood and home! very convenient to sfsu! we would stay here again! trish and her roommate jada were friendly and welcoming!! as soon as i arrived, i was even offered a yoga/trx class down the street :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, and i enjoyed walking around the absolutely beautiful neighborhood of st francis wood. i live in sf, so it was so fun to discover a new side of my city!we felt very welcome in tish\\'s house. a bottle of wine was waiting for us at our arrival. \\r\\nthe house is located at about 5 min from the tram stop which takes you in 30 minutes to down town sf. \\r\\nthe neighborhoud is very calm (residential), we had 3 very good sleeps. \\r\\nwe just slept at tish\\'s house, the rest of our day and evening we spent in the city. \\r\\nour car was parked in the street. very handy as no need to pay for parking. \\r\\nthe communication with tish and her room mate went very well. nice quiet area, some cool local cafes and restaurants plenty of yoga spots close by and a nice walk to the beach and zoo. if you want a really relaxed area of san fran, this place definitely a good spot to be.had such a great time in san francisco with tish and jada. really made me feel part of their home and even stayed up late to greet me. they allowed me into the home and even on occasion to hang out at local places with them and friends. tish\\'s puppy\\'s are super cute and easy to live with - but i am a dog person. transport is required to most touristy locations but i enjoyed being out of the city. thanks tish and jada.a lovely stay in sf, the house is beautiful, it is just 20 min away from downtown by public transportation, free street parking. highly recommended. thank you guystish was a wonderful, thoughtful hostess. her home was clean, and the room was comfortable. location was very convenient. enjoyed our stay. meredith and maurissa were amazing!!!!! their apartment is adorable and located in a perfect location! the price was very reasonable and their hospitality was top notch. would recommend this apartment to anyone!meredith\\'s apartment was great! we really enjoyed our stay there. the apartment was clean and the location was perfect. thanks again. we would definitely stay there again.kelly and darius were so accommodating.  we brought take-out garlic crab--not realizing how much garlic there was in it--and they gave us full use of their kitchen to warm it up.  the bedroom and bathroom were very clean, and quiet.  the living room had incredible views of the ocean.very nice stay. kelly was very easy going about my check in/out times, as i flew in overnight, and had an international flight to catch the next day. the room was nice, and the place had a million dollar view. i tried both of the closet restaurants, and the food, service and view were all top notch. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would stay there again. kelly and darius were really flexible and accommodating. we arrived a little earlier than expected, and they returned home soon after to allow us to check in. one night we watched a movie with them in the living room, and other nights we were out, so how much interaction you want is up to you (as the guest). they shared their dog dawson\\'s toys with our puppy, which we were grateful for (someone else\\'s toys is always more interesting!). and the real gem was that every morning we took an hour plus walk on the beach - it was literally across the street. overall, i would stay here again in a heartbeat. side note: we did rent a car so getting around the city was easy, however the bus stops were just across the street so i imagine getting around the city on public transport is easy enough.perfect location, so convenient and safe. the owner of apt kelly is so nice and very helfull, incredibly warm and kind person , so easygoing ,it\\'s been perfect days at her apt. very recommending stay at her place! by the way she has adorable dog :)))))kelly and darius (and dawson) are awesome hosts. highly recommended, great location, super clean, lots of space, friendly people. a+!kelly\\'s apartment is in a great oceanside spot, there\\'s a good range if shops and restaurants nearby and it\\'s very close to the golden gate park so it\\'s a great out of town location but very easy access to the city. \\n\\nthe room is very comfortable and spotlessly clean, really good bathroom too. the towels were lovely and soft and the bed comfortable. there was plenty of space fir our 2 cases and rucksack without us tripping over everything. \\n\\nit was also very quiet and restful.this is a great place to stay! my girlfriend and i had a great time in the city and loved staying here because of the great location and the cleanliness. the room and bathroom were very clean and private. \\r\\n\\r\\nbeing along the coast and right next to golden gate park make kelly\\'s place ideal if you want to  get away to the less crowded parts of sf. i have recommended her place to friends offline as great host, sweetest animals,  clean room, beautiful view.kelly did an amazing job making my husband and i feel welcome. she has the most beautiful view of the ocean! she does have very friendly (incredibly well mannered) dog. most certainly recommended this beach front private room to anyone looking for nature and city filled stay. darius and kelly were extremely warm and welcoming. they had fresh towels and linens available, and offered to let us use the kitchen and common areas. the location was amazing, great view and accessibility of the beach, and within walking distance of golden gate park. kelly waited for us till late that night due to our delayed flight, you will also get a large bathroom belonging to guest, through the ceiling of which you can see the sky. the living room is lovely with sea view as described in the picture, through we have to leave early for the road trip. \\njust a few blocks to the beach, nice location. street parking is easy to find. suitable for couples or single. better to bring your own airbed if you have parents staying with you. actually, the other day i met kelly\\'s two cute dogs first( i still don\\'t know their name tho lol). i have to say, kelly might be the luckiest girl ever to have such a fabulous beach house with beautiful view and only 5-10mins walk to the golden gate park. the room is clean with books and fragrant candle everywhere which i was intrigued by.  thank you kelly. all the best! kelly\\'s place was beautiful and very close to the beach. the room was very spacious and the bed was super comfy. i had a lot of questions and she answered every single one; plus she has two dogs who are adorable and friendly! kelly kept out of hair and let us do our thing during our stay. check in and check out was very flexible - i just wished we could\\'ve stayed for longer.great place to stay while visiting the bay area!  the morning jogs and views of the sunsets were amazing.  the room was nice and neat - - and kelly and darius were very good hosts!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe 2 dogs are super friendly -  and the condo is very quiet!  \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again for being so nice...i\\'ll keep in touch!\\r\\n\\r\\n-bradincredibly friendly and witty and smart host!trina is an amazing host! trina was a great host and was always eager to help.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is fantastic, just off dolores park.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would happily recommend to others.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks trina!the pictures don\\'t do this place justice, it\\'s absolutely beautiful and the expansive views show off the beautiful city night and day. the house was neat and clean and laura was great at making us feel welcome. it\\'s great for a family of 4+. we were a party of 5 including my brothers fiance and there was plenty of room to feel comfortable, have privacy and lounge around together - we felt like this was our home! the house is within walking distance to cafes and shops, has all the amenities (except for a tv which was actually a blessing) and gets amazing light. laura has a great sense of design and a fantastic book collection to boot!  very nice house with a great, modern design.  the deck is incredible, even better in person.  the view is amazing, pictures don\\'t really show you how striking it is. the place is perfect for a group.  the neighborhood is nice.  a very steep climb.  close to the castro, dolores park and the mission.  the larger beds were comfortable.  the singles were ok but we only used them because we were a large group of single guys.  hosts were responsive.  nightly rate is high but worth it.  overall, i highly recommend this house to others.amazing place with a breathtaking view of downtown san francisco!!! needless to say, my friends and i loved staying at laura\\'s apartment. she was very accommodating and helpful, and at our disposal for any clarification.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great place to stay while in san francisco.  we had an amazing 6-day stay at laura\\'s place. description and pictures make justice to what you find: a large, modern and very luminous house in a nice residential area. restaurants and shops around castro theatre are a short walk away and you can also reach noe valley by foot. if you want to go out by day to tour san francisco, but you want to get back in the evening and cook at home, sharing with your travel group in the amazing kitchen/dining/living room area, with an unbeatable view of the city, then this is the right place for you.\\nthe master room and a secondary room in the bottom floor share the bathroom, but are also connected to each other, which is perfect for families traveling with children (though there may be a little  lack of privacy if it\\'s only adults). the upper floor has two more rooms that share another bathroom. \\nlaura was extremely kind contacting us before the stay, and leaving us a \"welcome package\" with instructions and some other things to make the stay more comfortable. \\nwould definitely return! we had a fantastic stay at laura\\'s home. the house was exactly as described, perfect for two families with loads of space, very comfortable and the most incredible view. laura has small children so if you do too there are toys and books which ours really enjoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is great - castro in one direction, noe valley the other, and a quick muni or slower trolley downtown, so something for everyone. laura also left a helpful list of things to do which only a local would know about which made staying there more special. heed what she says about walking though - if you can\\'t manage (very) steep hills this is not the flat for you!\\r\\n\\r\\none tiny niggle was that there was no coffee maker, which meant a quick trip down the hill to bring back the morning caffeine. it wasn\\'t a huge deal, plus meant one person got an extra workout. i wouldn\\'t hesitate to recommend this place to someone with a family.had a group of colleagues stay here during a business trip. we all really enjoyed the house - the view of the city is incredible. laura \\'s a fantastic host and went out her way to make sure we had a great experience. i highly recommend staying here next time you visit san francisco.me and a few colleagues stayed at laura\\'s place for a week. the checkin and checkout were seamless. laura was very flexible with our requests and super prompt with all our questions. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is gorgeous - even better than the pictures. our favorite part was the roofdeck with lovely evening views of the city :)\\r\\nthe living area is airy and spacious and the rooms have a lot of character. all the little touches made us feel at home and we\\'d highly recommend laura\\'s place :)most beautiful place ever since i use airbnb.\\r\\nthe view is breathtaking, the house is also really cosy, clean and tidy. \\r\\nif i could give more than 5 star, i will definitely do it.\\r\\nthe place was great and spacious. a lot of things to do within walking distance, such as climbing up to twin peaks or further downhill in noe valley, the mission or castro.  would recommend taking uber if going back and forth to the city.  saves a lot of time over public transport.i helped my family book a stay with lyanne and they were absolutely thrilled with the place. despite lyanne and family being on their own trip at the time, they were kindly responsive and their friend who managed the property while my family was there was very helpful and welcoming. they described it as their home away from home, delighted in the availability of many children\\'s toys including legos, and wish to come back soon!tom and beth welcomed us upon our arrival, showed us their beautiful home, and told us about the neighborhood- where to go, what to eat. they were so accommodating and understanding that we would be using their home for an documentary interview. i hope we were as lovely guests as they were hosts. we had a truly wonderful stay at beth and jon\\'s place!  the house is a pleasure to be in, beautifully done, everything you could need, including for cooks!  beth was lovely and very easy and prompt to communicate with.  we also found great stuff in the neighborhood, good restaurants, bakeries, market.  would love to return.beth and tom were ideal hosts.  \\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, they were proactive and communicative by responding to all our initial inquiries timely and substantively.  \\r\\n\\r\\nsecond, before arriving they gave us a comprehensive list of information relating to our stay including access information, arrival details, neighborhood and city hints , etc. all in an easily-accessible electronic document.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthird, they allowed us access to the unit earlier than normal - we arrived around noon and everything was ready.  \\r\\n\\r\\nfourth, when we arrived a bottle of champagne was waiting for us along with other treats - made us feel at home.  \\r\\n\\r\\nfifth, tom came over and introduced himself to ensure we didn\\'t have any questions or concerns.  seeing that we were quite busy, tom and beth were kind enough to give us the privacy and space to allow us to conduct our business effectively (e.g., board meetings and conference calls).  nonetheless, beth checked in by phone to be sure there were no issues.  \\r\\n\\r\\nlastly, the accommodations were as advertised:  the unit was very clean, well-located, tastefully decorated and had all of the amenities you would either expect or want including, for example, a white noise machine in the front bedroom which faces the street on which the unit is located (there\\'s some minor street noise, but the machine effectively eliminates it so you can sleep well).  also, the beds were quite comfortable with very clean and fresh linens and pillows (a key for all veterans of airbnb stays).\\r\\n\\r\\nthere\\'s really not much we would change and i could see us returning there for future visits.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again to beth and tom for their attention to detail and warm hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\n  the home is in a perfect location… and the home is absolutely beautiful. \\r\\nthe description was exact... \\r\\nbeth and tom were very warm and welcoming we were extremely pleased with everything! \\r\\nif they would have us, we would stay there every time!from the moment we checked in and were greeted by a basket of goodies for my three sons and a bottle of champagne for my wife and i, i knew we rolled the dice with airbnb for the first time and were going to come out winners!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house couldn\\'t have been a better fit for a family of five.  living room, family room, large kitchen and eat-in area on the first floor allowed us to host family for a group dinner one night. plenty of space for the cousins to play and the adults to wine and dine.\\r\\n\\r\\nupstairs there are three large bedrooms with queen size beds in each room.  all finely furnished and detailed in every way.  washer and dryer tucked neatly behind folding doors allowed us to not sweat our three year old enjoying chocolate ice cream in the golden gate park on a sunny 75 degree afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are likely to be frequent visitors to san fran and will look to stay at beth and tom\\'s house each and every time.  a truly wonderful place!my 2 girlfriends and i stayed in this beautiful condo for 3 nights while we were traveling in ca. the place is modern and elegant. the location is great, close to the at&t park (even though we are not baseball fans. but if you are, you couldn\\'t ask for a better location!!!) and bay bridge (we loved the walk and the oysters served in waterbar and hogs island oyster company. yes, we went to both!!) our host heather is very friendly. we only met her when we checked in and right away she poured us some wine~~~ how nice in northern ca, especially when we were just back from napa!! she prepared everything in the place and the fireplace made us feeling so warm at night. we loved the place very much (it is by far the best one during our trip as we were changing different hotels almost everyday and this place makes us feel home), close to phiz coffee too (definitely try if your first time in sf)!!! parking is not that convenient. street parking is $2.75 per hour from 9am-6pm, but street cleaning on mon. wed. fri. nights. safeway parking is $20 per day, but when there is an event, parking fee will increase. heather knows some other places for parking which is cheaper but need to move the car from time to time. we were too excited that time when we checked in, so we didn\\'t even listen~~ ^.^ heather is great. she replied my emails so fast, so if any questions, just ask!! heathers condo is a well decorated and spacious place. the equipment is very complete and public transport is close, so it\\'s really easy to go everywhere in town. we really enjoyd staying here!this has to be one of the best locations in san francisco.  it has some of the best weather in the city - and some of the best amenities (including easy transportation). heather\\'s condo is away from the noise and bustle yet within very easy reach of all the major attractions.  a short walk from eating places and coffee bars, at&t park, the marina.  this place has it all.  heather is a thoughtful, responsive and welcoming host.\\r\\n\\r\\na minor grumble:  it would have been good to know in advance that the television was disconnected; that would have saved a lot of fiddling with the controls!  even better - give guest the option of paying extra for cable so that they could watch television when they are  relaxing in the evenings.i totally recommend heathers condo. \\r\\nbeing a family of four we had a great stay at a really nice place at a really good location, couldn\\'t be better.\\r\\nheather is wonderful host and super smooth to deal with and gave us a lot of good info on what to do and not to do (like parking on games night) in and around sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nand dont miss to go see the giants when you are in town, just a block away from the condo\\r\\n\\r\\ngreetings from swedenheather\\'s place was awesome, it was very close to many attractions and check in and out was very simple. her condo was spacious and very clean. heather was very responsive with her communication and even put together a list of everything close by. we only traveled by cab and muni and had no problem getting around because of the location and being close by the muni stop. for the price you can\\'t beat it. thanks heather!thanks a lot heather for the use of your beautiful apartment and thanks for your hospitality including the complementary wine that you left for us.  your location was ideal.  you provided us with all the information that we needed regarding san francisco, and more. you were very caring. i would recommend your place to anyone.our stay at heather\\'s condo was perfect in every way. great location, close to public transportation and terrific accommodations. heather is the consummate host. she leaves no stone unturned by providing great recommendations for dining out, hanging out, and details to all the must see sights in san fran. our only disappointment was that we didn\\'t get to meet heather in person!our stay at heather\\'s was comfortable, luxurious & quiet! the neighbourhood is clean, seemed perfectly safe and is convenient for visiting the beautiful city of san francisco (we also visited la and loved it, but sf wins). safeway grocery store and several restaurants within walking distance of the appartment. \\r\\nheather is an amazing host, the binder with tips, maps and brochures was far more extensive than you will find in any hotel. the basket with complimentary bath products was a nice touch. check-in with house manager terrie was smooth, she made us feel welcome (which we needed after a 24 hour trip from holland, huge delay). \\r\\nkitchen seemed well equipped although we didn\\'t use it (too many nice restaurants in sf! :-)). the ferry building (walkable from the appartment) is an absolute must for food lovers.  \\r\\nwould highly recommend staying at heather\\'s! it\\'s our first time that we booked an apt through airbnb and the whole experience was just perfect!\\r\\nwe arrived (party of 4) on one of the busiest weekend of the year (gaints playoff, fleetweek, blue angles show) so the price was extremely low for what we got.\\r\\nheather was very nice, welcomed us with a bottle of wine, call and text for any matter. the apt is fabulous, big, sunny, lots of space, parking options are very close.\\r\\ni\\'d definitely recommend it for any kind of stay. this was the most amazing home away from home that i could have imagined!  heather was the most helpful and accommodating host.  her apartment was impeccable, beyond comfortable, and conveniently located.  it was even more beautiful than the photos suggest.  i only wish we had stayed longer!heather was a wonderful host and her condo is absolutely beautiful and well situated geographically.  she is very professional and everything is handled in a first class manner.   staying at her place was so much better than a hotel and we really got to feel like sf residents.  the next time we\\'re in sf, we\\'ll definitely see if her condo is available. thanks for making our stay a great one, heather!heather was amazing! from the booking process to arrival process, it was nothing short of easy and a great experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nonce i arrived, heather greeted me at the condo with a tour of the place, some basics and the keys. she left such amazing directions that i didn\\'t even have to call or text her with any questions. her place is so warm and inviting, reminding me of my own apartment in nyc, just in san francisco! she had fresh clean towels and the apartment was spotless. the location is super convenient to the muni train- only one block away and a 10 minute ride to downtown. or take a nice walk along the water to the ferry building. there is an amazing coffee place on her block and safeway and walgreens are both literally a block away.\\r\\n\\r\\ni will definitely be staying her when i am back in san francisco.heather was very helpful, place was clean, organized, fresh sheets & towels, lots of convenient amenities. would recommend staying here for anyone who wants their sf base to be in soma/mission bay.this condo is just as advertised; clean, sleek, modern, and conveniently located near a lot of great attractions. within easy walking distance of many amenities.heather was a wonderful host and made sure everything was ready for when i arrived. the location is superb for central sf and offers easy access to rest of the valley via the caltrain station a block away. the condo is great and very welcoming after a long day in san francisco.we enjoyed our stay in the (url hidden) was perfect for our needs.  we will surely use this site again.  thanks heatherwhat an awesome space and location!  heather has a great spot in downtown sf, especially if you are looking to stay near the caltrain, which i was.  it was very convenient to be able to walk downstairs and hop on the train 5 minutes later.  there is plenty of space in the apartment and the kitchen is well stocked.  a great spot!great location. check-in/out super easy. would definately stay again if i co e to sf.great host and property.heather\\'s place is absolutely gorgeous! i had everything i needed available to me and she even included a guidebook that had the \"how to\\'s\", maps, local entertainment, etc. the area is safe and comfortable. i was able to walk through town without a worry in the world. it\\'s super close to grocery stores and local eateries. plus, it\\'s right by the train station. heather was super accommodating and treated me as a friend vs. a business deal. i\\'m definitely coming back here and wouldn\\'t think twice :) thank you heather!really loved staying at heather\\'s place. she communicates well, and it was an easy check in process. the place is great, modern and comfortable and in a good location.  there\\'s a bike share 2 blocks away and i could ride a bike along the embarcadero to work.  loved it.\\r\\ni\\'ve stayed with heather before and will continue to make this my \"space of choice\" when visiting san francisco :) she\\'s an outstanding host and we\\'ve become good friends which totally makes the experience that much better. she\\'s right next to at&t park, has a wonderful walk way that you can run/walk on and enjoy the bay, located right next to lots of shopping, restaurants, activities (bowling is 1 of many) in such a safe and welcoming neighborhood. heather is the definition of hospitality - she\\'s very experienced and genuinely provides that feel during your stay. i highly recommend staying at heather\\'s place as always! :)heather was a wonderful host even making sure an extra bed was prepared for our teenage daughter.  she provided a warm welcome, and all of the information about the neighborhood that we required.  the apartment was super clean and very comfortable.  we loved the location because we attended two giants games and you can see the stadium from her apartment which is only a few blocks away.  if you are going to a game at at&t park this location is hard to beat.  the neighborhood is safe and clean and there is a safeway and many good restaurants and coffee shops near by.  great place to stay, a \"home away from home\" for sure.we booked heather\\'s place for a daylong work offsite for a  group of five, and everything went flawlessly. heather was a breeze to work with was very helpful and attentive to our group needs. her space is beautiful. would highly recommend!so easy to work with! she made it all very simple for our out of country guest.heather was an awesome hostess and the place was exactly as described and as shown in the photos!  great place in soma within walking distance to restaurants and very safe area of town and can see the giants ballpark from the living room.  looking forward to staying here on future trips to sf!  thanks heather!my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our staff in heather\\'s beautiful condo. it\\'s centrally located to transit, blocks from at&t park and a nice base from which to explore all of the city without the craziness of pier 39 or union square. \\r\\n\\r\\ncheck-in was one of the easiest of our dozen airbnb experiences, and she thoughtfully leaves two key fobs for guests. both the guest book and airbnb guide are incredibly helpful with house rules, internet instructions and helpful dining suggestions. stocked with plenty of linens, amazing bedding and mattress (my wife enjoyed it so much we\\'re going shopping this week for a similar model!). \\r\\n\\r\\nparking is great, though there are a half dozen zip car locations in the neighbourhood and uber is always close! we were initially surprised at how rare air conditioning seemd to be on airbnb listings in sf, but after our week, we can understand why. it\\'s completely unnecessary given the strong winds and generally cooler temps, we always slept comfortably (last week of july).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe pictures do the unit justice and we would happily book again. thanks again for everything heather, it was a great pleasure.heather was fantastic to work with!  she responded quickly, even while on vacation, and was efficient in her communications and in setting up our check-in.  her apartment is spacious and comfortable, and even had a desk so i could get some work done during the trip.  the building is modern, the location is great, and we enjoyed running along the embarcadero.  it\\'s also close to public transportation, so you can get around the city easily.  heather provided a very helpful orientation book as well.  we had a hassle-free stay and enjoyed the comforts of home.  heather really went the extra mile and hooked us up with a great napa tour provider, which topped-off our trip with an amazing experience.  heather kept in great contact leading up to our stay which made the process so easy... we attended a giants game which is 2 blocks away, and that sunday went to the 49ers game which we rode the caltrain to and that was only around the corner, so location was perfect for our stay.  condo was probably more space than my wife and i needed but was truly fantastic.  i would recommend the condo to anyone staying in sf and especially anyway needing access to the caltrain or at&t park.. thanks again heather!! you made it very simple for us...what a lovely home to be able to spend a night in!  not only clean, beautiful, and a great/safe location, but really felt like a home away from home.  i was just in for work, and it was the perfect spot - only wish i could have stayed longer. heather was a great host. she even met me early to drop off the bags. the place is great and was very comfy for my 8 day stay. the sheets are the heaviest and thickest sheets i\\'ve ever slept under. the bed was incredibly comfy and promised a good nights sleep everyday. great apartment in a good location. the whole area is undergoing a renaissance and all the buildings are relatively new & modern. the security situation in the apartment was excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nclose to the caltrain & the at & t stadium with the local supermarket just around the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nheather was a very accommodating host and was flexible with both our arrival & departure times. she organized a car park in the building for our stay and was generous with her advice on what to see & do in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a pleasant stay in her apartment though perhaps a little more care in maintaining and preparing the property for a stay which was of the magnitude of three weeks would have made our experience more enjoyable.i booked this apartment for a colleague and he had a wonderful stay.  the apartment was cozy and comfortable and heather was friendly and easy to communicate with.  i would definitely book here again!  had a great experience at heather\\'s condo. the listing was accurately portrayed in the photos. beautiful, modern, contemporary design at it\\'s finest. she made the check in and check out easy to handle, and she was very thoughtful about my stay in general. the information welcome book was a nice touch, and it even had food delivery menus which came in handy.  heather even took the time to set up the dinner table place settings of a small get together i hosted. everything was clean and organized. she responds quickly to messages to make sure that your stay is going well, and you are experiencing a stress free stay. i would strongly recommend anyone who is on the fence to just book it. you won\\'t regret it. heather is a fantastic host. the condo was beautiful and heather was a gracious and professional host. i will definitely book her again.the host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.eric made my first experience with airbnb easy. he kept in touch throughout the process to make sure our group was taken care of. the house is beautiful and looks even better in person. i appreciated how painless this experience was. i would definitely stay here again!perfect stay! beautiful studio! great neighbors. restaurants with in walking distance. amanda was a great host and easy to communicate with. really enjoyed our stay an would highly recommend!! super awesome location! amanda was very accommodating (she left out her hair dryer as i requested) and it was a great place to stay. lots of neighborhood spots; quiet and cozy. amanda\\'s studio is the perfect size for a weekend visit to san francisco.  exactly as advertised, it is quiet, tidy, delightfully decorated, cheerful and convenient.  \\r\\ncoordinating with amanda was very easy and pleasant.  she was extremely responsive via email and/or texts, and her directions, explanations and answers to questions were clear.  \\r\\ni look forward to staying at amanda\\'s place again!!  i put my parents up in amanda\\'s apartment and they loved it.  my parents noted that the apartment is clean, cozy and comfortable.  they also loved that amanda was thoughtful enough to leave some toiletries for her guests.  amanda was also very flexible in coordinating picking up and returning the keys.  all in all, the transaction and service went extremely smooth.  the only downside, if any, is the parking, but no surprises there being sf.host was extremely helpful; house was clean and well-appointed.  lots of space, close enough to walk to restaurants but far enough to avoid the noise\\r\\nmatthew was an extremely helpful and communicative host. he always replied very quickly to any inquiries, he was flexible with our arrival and departure schedule, and provided very detailed instructions to cover everything we needed. the house was bright, spacious, and clean. perfect for a group vacation, large family, or team business trip. bedrooms were large and the beds were super comfortable!    great location on a quiet residential street only 5 mins walk from the heart of the castro.  matt met me at the door and took time to show me around his home and advised me on places to visit in the area. i absolutely loved this big, bright and airy home in the castro district. the apartment overlooks a quiet part of a busy neighborhood. the street had numerous bars, and cafés and an excellent grocery store. everything my family and i needed. there are also some great places of interest to visit with in easy walking distancehost was extremely helpful, house was clean and well-appointed.  lots of space, close enough to walk to restaurants but far enough to avoid the

the back yard was peaceful. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is great! everything you need, lots of interesting shops, and several restaurants are just a few blocks away, or even closer. public transportation stops, if needed are very close by the flat. matt showed me a few places within walking distance that had grand vistas of san francisco, the bay and the ocean. those areas were a welcome bonus!  \\r\\n\\r\\ni have stayed in other places in san francisco and this was, by far, the best location and offered the nicest accommodations. i highly recommend staying here.  i booked myles and matt\\'s places for 7 of my co-workers who were flying into the city for training. myles got back to me immediately on the request and permitted me to book both units in their building in order to make it super convenient for our employees. they each had their own room and lots of space to spread out and they jumped on the muni to our office in the fidi every day, with ease. the instructions in the house were outlined very well, the house was well-kept and very clean and they even provided bathroom toiletries (nice!). i was texting with myles the whole week and felt very comfortable with him as our host. i knew my friends were being well taken care of. thanks for everything- hope you guys had a great vacation!it was a really lovely stay at matthew\\'s apt. started with a very detailed welcome house tour by myles. the apt is a perfect place for a 4 ppl biz trip.\\r\\nwe, a norwegian family of 10, being 6 adults and 4 youngsters ageing 13 to 23 spent 10 days in california travelling up to sfo from la. as an alternative to split into separate hotel rooms in sfo we were lucky to find an alternative by booking this flat with matthew and myles.\\r\\nmyles was also very kind sending us upfront his recommendations to what to explore en route, and what to find of restaurants and shops in the neighborhood of castro, very appreciated. myles met us late when we arrived in the evening and showed us around the flat explaining practical details and house rules. we enjoyed very much the clean and tidy flat with more amenities than we expected and a fully equipped kitchen. the ample living room with the large table was a center point for all family to stay together and the bed there for 2 did not disturb us at daytime at all. all of us felt very comfortable and we can recommend this flat and we will gladly return when/if possible. thank you matthew and myles for having made our stay in sfo so pleasant, very appreciated. \\r\\nthe listing was as described, actually bigger than the pictures make it seem. matthew and myles were extraordinarily accommodating. 10 of us booked the home for 5 nights, the price was very reasonable. we were pleased with our stay, the neighborhood, and will definitely look to stay here again next time we are out there. highly recommend!matthew is a great host. he was welcoming the first day i got to check in to the place. he showed me the place and made sure everything was set before my family came in. would love to stay at their place again. thank you for making my family\\'s trip super comfortable. me and my family stayed at matt\\'s place for about 5 days and absolutely loved it. the location was great, the neighborhood felt safe and welcoming. the apartment was very spacious and sunny! all the beds were really comfortable and the place was clean. the hosts were really accommodating and helpful too!matthew and myles are absolute pleasure to interact with, their responses are timely and clear. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is clean, roomy, and has a lot of natural light which makes it nice and cozy. bathroom and kitchen utilities are complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you matthew and myles for a great stay in san fransisco. great apartment great beds great bathrooms great neighborhood and great hostsmy colleagues and i went to san francisco in order to attend a conference close to union square. from the beginning on, everything went really good and easy with the booking. matt answered quickly and gave us lot of information upfront. also when we arrived, he and myles explained us not only everything about the apartment but also about the area and things to do eg the amazing diner where we had dinner the first night. the apartment is really big, clean and pretty and has everything you need. and also the area is really nice with lots bars, markets and restaurants nearby. it was a pleasure to stay at matthew\\'s apartment: nice historical building at a great part of the city. i stayed with my colleagues and all of us enjoyed the place.\\r\\nmatthew was very responsive and easy to contact in case of any questions what made our stay easy and comfortable.great stay and great hosts! great location in twin peaks, just around the corner to the highest point in san fran (beautiful view!).  nice view as well from the home in a quiet area.  we didn\\'t do any public transport (had a car) but parking was very easy.  amenities in the house were great: good kitchen, lots of space, and both bedrooms were comfortable.  each bedroom has a great amount of privacy as they\\'re quite separated, each with access to their own bathrooms.  wifi and other amenities worked well and were great to have (dan has a great music collection!).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was a good hub for everywhere we went; wasn\\'t more than a 20 minute drive to anywhere in the city.  dan wrote down a great list of places and areas to go (and those that we might want to avoid!).  that and some other field guides, etc. they provided were really helpful.  check-in and meeting them was very easy.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, the apartment was perfect for what we wanted: a great place to hang out and close to all that the city has to offer.  dan was an excellent host and we would certainly go back!the home is definitely comfortable! i felt like i was visiting a friend\\'s house. i enjoyed the chocolate  covered almonds on the coffee table and the extensive book selection. i enjoyed having a cup of morning coffee in the chairs overlooking the amazing view.the bed was firm yet comfy and the teenage girls were downstairs in the second bedroom/den and they had a great time. the two bathrooms were a plus. i would stay here again!daniel was super easy to work with, and the house was just as described. in a residential and quiet neighborhood. loved the open bar downstairs too, very convenient thanks for a great stay!staying here with dan & ellen was our first airbnb experience, it was also our first time in san francisco. we will forever insist that we could not have experienced a better combination of concurrent firsts. even though dan and ellen were away and we had the home to ourselves they found a way to leave their excellent hospitality behind for us throughout their beautiful home. the view was a-blazing with amazing, you can sit on their 2 lovely lazy-boys and watch the whole day happen from there. there is this daily fog pattern and clearing that happens in san francisco and their living room is one of the perfect places to experience it all in complete coziness. the home is on the highest \"peak\" in the city right next to this awesome tower that doubles as a \"fog-mo-meter\" throughout the day, it can be seen from anywhere in the city so if you go up the hill a bit more you will find the absolute best view in the city at twin peaks. listen i can seriously and genuinely gush all day but i need to find a way to end this review which requires that at some point i figure out a way to stop telling you how awesome this place really really is and that\\'s not an easy thing to do. here goes my attempt though, the home is super nice and clean, very well furnished, awesome view, yard with a view and tons of street parking so bring your cars, you definitely don\\'t have to fight for parking like everywhere else in san fran, the main bedroom is as clean as a new hotel suite, i can really go on and on. there is an awesome massage chair which i used daily, dan has a great music collection at your disposal, an apple tv, cable tv, flat screen, see i can\\'t stop... a chemex coffee maker which before returning home from my trip i owned and became addicted to (thanks dan). i always say that the best way to experience a new city is to stay with friends that live there and that is exactly how it felt staying here, like we were amongst friends. they left everything we needed to figure anything out that you could want to know (look out time travel). their lovely home is not ostentatious nor lavish but instead and arguably better it is homey, cozy and beyond comfortable. it\\'s just a great place to experience san francisco from and live like locals in the home of real awesome locals. we wish dan and ellen nothing but happiness and success, they are great people and if you can and are lucky enough to stay with them you should feel honored, i can tell you with all sincerity that we sure did. happy travels everyone. \\n\\nrafael & nadyathe host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the experience living in daniel\\'s house is really awesome! we feel like at home here. inside, it\\'s quite enough to accommodate 4 people, and includes many books, wines and complete daily necessities. outside, the view of the mountain foot and sea is fantastic. besides, the small gifts daniel gave us are heart-warming.our stay in the sf castro house was wonderfull!! \\r\\nthe house is spotlessly clean, fully equipped, warm, bright and the neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. \\r\\nwe had no problems with parking our car on the street.\\r\\nmyles and matt are very kind and friendly. they gave us some great tips about the area and the places to visit. \\r\\nwe´ll recommend the place to our friends and family and if we come back to sf we´ll certainly stay here again!\\r\\ngreat stay, hosts were friendly and helpful and everything was seamless and easy.  i would certainly stay here again in a heart beat.  location was close to anything you need, lots to do etc.  5/5 stars all around - this experience was exactly what i\\'d hoped it would be.  we had a wonderful time staying in myles and matthew\\'s flat in san francisco. we rented the entire flat for our group traveling into the city for an art show. first, the location can\\'t be beat. i lived in san francisco for several years and we continue to travel back to sf on a regular basis. the flat is located on a quiet and safe street - only a few blocks from the muni line which can take you anywhere in the city easily and safely. that also means if you are coming in from the airport, you can take bart to muni and are right there. if you are on foot, there are great restaurants and shops just outside the door and fanning out in all directions. we had a car this trip and parking was very easy. on the next note, the flat was very cute, comfortable and well maintained. the beds were very comfortable and the kitchen was perfect for gathering in the morning to plot the day. the hosts provide amenities like hairdryers and shampoo... things you would find at an upscale hotel. we loved the art in the unit... overall the flat is a quiet sanctuary in the middle of all the city has to offer. obviously we will return and we highly recommend!my family and i had a wonderful stay in this home.  the house was spotless and the furnishings lovely.  the location in the castro was convenient for all that we planned in the city.  i highly recommend this property and look forward to staying there again some day.myles and matthew were excellent hosts and the place was fantastic. it was beautiful and spacious and met our needs perfectly for 8 people. myles met us upon arrival and was extremely friendly and helpful. i would absolutely recommend their apartment to travelers.we had a great stay here.  the location is in a nice neighborhood in the castor area with some good restaurants in short walking distance.  there is a nice grocery store two blocks away which was also very convenient.  the cable car is also only a few blocks away making it pretty easy to get around town fairly inexpensively on public transport.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe accommodations were very nice and the beds were comfortable.  having the kitchen and dishes was nice for eating breakfast and snacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe did have some trouble with the wifi not working for us but matthew did come try to help us out with it even though we were not successful in getting it to work with our iphones or ipads.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend.we had a great stay in the apartment. myles and matthew were very friendly and the apartment was really nice, spatious and clean and it perfectly met the needs of a group of 7 people. the location is also very good for visiting sf. i definetly recommend this flat.myles & matthew were great hosts.  everything having to do with the flat was very clear and well organized.  it was exactly as expected.  we stayed for a week & they were easily contactable the one time we needed input.  we think they do a great job of airbnb hosting.this was my first airbnb experience and myles and matthew didn\\'t disappoint.  they warmly greeted when me when i arrived and made sure i knew where all the essentials were before leaving.  their place was clean and exactly as advertised.  i would recommend them and their flat to anyone looking for a good place to stay while visiting the area.we were in sf for our wedding weekend and had a really great time. the house is located in a great part of the city -- perfect mix of privacy, walkability, and proximity to restaurants and transportation. we really enjoyed morning coffee at la taza and dining at poesia, both on 18th st. myles and matthew were friendly and accommodating and had great suggestions of what to do and what to see while we were in the city. thank you for helping make our special weekend memorable.great location (great in the heart of the castro!) and an ideal space for a large group. each room has great amenities and more than enough space. myles and matthew were also very helpful and allowed us to check in early. i highly recommend!we had a great stay with myles and matthew. the house was everything we expected and more, and is located in a lovely part of san fran. would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the city.the apartment was amazing and it was close to everything in sf. flat was just great - nice 4 bedrooms, very clean and fantastic location. myles and matthew are very nice and friendly guys. it was a real pleasure to rent a flat from those people. we had a really good time there. would like to come back.the hosts were very attentive, easy to talk to and very willing to help. they provided good information and valuable  tips for newcomers.  the description of the flat was exactly as described.  it was very clean, very well decorated, organized and extremely comfortable for my family (8 people).  a great kitchen set-up and a very convenient location that allowed us a very easy access to any part of town.  i would definitely recommend this flat to any family.  having 2 small and 1 full bathrooms was perfect and much appreciated by our group.  this was our first airbnb experience and a great one.  we were welcomed by myles on our arrival and he gave us useful tips about the city and area. he and matthew were professional and responsive throughout the booking process. the neighbourhood feels safe and relaxed and has good amenities. the flat is extremely clean, and the bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. the digital entry system dispenses with keys and is a real plus for convenience. our family all enjoyed our 3 day stay.except for the location which is quite convenient to downtown attractions and the golden gate park, the entire experience in the flat was less than optimal.  there are two bathroom and one of which is very small and under the attic.  the worst experience has come from the lack of sound insulation from the ceiling.  we were unfortunate to have two groups of people with small childrens who were walking, jumping even into the wee hours.  the night before the end of our 4-night stay came the worst.  the new family checked in 1am in the morning, literally waking us all up and keeping making all the noises for 3 hours!  these we believe are largely due to the lack of good sound proof of the flat.  it was a big mistake taking the lower flat.  for the entire 4 nights, we didn\\'t have good quality of sleep, quite unsatisfactory for our family who were trying to overcome our jetleg.  our stay was easy and comfortable.  there were 9 women together and there was plenty of rooms and bathrooms for us all.  the host is easy to work with and responsive.  i highly recommend this host.  the house was awesome, even better than photos. we were a group of 8firends, and we had a great time there. we just meet myles one time, he was very nice to us and gave us many useful advises regarding sf. the house is located 2blocks away from the metro, so it was easy to get to downtown even if we didn\\'t find it particularly easy to visti the city without the car. parking is available nearby. no laundry in the flat. myles and matthew were such a pleasure to work with! my husband and i rented the bottom floor apartment during the weekend of our wedding for members of our bridal party from out of town. the apartment was lovely and our friends had a comfortable stay in a great part of town. the space was more than adequate for our 5 guests and even myself and my husband stayed a night in the apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nfurthermore, myles was super accommodating when we asked to have a backyard garden party for a few friends and family the day after our wedding. he let us use their folding chairs, and he helped move their banquet table from storage.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe could not be more pleased with our experience with this apartment and with myles and matthew.the house was exactly like the pictures. myles was there himself to welcome us and gave us all the information we needed. the rooms are spacious - the beds and pillows are super comfortable! we shared the house between 4 colleagues and it worked out perfectly. the garden in the back is a little gem! the neighbourhood is great - very lively, close to everything including nice restaurants, shops and cafes, as well as easy public transport to downtown. i would definitely stay here again.the flat is in a great location in the castro very near to lots of bars and cafes. the flat itself was perfect for our needs - 4 clean and spacious bedrooms as well as good communal areas. myles and matthew were very communicative in advance of our arrival and although i was not there to pick up the keys they gave my friends a tour of the flat and advice on the local area and transport - i am told they were very friendly. the only downside was the noise of drilling from downstairs in the mornings. thanks guys :-)the host greeted us at the door and showed us around the flat. we were provided with sufficient linens and full kitchen access. all 4 bedrooms were spacious and clean. although we didn\\'t use the backyard, it was a nice amenity to have had. we received suggestions for places to eat and tips for getting around town on public transportation. the location of the flat was perfect and conviniently located to a bus stop, market, restaurants and bars. we had a very nice stay.  myles met me and showed me everything i needed to know about the apartment and the neighborhood.  the check-in process could not have gone any smoother.  the apartment is exactly as described - impeccably clean and well stocked.  we walked easily to and from the castro station; convenient shopping; great restaurants; and overall just a great stay.  i rented the apartment with my coworkers and we all had plenty of space.  i am looking forward to returning for a family trip.  awesome accommodations!  near transportation, grocery stores and restaurants!  myles and matthew were welcoming, the flat was clean and ready as promised.  plenty of room for a group!  you will not be disappointed.myles was a proper gentleman and great host. he was waiting for us when we arrived and provided us with valuable information about the accommodation, surrounding area and san francisco. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe home was very clean, spacious and the beds very comfortable. \\r\\nplenty of space for our party of 6 (4 adults and 2 teenagers)\\r\\n\\r\\npublic transport, shops and restaurants very close. \\r\\n\\r\\nonly negative, was the people above us, (apartment above) could hear them walking/running around at night while in bed. \\r\\napart from that, we would stay again and recommend to other people.        great location and helpful hostwe had a great stay at myles & matthew\\'s house. they both were there to greet us on our first day to show us around, which was a nice touch. the place is lovely. the kitchen was fully equipped, which was

help later on during my stay. as for the house, it was really clean and nice. we were a big group and had enough space for everyone. the rooms and big and gets plenty of sunlight. the neighborhood is

was perfect for the guys weekend.  4 guys golfing over 4 nights/ 5 days.  we all have kids so it was nice to get away for some r&r, peace and quiet, but still be in the city to get out for great food and drinks with friends.  (i am sure our wives would have loved the place as well.) \\r\\n\\r\\nwhy get a hotel?  \\r\\nwe didn’t have to deal with hotel taxes and fees or the valets…. just pulled the rental van into the huge garage, left the golf clubs in the van and walked right in. (its pretty hard to find a garage that big… one where everyone stays in the car and you don’t need to pull in the mirrors.) the patio is also such a great space.  it seems to get just about the right amount of sun and cool breezes. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is great.  walking distance of bars, restaurants and markets. you can even hit the walgreens nearby for supplies.  a nearby cable car stop is also a nice bonus. \\r\\n\\r\\nnotes-\\r\\ni was born and raised in socal.  went to berkeley undergrad.  i still have plenty of friends in the city but they don’t have places like this to accommodate larger groups of people.  i don’t know what the square footage of this is but it works nicely.  couldn’t have asked for anything better in sf.  \\r\\n\\r\\neverything was perfectly comfortable.  thanks ashley and mike for making it a great stay.  \\r\\nthe place is great. very comfortable. ashley & mike are super flexible and did everything they could to accommodate our needs. i left my charger there and they were willing to mail me. it was an excellent experience. our experience at ashley and mike\\'s was just superb in every way!! \\r\\n\\r\\nnot only is the house itself beautifully decorated and conveniently laid out, but for anyone who has driven into the city for their stay, the central location of the home and the wonderful accessibility through and privacy of the garage is perfect !!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthey were fabulous about the communication, answering all our ahead of time questions, giving us a great tour of the place when we arrived and having all the food stuffs we asked for!!\\r\\n\\r\\nit is a quiet home and very peaceful and almost an oasis from the noise and bustle of the city but at the same time it is so close to shopping and restaurants that you could leave the car home and walk!\\r\\n\\r\\noverall it was just a great experience and my family has only the highest recommendations to all future guests who would consider staying with them  \\r\\nthank you so much, ashley and mike!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mike and ashley\\'s place comes as advertised.  it\\'s a great location, very clean and comfortable.  they were also very good communicators.  i highly recommend mike and ashley\\'s place for your next stay in san fran.  staying at ashley\\'s and mike\\'s residence was such a pleasure. a clean, modern house in the heart of the city that is within walking distance from some great restaurants and must see tourist sites. ashley & mike were quick in their responses and went out of their way to make us feel welcome in their home (including providing a microwave within a few hours of us requesting one). \\r\\n\\r\\na great experience overall. ashley and mikes place was a perfect fit for our san francisco trip. beautiful house with a grey rooftop deck locking up to nob hill.  \\n\\ngreat location in a quiet residential street just 5-10 minutes from soma area via taxi, or a quick walk to the cable car stop on hyde.   \\n\\nquiet, clean and fully appointed making it easy to move right in and get about our time in san francisco.  federico made the process smooth and easy, and he was very responsive in all communications. he thought of everything, and even took the time to talk us through some tips of the city upon our arrival. the house was fantastic, with all the amenities you could want, and it was very clean. the location was ideal for a trip to the city. highly recommend! we really enjoyed our stay at arjun\\'s place. the apartment was spacious and very conveniently located, close to bars, restaurants and the piers. we had no trouble getting around the city using the busses and trains, but mostly walking. the apartment has a great view of the sunrise and the bay bridge. everything we needed was provided and arjun was very prompt with his responses every time we needed something. the building is a very nice high-rise and there was access to the pool which we did use and enjoyed thoroughly. looking forward to our next visit :)jeannie and skate crated an outstanding place for travelers coming to san francisco. the house is filled with carefully selected objects which are full of meaning and give a grate vibe, while staying there. we were amazed by the view that this place offers, it is truly breathtaking. spending there a week just passed by so quickly thanks to the amazing hosts. for sure we will try to book this place again while traveling to sf. we rented this house in conjunction with their garden for our wedding in late april. it was very convenient having the entire house, as we were able to have out-of-town family stay on site for the wedding. the house has a sunny living/dining area, lots of color, and a large kitchen, not to mention the enormous and spectacular garden. they do have a cat, and i normally have cat allergies, but it didn\\'t seem to bother me (either i didn\\'t spend enough time inside, adrenaline from getting married, or the wood floors made the difference). the house is up on a hill, which creates a quiet neighborhood and gorgeous views of the city. parking was always easy, as they mentioned. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall, the house is very comfortable, and jeannie & skate were wonderful, welcoming hosts. they live here full time, so the house has a lot of their personality, unlike some of the generic full-time vacation rentals. if you are looking for a place to stay near enough to the heart of the city that you can still get anywhere quickly and easily, but far enough from the hustle and bustle so you can still have some peace and quiet, i would definitely recommend their house as an amazing base for your visit to san francisco. lovely place, fit our requirements and provided a unique experience for our guests and us. the house, the hosts, the gardens - all of it was essential for a unique sf experience.our trip in jeannie, skate and bowie bouse was really great. the place is wonderfull and it was a pleasure to meet its owners. thks a lotstephanie has a beautiful home!

he met with me promptly to get me situated at this place. this was my first airbnb experience and i loved it. the location is great too. there\\'s a walgreens near by, just in case you need to do some shopping for snacks and other necessities. the bart station is one block away.heigo did a great job keeping the house clean, welcome and well supplied. all of the roommates were young professionals and got along great. if you ever needed anything heigo was just a quick phone call away, and would run errands if needed.the host is very nice and the place in a very good condition. it is clean and the gym is brilliant.  for the location, it is even better and it\\'s 5 mins to the city hall and 15 mins walk to union sq.  gatz is an outstanding host and checked in on me multiple times during my stay to make sure everything was going well. as long as you are ok with the hostel experience (sharing a bunked room with 5 other roommates), this place will exceed your expectations. it\\'s basically a luxury 2 bedroom condo in a great building that includes a gym, pool and hot tub. right next to a supermarket so great for longer term stays!i had a great experience at looky 2. the host was responsive and everything was clean and orderly. most importantly, i got uninterupted sleep each night i was there. i would stay here again. heigo was a very nice host. he replied very quickly when i booked on airbnb and welcomed in person when i arrived.\\r\\nthe appartment is very modern and clean. the view on san francisco is amazing. it\\'s a very convenient spot, close from bart and muni stations.\\r\\nthe other guests were very nice. i spent 2 amazing weeks.\\r\\ni definitely recommand that place.pretty awesome place, everything you see in the photos, gatz showed me everything the first day and explained where i could find food and other things nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is in a good location, that made it really easy to just walk from there to the company where i worked from.\\r\\n\\r\\nnot too crowded when i was there, which was pretty good and the house was always clean no matter what.extremely smooth check-in and check-out, very well kept space, other people staying there were incredibly cool. would definitely check-in here again.let me start off by saying this was my first experience with airbnb and living in a shared space. most of the pictures are 100% accurate, even though others may not show the exact view they are very similar, so it is an accurate portrayal of the apartment. the apartment itself has a sophisticated feel to it and i really like where the apartment is located. i found many places to be a walking distance, like the castro or the civic center plaza, with walgreens and a market across the street. gatz is a great host: he made sure we had what we needed and was quick to answer any questions. he has many appliances available for our use, which i found extremely beneficial. i did have a complication arriving, but gatz was very accommodating and quick to help :) thanks again, gatz!we had a great time staying at the looky house. clean, tidy, and appeared as pictured.  housemates were all professionals which probably made the experience of a shared space less intimidating.  unfortunately we never got to meet gatz, but he seemed to stop by and tidy the place up ever now and then as indicated by the empty trash bins.  overall a nice upscale building with quiet comfortable facilities that wouldn\\'t mind staying again the next time i visit sf.  thanks gatz!pretty clean, well organized apartment. met some great ppl at the apartment. no complaints. thanks!really liked the apartment, modern and tidy.

their home is absolutely gorgeous and they really take great care of their guests. they immediately made me feel welcome. they made sure i was well fed, had clean towels and sheets. the house is always immaculate. they were a pleasure to talk everyday when i came home but they also gave me all the privacy i needed. i basically had an entire floor of a very large and luxurious 3 story house all to myself. by the end of the week, i felt like i was at home and jack and christian were family.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mission district neighborhood is one of the nicest in san francisco. jack and christina have one of the best houses in the area so it\\'s a no-brainer - you have to stay with them. there are a lot of hip bars and restaurants within walking distance as well and jack gave me some great recommendations for restaurants, bars and cafes. it\\'s literally a perfect set up!our stay with jack and christina could not have been better or nicer. the house is amazing and their hospitality goes way beyond anything we\\'d ever experienced with airbnb. they provided us with a great breakfast every morning, all the toiletries we could wish for and made us feel like friends. we particularly enjoyed sitting together on the terrace sipping white wine and savouring delicious homemade houmous and tabbouleh. and we made friends with their lovely little dog. a wonderful stay in a great city, perfect location, just great.\\r\\n\\r\\nevery person in our group of seven agreed that sara’s home is incredible! what a beautiful house in a convenient neighborhood. there is tons of space with large rooms and a beautiful kitchen. the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms very clean, etc. the kitchen is light and bright with high end appliances. everything you need is there. excellent restaurants, coffee and shops within walking distance, night life a short uber away, and comfortable sleeping for our entire group, i could not ask for more. the home is even more beautiful than what is seen in pictures.  \\r\\n\\r\\nsara is also an excellent host - she was accessible any time and was eager to offer recommendations and answer questions. she was always very quick to respond and made the entire process very easy. the place and location made for a true sf experience. i cannot say enough good things. i highly recommend and would certainly stay again.\\r\\nwhat a wonderful 5 days in this beautiful, warm, and comfortable home! sara and her husband sean treated us as if we were long-time friends. we stayed here with one other family, and it was more than roomy for the 9 of us.  the house is laid out really well.  kids loved the playroom and backyard; the adults enjoyed the living room and kitchen area.  the 4 bedrooms upstairs are laid out perfectly for 2 families to share. \\r\\nsara and her husband stopped by once we arrived to walk us through the house and make sure we could figure everything out - this was immensely helpful, and incredibly thoughtful.  sara would also text and check in with us periodically to make sure everything was going well.  i texted her several times with minor questions and she got back to me within minutes.  \\r\\nwe were even able to get out for an adult\\'s dinner one night because sara provided us with her babysiter\\'s contact info - and her sitter was wonderful. \\r\\nthe location of her house could not have been better.  truly a perfect location with local fresh groceries, restaurants, cafes, coffee shops, boutiques, etc. within a 5 minute walk, so we didn\\'t need to rent a car or uber for every outing. \\r\\nboth of our families have already agreed that if we return to san francisco, we hope we are able to stay again at sara and sean\\'s home.\\r\\nthey have a beautiful family and a beautiful home.  this is a gem and a family would be fortunate to stay here!!  this space was perfect for our group in town for a three day planning session. the neighborhood was fantastic-everything we needed near by and it was safe and quiet.the house was really nice. sara had arranged everything well! we had a large group staying at sara\\'s home, and it was perfect for accommodating our size & needs! the house was immaculate when we arrived, and sara was so thoughtful to leave us a gift basket for our stay. communication with sara leading up to our stay, and during our stay, was fantastic and easy. also, the location of the house is perfect for those who have never been to the city - it\\'s right near all of the major tourist attractions, great restaurants & shops. we will definitely be back!i had a lovely experience with jose. his home is absolutely lovely, it is very convenient to sf downtown or to the south area. on the night of our arrival, our flight was delayed for 3 hours, he waited for us and picked us t the airport and even waited us to rent our own car, by the time when we arrive, it was already midnight. he was very patient and helpful, made our first day really easy. he also left some food for us. the roof of the house has a very nice view, we love going up there and look at the whole city. i highly recommend this place. house was great.  the host was super nice.  gave great recommendations and even picked me up from the airport!the host canceled this reservation 103 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.kevin and josé were great hosts. very kind every moment. they also picked up us at the airport to receive us. the house is beautiful, just as they show it. we definitely recommend them. it was a pleasure to stay there. thank you!everything was perfect! the house is large, comfortable and clean. i stayed with my whole family and a baby. everything was very comfortable. i highly recommend it. thanks for everythingwhen we arrived the home was just as it was pictured and actually even more spacious.  views are spectacular. the home was very clean and our host provided amenities like soap toothpaste and even some fresh fruit upon arrival.   thank you kevin and jose for sharing your beautiful home with our family we would definitely return and highly recommended for other travelers.i enjoyed my first airbnb experience at kevin and jose\\'s home. above all the beauty of the home and quietness were the most important to me, however we got much more! they have an awesome place  and have nicely and thoughtfully decorated every aspect of  it. the home is quite large, spacious, and very comfortable. the mattresses are very nice! they are very thoughtful and have everything a visitor could think of to make his/her visit comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe home is very quiet, which was so important to me.   the views of san francisco are amazing! however, there is a small price to pay for such a beautiful view; the house sits on a large hill that you have to drive up (which is common to sf). the nighttime views made combatting my fear of heights well worth it. \\r\\n\\r\\nalso, kevin and jose are great and were available throughout the stay, even though they were personally out of town. jason who oriented me to the home was very nice as well. i loved their home and appreciated their thoughtfulness toward airbnb guests. their house manual is quite comprehensive and very helpful.  i highly recommend their place. it is so much better than a hotel!what a great huose!i love san francisco so much in this 5 days.i am a chinese.kevin was very friendly.i can not talking about too much english. this is a best way to live in san francisco with this house.we had a wonderful trip to san francisco. jose and kevin were great and very hospitable. the home was just as we had expected and more. they provided us with everything we could possibly need. the home was very clean and comfortable. the location was perfect with easy access to the freeway. the view from the home was amazing. pictures do not do it justice. i stayed here with a few friends over new years and we absolutely loved it, definitely a must-return if i find my way up to the city again.  the view is better than the photos, even in january. the surroundings are quaint and we loved it, no traffic or late night noise. the neighborhood was welcoming, lots of smiles and waves. there are a few nice parks around but a lack of stores and eateries in the near vicinity. however for a quick bite there\\'s the salad place (great sandos) in excelsior, and some other cafes and small restaurants. the house is spacious and very comfortable. the hosts have done an amazing job decorating and it is quite colorful and lively. the kitchen is well-supplied and there were no lack in amenities. it was very nice meeting them at the beginning of the stay, and they have prepared well for airbnb! very responsible and caring. made sure we we do not face any discomfortmy colleagues raved about kevin and jose\\'s space.  the location was convenient with a fantastic view.  there were lovely little touches in the house - very inviting.  kevin and jose were very responsive, checked in regularly to ensure nothing was needed and were very friendly and easy to deal with.  we would definitely stay here again and recommed it to others.\\r\\n nice house and good view.the public area is large so we six persons can play together.the massage armchair is (url hidden) is just take ten mins drive to the downtown.the location is good.kevin and jose were in england during our staying the house.but it was so patience to answer our questions and fix our problems immediately.房子处于坡上,景观非常好,尤其夜景,装修很有格调,有ps3和按摩椅,男士可以玩ps3,女士逛街累了可以用按摩椅,不错的体验。离市中心开车十分钟的路程。方便。the flat has the wonderful view of the whole city. so many household electrical appliances make everthing convenient as at home. and it is not far to the airport.great experience. we stayed at kevin and jose\\'s listing the week of april 17th 2016. the house was just right for our family of six. \\r\\n\\r\\nlocated a quick uber ride from all the things we wanted to do in sf, the neighborhood is the up and coming residential portola area, with a great mix newer storefronts (upscale coffee shops,  etc), and old school neighborhood standby\\'s (the mom and pop corner convenience stores, the chinese and vietnamese markets, etc)    \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was in decent shape and the views from the top of the hill they live on are really beautiful (especially at night).\\r\\n\\r\\noverall i would recommend this house to anyone looking for a practical and comfortable base of operations when visiting san francisco. we loved jose and kevin\\'s place, nice view and spacious.  the location is great, close to city center, close to highway...communication was great.  we will stay there again...thank you jose!gorgeous house with a gorgeous view!

 the photos don\\'t do it justice. the home was pristine, beautifully decorated and the location could not have been better, it also included a private outside courtyard, which was a pleasure to use. everything was within walking distance (great shopping, excellent neighborhood restaurants, ups, ...). \\r\\nwhen we arrived there was a lovely bottle of wine waiting, coffee, a fridge with condiments, the bedrooms were luxurious and the bathrooms well supplied.  the availability of the car was a pleasant bonus which we used - however parking in s.f. is difficult and we found that using the uber car service phone app worked equally as well.  lisa and larry provided us with a guide to their home and were always available and helpful.  their housekeeper, juanita was pleasant and very efficient.\\r\\nwe would highly recommend this listing to anyone who wants to experience a neighborhood while staying in an elegant s.f. victorian.lisa is an extremely gracious hostess.  she was very helpful helping us to prepare for the visit, and when we needed help during the visit she was immediately accessible.  in short, she was a joy to work with throughout the stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is in a wonderful location in sf with easy access to restaurants, parks, shopping and amazing views.  we basically walked everywhere.  its also conveniently located near several major bus lines, and the ability to use the fiat occasionally was nice as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house itself has a very spacious master and master bath, and 2 very large bedrooms on the second floor.  the bottom floor has a formal sitting room, a casual tv room, a formal dining area, a spacious kitchen and a cozy courtyard.  the kitchen has everything you would need and want at your own house.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe are a family of five with mom, dad, 4 year old boy, and twin 1 year olds.  there was plenty of space for all of us, and while the house is not setup for kids specifically it also worked very well for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe would not hesitate to stay there again!lisa was a great host.  very welcoming and easy to communicate with.  the house is in an ideal location near great restaurants and alta park.  we loved the french feel to the house and the backyard as an added benefit.  we would definitely rent this house again from lisa.great house, great location, great owner!  everything was as described in the listing.  the house is super-clean, comfortable, very nicely decorated.  the fiat 500 and the parking situation are a huge convenience.   awesome experience all around!   we stayed, my wife, baby and mother for 3 weeks at lisa\\'s house.\\r\\nan overall great expérience. i would rent the house again for our next trip to sf in a hard beat. no need to look further, great value, great location and a wonderful house.sakshi made sure that i had everything i needed, and her roommates were also super helpful and considerate!this is the best location in san francisco.  the house is awesome.  if it is available, book it and you won\\'t regret it. angelo is very helpful and will go out of his way to make sure you are comfortable. we have stayed in several short term rentals in san francisco and this was by far the best.  the place was perfect for our group of 6.  great location with lots of choices of restaurants, coffee shops, etc within easy walking distance.  plenty of street parking for our rental car.  angelo was very helpful and easy to work with.  would definitely rent again!\\r\\nwe had a fabulous time in the city and having this house for the weekend was the cornerstone to our event being a huge success! angelo and his staff were extremely clear and timely with communications and the house was in tip top shape from floor to ceiling with all the amenities you can think of.  this is a one of a kind, luxury home in one of the best neighborhoods of sf.  if you are planning on a trip to sf and need a fantastic residence to call home-base, this is the location to choose.  thanks angiolo, your home is incredible!! had a great stay at angelo\\'s flat in pacific heights. what an amazing space!!!! lots of room for my team of business travelers and packed with amenities and very comfy for a three night stay. my team loved the spacious kitchen, the awesome set of televisions and the breakout spaces all over the apartment for working. angelo was a top notch host, who worked very closely with me to meet the moving target of a check-in and extended himself as much as possible on our check out. beyond the house, the neighborhood was fantastic too, with many bars, restaurants and shops literally within a block or two of the place. we look forward to staying here again in the future. thanks angelo! amazing place. location is fantastic, as is angelo! the house was wonderful. beautiful bathrooms, kitchen and master bedroom! a great place for a big group in san fran. angelo was super helpful throughout our stay. tvs, apple tv in every room, fast internet.....if you want to stay connected , it\\'s great!

we enjoyed staying there so much that we can\\'t wait to come back soon and stay at the same place!beautiful place and friendly and accommodating host! our group loved it and would definitely recommend to others. angelo was a great host! the flat itself was beautiful, spacious, well-kept, and tastefully furnished. the location was great - so many places to eat and shop, with some amazing little boutiques that i loved. we also really appreciated that angelo allowed us to take our time checking out on our final day. all-in-all, it was a great birthday weekend!very nice apartment which retains some lovely architectural features. situated in an attractive neighbourhood offering plenty of cafes, shops and restaurants. four of the beds are bunk and the two doubles share a bathroom making this best suited for a family. no laundry facilities but otherwise well equipped.angelo was a great host and made us feel very comfortable. he was incredibly responsive and accommodating leading up to the trip. his flat is gorgeous. it is located in a great neighborhood and nicely furnished. i will definitely stay with angela again. great home. great neighborhood.  all of the public rooms and kitchen were great.  some of the bedrooms were small.  but overall it was a great place to stay. host was very attentive, fixed any small issues and even dropped by to offer us some coffee. great home, everything was as pictured and clean. \\r\\n\\r\\nclarification on the beds and bedrooms: two rooms have only one bed, the two other rooms have a few more beds in one room. we could not have been happier with our stay! angelo was great. the apt is beautiful. we kept saying its way too nice for a rental. beds super comfy with super soft sheets. most important though is the location. right at the edge of all the shops and restaurants on fillmore! cannot recommend enough! great house, great neighborhood!we had a lovely stay. the place is in the perfect location and condition. lovely quiet neighbourhood, with great restaurants and shops around the corner. everything in the apartment looked brand new, extremely well maintained, and most import of all, spotless clean. extremely comfortable beds and bedding items (double rooms) angelo made sure we had all we needed at all times, going above and beyond to make us feel at home. highly recommended.we - a family of six - had a great stay in angelos appartment located in a nice area. the appartment is iarge and spacious but a bit dark. newley renovated with very impressive kitchen and bathrooms. angelo was a great host, quick to respond and generous. angelo personally welcomed me when we got to the home. the place had very modern technology and angelo\\'s close proximity made it easy to get any questions answered. we had a lovely time staying at julia and lauren\\'s beautiful home. the apartment is centrally located in the trendy mission district, surrounded by a large amount of funky restaurants and bars. the apartment is beautifully furnished with two large bedrooms and plenty of room for the three of us to comfortably stay. the girls left a book with lots of recommendations of things to do in the area, many of which we tried. a highlight was the street art tour of the mission districts (a must for art lovers) and the spice jar restaurant (just around he corner). \\njulia was great to communicate with, answering all questions rapidly and with helpful information. \\n\\ni would highly recommend staying here. you are in the heart of the mission district in your own little oasis. the bottle of wine that was left for us was a bonus and a lovely touch. thank you. i booked this for my husband while he was working in the city. overall a good experience. make sure you can be in on check in day before 9 pm. cameron and chris were excellent hosts -- very communicative, welcoming and helpful.  their house is beautiful and the rooms were very comfortable!the place is fantastic! the house is beautifully renovated, well équipped and located in a very nice part of san francisco. tara has been very nice and effective with the proper instructions for her place. \\nwe definitely recommend this victorian gem. tara\\'s house is fabulous! it\\'s spacious and beautifully decorated. the large living and kitchen spaces are sunny and bright, and perfect for family gatherings. the location is within easy walking distance to shops, restaurants, whole foods and the j train. we had a great family vacation and recommend it without reservation.it was easy and quick! she is very easygoing :) working with katie on this at the last minute for me could have been stressful.  but it was not so. katie asked  me a few things, i asked her and we were rocking. all done in one day. nice pad, clean good location. stairs seemed to get stepper the more i drank!   great stay with melissa. i arrived past midnight due to plane delays and she was still very friendly and welcoming. i didn\\'t see her much, but she was always happy to help when needed and always up for a chat regarding her travel experiences and providing useful tips. quiet  neighbourhood but was conveniently located - close to muni, golden gate park, restaurants and ocean beach. thanks for the last minute stay! the reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the place is very quiet and close to ocean and golden gate park. very good place to travel west sf. the host is also \\n very enthusiasm.the room is very nice and it is as it looks at the photos. melissa was very nice as well. it was a bit cold at night and the area a bit far away from the touristic spots but because of this the room is less expensive than other rooms. it is connected with another room so we had the chance to talk to the others guests. melissa was very accommodating and friendly. the neighborhood is excellent being really close to the ocean and golden gate park. it was a last minute booking and melissa was wonderful in communicating with us, and we were relieved with the instant acceptance.  she even invited us to join her out on the town and upon request recommended several places to eat in the area we were in.  the place was a little out of our way, but it was nice to see that part of town, as we had not had a chance to see that part.  we were up early the next morning to catch our flight home so we were very happy to have a place to sleep and get a nice warm shower.  would stay here again under similar circumstances.  melissa was a great host. she was very friendly and after she showed us the room she let us have our own space. however if we needed anything she was more than happy to help out. we also had a lot of stuff ( bikes and surfboards ) but melissa let us store it all in her front entrance. the place is by golden gate park and there is also a good coffee shop, organic market and mexican place a few blocks away. we found that having our own bikes was very beneficial. also, just down the road there is a beach that you can surf at! that was a big surprise and probably one of the highlights of our trip.i have a good experience in melissa\\'s house the place is fine and has a good location just 20 min in bus from the golden gatemelissa is a very nice person. she helped us with everything. we used her room for three days. it\\'s very comfortable, clean and near to the beach. i think it\\'s bigger thank the pictures show. next time i will stay there again. :-)melissa was a great host, full of useful tips and incredibly friendly!  the space wasn\\'t very private at all as there were other rooms off our bedroom and people needed to cross our room to get to the bathroom or out of the house, but she did warn us about that.  it\\'s a little out of the way but totally fine if you have a car or want to use public transit, and the house was very close to the beach and golden gate park.melissa was very nice and enthusiastic upon our arrival. she pointed out the utilities and necessities we could use during our stay. her location is very residential which was awesome for meeting locals at bars and restaurants. she had everything written out which was sometimes a little hard to interpret but other than that the space is good for its affordable price.cute neighborhood! very cute place! melissa sadly wasn\\'t home when we arrived, but her husband was very welcoming and helped my boyfriend and i settle in just fine! the home is in a nice area, very close to the beachfront and golden gate park. our stay was quick but we really enjoyed ourselves! :) melissa is a fantastic host!!!! the room is great and very close to the sea front and the golden gate park. its well lit, cozy, quiet and spacious. melissa works very hard to make her hosts feel comfortable.\\r\\ni stayed here with my parents for two weeks. in that short time she became best friends with us! she was very cooperative and always eager to help. she made our trip very memorable. thanks melissa!!melissa was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for local coffee (devil\\'s tooth is a great coffee house/bakery near the beach).  she obviously works hard and likes meeting people. our vist in melissa\\'s house was a very good time. she\\'s a very enthusiast person and agreeable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room is clean, comfortable. nothing to say. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe recommend this place without one hesitation.the place was really nice and melissa was very accomodating ! thank you for this nice stay :) melissa and her family are very nice. we spent two nights at her house and we felt really comfortable. melissa helped us to find the next metro and grocery store and if we had some more questions then was it no problem to ask her. she was always nice and happy and we are glad to know her. thanks a lot melissa!! :-)spacious and nice room and very kind and accommodating host. easy to take a bus to visit downtown. thank you, melissa!very nice lady we chatted it up ate at a nice thai place that she told us was rad melissa was welcoming but the space wasn\\'t exactly what we were expecting. the ballet room is a main thorough fare for not only the people you share the space with, but also with another \"private room\" where two other different families were staying. you can hear everything that melissa and her family (including dogs) do upstairs, and they keep pretty late hours, so finding a quiet moment is hard. the sofa bed, which my friend and i shared - was the most uncomfortable bed (you can feel every spring and it slopes terribly). my other friend in the top bunk bed fared a little better. you have to walk a fair, but very do-able distance, to reach restaurants and the park. the ocean is pretty accessible. the bathroom and kitchenette were kept pretty clean. overall, if you want a place to crash for a night, it\\'s for you! if you\\'re in a group though, the space gets very cramped. in addition, the wifi never worked - so don\\'t count on being able to use it. melissa is a great host.  she is friendly, helpful, and well organized.  the location is fantastic - close to golden gate park and the ocean, safe, and easy to locate.  the room is great for anyone who likes people and is flexible.  it\\'s clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced.  we truly enjoyed our stay our hope to come back again.  thanks melissa,  maryann and boysmelissa was very nice in that when we first arrived, that place was pretty messy. she gave me the heads up a few days prior that the room may not be ready until 5pm but after a long day of traveling, my friend and i were just hoping for a place to sit down for a minute and relax but there wasn\\'t room to do that. we also did not have towels ready to shower. while she did clean once she got home and made the bed with clean sheets, we were particularly turned off by the fact that the kitchen smelled terrible (don\\'t expect to cook there). the cleaning fee here doesn\\'t make that much sense but it is what it is. the most important thing i want to write though, is this: if you say here, be aware of noise. their walls are very thin and you can hear everything upstairs (kids, dog, etc). we couldn\\'t get to sleep until midnight when everyone eventually went to bed. the noise level was crazy. it didn\\'t feel like anyone really cared that there were four people sleeping in the basement because of how loud everyone was shouting and running around upstairs. we didn\\'t particularly feel happy about staying here but it\\'s worth noting that if you\\'re going to be out and about anyway, you might not mind any of what i mentioned above. melissa was kind in person and happy to provide help on where to go/what to see. it just really depends on what you\\'re looking for, but unfortunately my friend and i may have made a mistake choosing this particular location.driving to melissa\\'s place i realized we stayed a bit further than i would have liked to the touristy type of stuff we would be doing but it was nice that there\\'s public transit close by. \\nmelissa is a nice helpful lady who did her best to help us feel comfortable. \\nit is a shared place as her ballet room is designed for four people plus she\\'s got that side private room. the place seemed organized as she had a board with useful city info which she reviewed with us. we brought our own pillows. beds were nicely made with everything and she welcomed us to her bath and face towels. she\\'s got a small kitchenette: fridge, coffeemaker, microwave, toaster for your use. downside to our stay was that the wifi went down or just not up a couple times during our stay. once letting her know, she asked her kids who were gaming to reset or get off. their reacted by yelling loud at her and stomping (they are upstairs you are downstairs and hear lots of footsteps) as they didn\\'t want to get off. it made me and my two teens feel very strange but hey i figured you get what you pay for so deal.\\ni guess if you\\'re on a budget, this place will get you by. because it\\'s my first time in a shared set up, i learned this is not for me. \\ngreat place that was situated close to the public transport system. had no issues with the bathroom even though there were 4-5 guests sharing it every night. it was also very clean and tidy when i arrived. \\n\\nas for melissa, while i did not meet her much except for the time i arrived, she was very helpful and was always quick in replying my messages.\\n\\noverall an excellent experience at a great price! we had a wonderful 3 day stay at melissa\\'s. the neighbourhood was lovely. quite quiet and a short(ish) walk to ocean. \\r\\nthe room was perfectly fine. not high end luxury but was good for what we needed. melissa was really friendly and really helpful and she answered all our questions and gave some great recommendations for local places to eat! (we went to the thai place and it was amazing!)\\r\\n\\r\\nsomething to be aware of is that if there is someone else staying in the other room then they have to walk through your room to get out or to the bathroom so it\\'s not a very private room! but if that doesn\\'t bother you you\\'ll be fine! we were in the pull out sofa bed and it dips in the middle a bit so not the best nights sleep ever but melissa very kindly bought a nice mattress cover to make it more comfortable. it was close to local transport that took about an hour to get into the main parts of sf. also the wifi doesn\\'t like some iphones which was a bit frustrating!\\r\\n\\r\\ndefinitely recommended if you\\'re looking for a cheap place to stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks!\\r\\nmike and beccamelissa was very welcoming on our arrival. she kept me updated on everything. made us feel at home and at ease the entire time we stayed. the room was very neat and clean when we arrived and throughout our stay. she respected our privacy but made sure we had everything we needed. the room itself was a bit small considering the pictures, but nonetheless, we felt the room size was adequate to our standards. the beds were very comfy and clean and the sheets. we would definitely come back and stay with melissa again. it was great to stay at melissas place. it was very clean, the wifi was working really well and she was very helpfull with everything. we loved that melissa had made a list of\\ngood restaurant in the local area she could recomand - we try a thai-place and it was so good! we would defently stay at melissas place again if we come back to san fransisco :-) the location was  a 20 minute walk from the park and/or any type of restaurants - it was located in a residential area.  the room was not in the house, but was a space added to the garage.  there was a second room which was also rented and that room only had access to toilet, shower and the front door by going through the first room.  we found this disturbing as the \"access\" required the guests in the second room to walk within 6 inches of the bunkbeds and 1 foot of the pull out couch when going to the bathroom, coming home to their room or basically going anywhere.  not really conducive to sleeping comfortably. the couch bed had a mattrass with the box springs literally coming out through the mattrass. the windows do not have shades or curtains which means sunlight into the rooms from 5am in the summer. the picture on the web is also deceptive as it is taken into a full lenght mirror which makes the room look much bigger then it is.  we learned later that this is why it is called a ballet room (ballet requires a mirror - probably clear to ballet afficionados?) - this could have been made clearer.  this is by far the worst accomodation we have seen and we warn potential renters to be very careful before agreeing to stay here.  the refund policy is very \"strict\" and the owner does not deviate from policy.  the owner stated that the entire \"studio\" could be rented for double the listed price, but it was unclear if that would  mean that there would be no guests in that second room, so that the first room would be spared the inconvenience of being a \"hallway\" for the second room?melissa is very nice. she answered every question we had and recommended a lot things we can do in san fran. it was a wonderful time. we met nice people over here.melissa was great! check-in was fast and very accommodating, as we were attending a nearby festival. there was plenty of street parking and the neighborhood felt very safe. every bed was taken, but that was understandable due to the events that were happening over the weekend, but the price was the most reasonable for the location. there was a shared bathroom and kitchenette which was convenient. a grocery store was a couple of blocks away, and while we didn\\'t use it, public transportation was also nearby. the rest of the guests staying there were also very nice and respectful. melissa would always ask how were were doing and made sure we were having a good time whenever we crossed paths. i would definitely book with melissa again if i ever needed to stay in the area.my friends and myself really enjoyed our stay at melissa\\'s place ! we had really interesting talks with melissamelissas place is great! we just slept there one nigh. everything was clean and tidy. the communication with her was great, shes very friendly and fun to talk. its a quiet neighbourhood and close to town. i highly recommend to stay at melissas place! melissa and her husband are very welcoming. we had an excellent time in their house. they gave us a lot of good advices to visit and enjoy san fransisco. melissa also spent time with us and it made our stay memorable !melissa was a great host with a comfortable room shared with other guests. when there where questions she helped and gave tips for sf. it was a wonderful time! thank youmelissa was a very hospitable host and a very nice lady. our room was clean as was the bathroom. she made sure that our stay was enjoyable and even brought down dogs for us to play with. the room is in a very nice, safe and beautiful location of san francisco and i\\'m glad that we picked melissa to host us.we found hair that did not seem to belong to her and definitely not us, in our beds which made us wonder if she had changed the sheets. we were disappointed with the room, despite knowing it would be shared. there was no place to lock in belongings, such as computers or passport, so we carried that around as we did not know the people staying in the private room (who also forgot to lock and close the door to the backyard). we were told not to leave things on the floor due to rats, which felt unsanitary. \\r\\nwe stayed in sf for 3 nights as a part of our california trip. we thought the location was central but it took 40 minutes by car to the city and the area we lived in had some chinese restaurants (chinese neighborhood). safe neighborhood to park the car in though, but it was street parking. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.it was easy to get your way around. plenty of food and a well stocked supermarket just couple of blocks away. the ocean beach was also kinda near. go for a run, stop for a coffee in the morning, and head to the city.had a great stay and met great roomates. melissa was very receptive to suggestions and genuinely wanted our stay to be comfortable. the space was a bit smaller than expected but we still had a good time.we stayed for six nights. melissa is very friendly and our communications prior to arrival was very good. \\r\\n\\r\\nif you need a place to crash for the night this place is perfect. if you want a quiet place were you can hang out this is not it. \\r\\nsometimes there was quite a lot of noise from upstairs if you tried to get to bed before 11pm. since it\\'s a shared space you kind of get what you pay for. no privacy unless you are in one of the separate rooms. \\r\\n\\r\\nhaving said that we enjoyed our stay. for our purposes this worked fine! melissa is a great host and this is very affordable. \\r\\ngood apartment. we lived in a small private room and we liked it. the room cozy and warm. the owners are very hospitable and kind people. the area is very quiet and peaceful. near the ocean. thank melissa!i stayed in this room with two friends. we were exploring sf with local friends in the area. melissa was an excellent host! super friendly and very welcoming! it was easy to communicate with her and she responded quickly to make sure we were all set to go. she definitely did a great job at making the place feel like a home from home for us. she also provides a bunch of cool spots to check out and gives great recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is awesome. the house is right next to the ocean and you can see the water from the front of the house. the beach is about a 15 minute walk from the house. there are also a lot of really good beach restaurants and cafes nearby within walking distance. golden gate park is also very close, maybe a 25 minute walk away. the sunset district is nice, as it is quiet and a little bit more residential, but still close to downtown and many activities. it was nice to go traveling around the mission, financial district, or pier and then come back to the quiet serenity of sunset. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe shared room is spacious and the beds are very cozy. it was hard sometimes to wake up and get the day started as the beds were pretty comfy. the room has a hostel feel to it; there are two private rooms connected to this main room. there is only one bathroom shared between a potential six airbnb occupants, but my friends and i never had issues waiting too long to use the bathroom. everyone was respectful, and in and out pretty fast. \\r\\nthe kitchen has a lot of utensils, sink, microwave, and fridge. only downside was there is no stove so keep that in mind when planning meals for the week. everything was kept clean when we came in and even on a day to day basis. it was nice coming back to a clean kitchen, room, and bathroom in the evening. wifi is really good. for those interested, we rented a car and were always able to find parking very near the premises. you don\\'t need any sort of pass or permit to park on the streets in the area so that\\'s a huge plus.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this was a fantastic airbnb experience and i would recommend this location, as well as melissa as a host to all!anna was very accommodating to our last minute party. the space was great and was large enough to hold aprox 40 people. i would definitely rent it out again. thank you for a wonderful evening. this was the perfect space for our quaint wedding reception.\\r\\npetite and simple with a modest yet stylish decor.\\r\\nthe space and staff where easy to coordinate with and provided everything we needed for our use of the space.\\r\\nwe\\'re very happy to have found this special place.anna was easy to reach when we arrived and opened the space right away, it was clean and exactly as the photos reflect. anna\\'s space was great for our company offsite. easy to coordinate and perfectly prepared for our arrival. thanks for everything!this was one of the nicest airbnb\\'s we\\'ve stayed in, because this is ziyan\\'s actual house and not just an extra space that she rents out. it truly feels like a home, so i highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in san francisco!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe condo was beautiful and very spacious. it had two large bedrooms, a big living room that could work as a third bedroom, and a very roomy kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nziyan was a wonderful host - she was very responsive and helpful. we loved this neighborhood; it was central with so much to within walking distance, yet peaceful. there are tons of transit lines within two blocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you for a very enjoyable stay. if we come back to san francisco, we will definitely stay here again!this was my first stay with airbnb, and saril was an extremely helpful and welcoming host! i checked-in late, and saril was there to greet me. since i stayed only for a night, we didn\\'t have a lot of time to chat (which was a bummer since we hit upon a lot of cool topics in a small time).\\r\\nthe room was exactly as shown - clean and very comfortable. there was also a very good collection of books in the room (unexpected bonus)!\\r\\ni\\'d most definitely like to visit again, hopefully for a longer stay!!saril and his girlfriend have been nice hosts, they gave us some good advices for visiting the city and they let us use laundry. room and house were very nice and clean and even if the view on the bay wasn\\'t as we expected and breakfasts not provided we had a good time. not walking distance from the main attraction and neither from bars, restaurants.. but well connected with bus service and free parking avaiable.saril and his wife were very nice and accommodating. the room was great! and they have the most adorable little dog. i wished i was staying longer so i could have enjoyed the accommodations more!saril welcomed us in (with stella, their adorable dog). we also got to meet his gf martha later in the day. they were all very nice. the room was as pictured, clean and had just the right space and privacy. amenities as listed were provided.\\r\\n\\r\\ni specially appreciate how saril has been very responsive to my inquiries before booking, and continued to be so during our whole stay at their place. it was just unfortunate that we had to check out at 5:30am on our departure day because saril and martha had an early morning flight. quite inconvenient, but it was what it was and we understood the situation.saril and his girlfriend wet very welcoming and accommodating during our 2 night stay. the house, at first appears to be not quite as well located as anticipated but it\\'s actually in a really cool part of town that is close to attractions but still has a suburban feel. the room itself is perfect with a very comfortable memory foam bed, television and good sized bathroom with slightly obstructed view of the bay off of dogpatch. very close to the airport ($11 uber pool ride) we stayed with our dog who had tons of fun despite not being quite as nice as she should have been to saril\\'s little angel stella. thanks for the lovely visit!i stayed at saril\\'s place for a week while i was travelling for work. the location of his place was perfect for me being a 7 minute walk to the caltrain station, whist being a short cab ride to great restaurants and bars in san fransisco. the room was spacious had a very comfortable bed. saril and martha were really friendly and chatty, as was stella, their cute dog who was also happy to come over for a pat.\\r\\nthis was my first airbnb stay, and i had a fantastic experience! saril was very accommodating and friendly, and his home was the perfect place to relax and unwind. the room was great, and there were some great restaurants in the general area. and the dog was lovely :)saril & his girlfriend were very welcoming & friendly.  saril offered to carry our luggage etc. their little dog stella was cute. the room was as expected. there was tea & hot chocolate available. we were in san francisco to attend a wedding & his property was very close to the wedding venue. we were very happy about that! the room was generally clean.  we liked the view. we took a long walk to fisherman\\'s wharf & back.everyhting was just perfect! the hosts, the welcome, the location, the room... it\\'s been a real pleasure to stay at saril\\'s home. thank you very much :)it was lovely to stay at saril\\'s. the place was exactly as advertised and had a lot of charm. saril was kind enough to accommodate the check in times to fit my very busy schedule. \\r\\noh, and the iphone door key was very convenient. all in all a great time in sfo. this was a lovely place to stay only a short walk away from the caltrain station at 22nd street. saril and martha were very welcoming and their place felt really homely. stella their little dog is super friendly and fun! the room was big and spacious and had everything i needed – i would definitely return if i’m ever back in san fran. thanks guys!it was a lovely week staying with saril, martha&their cutest dog stella,they are super nice people. i had a big bedroom with my own clean&well equipped bathroom,towel,showing stuff all provided,they have a well equipped kitchen as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is very close to our new office,if the office is still there by the next i visit,i would definitely choose to stay with them again.great room, great people! no problems whatsoever!saril and martha were really fun and nice and i love their dog. the room was clean and big and has a great desk and the bed was very comfortable. if you don\\'t have a car it may be tricky to get food to bring back to house. there is one cafe that is about 5 minutes away.great location, was just minutes from mission area and the downtown area.  was an easy drive to any location we decided on our itinerary.  we had our rental care so we didn\\'t utilize any public transportation. parking was not an issue at the condo.  saril was a great host and made our stay very comfortable.  they offered great tips on restaurants as well as destinations. we definitely would stay here again when returning to the bay area. saril and martha are two of the nicest people on airbnb. the listing is as exactly as portrayed and then some. the bedroom is comfortable and spacious, equipped with a closet, full bath, and desk! they were great enough to provide coffee, tea and water upon arrival. what\\'s not shown via photos or description, is there super cool gaming center in the bedroom (which we did not have the liberty of taking advantage of). the neighborhood is gorgeous during the day, and quiet at night (beware of skunks). the apartment is walking distance from many of the cafes and brunch spots mentioned. staying here you are 10-15mins driving distance from mission and 15-20 from the downtown area, and there\\'s public transportation nearby (bus stops right not the corner). although i am not a dog person, i loved stella. she was extremely well trained and polite. we even had a little cuddle session. i will definitely be returning if i\\'m back in san francisco. my experience with saril was incredible! i was able to unlock and lock the door easily with the kevo app. saril and his fiancée were very accommodating and a fun couple to hang out with! lastly, saril knows his way around the city and helped out with directions to key areas of the city. i will definitely request to stay with saril again in the future!a large and clean room, in a beautiful home with excellent hosts. highly recommend.the room was exactly as described. saril and his girlfriend/wife (not sure) were very nice and welcoming. i felt very comfortable there. even had a conversation about the area and food because i plan on moving to the city soon.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat host, would easily recommend and even go back to stay again.\\r\\n\\r\\nps: the bed is amazing..saril and martha were very welcoming and our dog also had a great time with their dog. the place was as described and we would def stay here again in the future. excellent stay!

the apartment does get a small bit of noise at night, but it\\'s fine if you keep the windows shut.\\r\\n\\r\\npatrice made our stay very easy and relaxing and we met him at the end so can say he is a lovely guy. also, check out tempest bar up the street if you like dive bars.loved the location of the apartment, 5mins walk from union square, public transport (incl. the famous historic cable cars) and copious amounts of retail therapy if that\\'s your thing. we  also liked the fact that the area is quite busy and well lit at night so we felt comfortable/safe walking home at night. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft/guest bedroom is as advertised, modern, clean and very private plus plenty of natural light (big tick)! however, what made our stay was patrice\\'s warm hospitality - great recommendations on food (esp. ramen!). we\\'d definitely not hesitate to stay here again. patrice is a wonderful and charming host. i was in san francisco for work, and the location of this apartment/loft is absolutely perfect - if you are going to moscone center, the yerba buena gardens, union square. it\\'s also close to bart/muni. \\r\\n\\r\\npatrice gets 5 stars from me (and i would give more if i were able to). the location of this apartment is amazing - if you are going to a convention at moscone center, this is such a great spot to be able to come back home during the day and work or relax. \\r\\n\\r\\npatrice was super awesome and friendly and very responsive via text (which i wildly prefer) when i had a question. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend staying there.patrice made the stay easy and very comfortable. we pretty much had the whole beautiful loft to ourselves the entire weekend and were very comfortable. the location is perfect for partying in the soma / folsom areas, shopping in union square, and getting to bart / muni for exploring castro and the rest of the city. we got parking on the street right by the entrance to patrice\\'s place and had no problems with that. patrice is a great host and a nice guy too!perfect week in san francisco with a perfect host!

\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile patrice lives there (on the first of three stories) he was almost invisible -- very little trace of him. overall a really good experience at a really nice place. patrice was a super welcoming and wonderful host!

very spacious and felt like i had the place to myself most of the time.  great experience.i stayed at patrice\\'s place while in san francisco for a conference at the moscone centre. it was perfectly located, and everything was exactly as described. i only met patrice a few times as i was out most of the day & evening at the conference, but he was extremely friendly & helpful. i felt completely at home. i would be happy to recommend the place to anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nbe aware that there are quite a few steps to climb to the apartment, so bear that in mind if you are arriving with a lot of heavy luggage.patrice is a very nice guy, i can only recommend staying with him. he´s super quick to answer any questions and his place is just what it looks like in the pictures you see. the location of the apartment is very convenient, almost everything in the greater downtown area is within walking distance. patrice made my husband and i feel welcome by messaging us and giving very detailed and helpful instructions.  the loft was comfortable and my husband and i enjoyed the patio very much.  this was my first time using airbnb and overall i enjoyed the experience.  i stayed here during a business trip. patrice is a great host, and his loft was a nice place to stay - good central location, very comfortable, roomy, good wifi and workspace. patrice made sure i was comfortable and gave good recommendations about places to eat nearby. some nights got a little noisy (trash pickup, street sweeping, etc.), but that\\'s city life and part of the package. i certainly recommend this listing for business travelers (and any travelers for that matter).the apartment itself is great. the pictures are accurate, and it is very pleasant and well appointed. patrice is a great host. the location is certainly convenient. \\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately the neighborhood is really rough. the street is filthy, smells quite bad and there are a lot of dodgy characters around at all hours of the day and night. these same characters are also responsible for a lot of disquieting noise that woke me up a couple of times during my stay.\\r\\n\\r\\ni definitely did not feel safe on the street, even though i previously lived in the mission for 10 years and thought i knew what i was in for.we had a great time in patrice\\'s loft! the place is really nice, and he was very helpful and always available to answer any questions.the apartment was at a very convenient location. it\\'s right by the powell station where all the munis stop at. the apartment is also airy and comfortable. patrice is very responsive and gave us great instructions. thank you again for letting us stay!loft was as described, spacious space, clean sheets, towels and free gourmet coffee was a plus. the neighborhood is so so, homeless hanging around street corners but they tend to mind their own business and the occasional street noise. i knew this coming in as i wanted to be central to what i had to accomplish. communications with patrice and check-in was smooth. overall, i had a pleasure stay and would rent again. this is my first time to use airbnb. it is a great experience, and better than i expected. the place is good, close to my office. patrice  is a nice and helpful man.patrice was very hospitable. he made sure everything in the apartment was fine. the \\'room\\' is a semi-open space with two-person bed (comfortable!) and a separate closet + bathroom. still had a good feeling of privacy. hardly saw patrice and the airbnb room is on the 3fd floor of the apt. good location in the city, very easy to travel to silicon valley with caltrain or uber. quite some homeless around, but they aren\\'t offensive or annoying. i was there for a conference, stayed 9 nights, and left very happy and energized.the host was awesome. clear, very quick communication, immediate response, very helpful and hospitable. i felt good.\\r\\nthe neighbourhood was as described - very close to the centre & muni. i was a little surprised by number of homeless people nearby, but it turned out not to be a problem - just something to keep in mind if you\\'re coming from europe.\\r\\nthe description was good - the apartment was big & spacious, the bathroom/bed/room/closet clean and ready. make sure you understand what \"loft\" means here, it\\'s a semi open space - a little surprising at first, but turned out to be fine too.beautiful apartment with plenty of amenities. blocks away from union square, powell station, and plenty of bars & coffee shops. has a furnace for those few nights it\\'s colder than usual in sf. patrice wasn\\'t around often but pleasant to talk to when he was and helped us find some good places in the area.amazing loft that is located centrally in the heart of san francisco. patrice was away so i had the entire place to myself which was great! house was clean and host was great at communicating. one thing to highlight however is that there are a lot of homeless people around at night near the apartment which is of no fault of patrice - however they mainly kept to themselves and caused no issues. would recommend this place.my interactions with patrice were almost exclusively text and email. he has done a lot of preparation for airbnb guests and things generally went smoothly. this is a good location for someone attending a meeting at the moscone center - the convention halls are within walking distance. plan to take a cab back after dark - this is not a great area for an evening stroll.patrice was not home when i arrived and i found the instructions for finding the key unhelpful. in fact i could not find them.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is important to know that this is not a private room, but an open area to the downstairs living space. \\r\\n\\r\\nmost importantly, it is on the fourth floor of a building that does not have elevator. then there is another level. it is not recommended for people with a lot of luggage but could be fine for backpackers.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft was great, well lit, and the location of the apartment was very central - close to some great cafes and the bustling market street. expect some street noise during the nights and early morning, as it is a big city. had an amazing time at patrice\\'s apartment. we had a lot of arrival changes due to flight cancellations but he was very understanding and relaxed. the loft was big, nice, clean and super close to the city. shower, tv, wifi worked well and it had a fire place in the living area which looked pretty cool. he is a great host and i would stay there again anytime!i couldn\\'t have asked for a much better first time experience with airbnb than the one provided by patrice. \\r\\n\\r\\nvery clean, organized and most importantly welcoming home!\\r\\n\\r\\nanything and everything you may need is thoroughly explained in both email and on an information \"cheat sheet\" that can be found in your room. \\r\\n\\r\\nhardly saw patrice, as i take it he is a busy working man. but when i did see him, he reassured us that he wanted us to feel at home as much as possible. reminding us that we could freely use his kitchen, heater, balcony, etc..\\r\\n\\r\\nthis was also my first time in san francisco! walking distance from most tourist things or a $6 dollar uberpool ride away from anything! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood may seem rough due to high population of homelessness, but don\\'t let that discourage you. the most they will bug you with is asking for money. besides that they mind their own business as so should you.\\r\\n\\r\\nif i ever find myself in san francisco, i will be sure to stay with patrice again!great location, within walking distance to the heart of san francisco.  i didn\\'t want to pay $300/night to stay at the intercontinental hotel for a conference.  patrice\\'s loft is only a block away.   super convenient.  the bedroom loft is open to the main level.  a half-wall separates the room with the living area below.   patrice was a splendid host - quiet and respectful.   i would recommend this listing to any of my friends.  the location is great. there are plenty of transportation and dinning within walking distance. the loft is on 3rd floor by itself and it comes with a bathroom, so it\\'s private enough. there are some noise at night but the noise was not bad at all and i could sleep without any problem. patrice was not always at home but he was always ready to help and responded fast to my messages. my 6-day stay here was great. the host made me feel welcome. the place is very nice. close to many city sites. great coffee nearby. would highly recommend. thanks patrice,patrice was an amazing host, very friendly and easy to communicate. the apartment is as described, spacious, organized and close to the heart of san francisco. i stayed at his apartment for almost a week and had a great time there.i had a really nice stay, the bed was super comfortable, the room had exactly what i needed, and the apartment is very nice. patrice was friendly, although i barely saw him while i was there. definitely a nice spot! i totally recommend staying here.there are pros and cons of this place.   pros:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. patrice is a great host.  very responsive most of the time. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. the apartment is very spacious with lots of lights. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. the balcony/terrace was really nice. \\r\\n\\r\\n4. the espresso maker along with the coffee were great. \\r\\n\\r\\ncons:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. on a hot day, which i had encountered, the apartment gets really hot.  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. there is fan in the living room, but it is soo loud and noisy that i had to turn it off.   \\r\\n\\r\\n3. there is too much light in the apartment, which can make it difficult if you want some darkness during the day. \\r\\n\\r\\ngreat place with tons of natural light. easy host and facility\\'s were top notch. this was a nice place to stay in a great location.  it\\'s in soma but a very short walk away to union square.  patrice was barely there so it felt like you were renting the whole place.  the one thing i\\'ll say is that the room isn\\'t entirely private as it\\'s the upper floor of a loft so it looks over the living room but the walls in the room are high enough for some privacy.  overall, it was a good place to staypatrice was wonderfully warm and welcoming. he opened the door for me after i had gotten up the stairs, and nothing was a problem. an interesting character with stories from the city and his life.beautiful apartment, great central location, fantastic host: i enjoyed my stay with patrice very much - the place is great and he is an extremely likable, interesting person. we had quite a few inspiring conversations and he offered help whenever needed. \\r\\n\\r\\none thing to be aware of: the room is actually the second level of an duplex-space, so two sides are open and overlooking the living room like a balcony. i found it fun and patrice is very quiet and considerate, but you should enjoy at least occasional interaction.patrice welcomed me and was very gracious. really appreciated the hospitality and terrific apartment.i used this property as a home base in san francisco for my bridal shower weekend. in addition to myself, i hosted my mother, my matron of honor, and her two children (5 of us total). with two full bathrooms and plenty of hallway between the kids room in the front and the adult bedrooms in the back, it was very comfortable for all of us to prepare meals, get ready for events, and have a babysitter watch the kids in the living room. we even used the dining room to host a crafting event, and all of my friends were impressed with the property and the views!\\r\\n\\r\\nyogesh was very responsive to any questions i had about the property, but i didn\\'t have any problems. everything was intuitive to use, even the washer and dryer, so it very much felt like being at home. the beds are very comfortable too, which is sometimes a wild card!\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this property is a fantastic home base in san francisco--close to public transport and plenty of restaurants and shops in noe valley and the mission, but just far enough away from downtown traffic and the \"city\". and the sweeping views from the bedrooms of downtown and the bay are just incredible! you won\\'t get views like this from any hotel and it\\'s part of what will make me book this property again in the future. i highly recommend this property for a group of friends, family, or even a few colleagues looking for an alternative to hotel accommodation for a conference.the owner replied my message promptly all the time. it helped our trip a lot. \\r\\nthe check-in was easy. jamie gave us the keys and gave us the lay of the land. they even gave us a spot in their garage for our car, which was very helpful. \\r\\nthe house was quite spacious and very neat and clean. both bedrooms and bathrooms were quite roomy and very clean and well stocked. we absolutely loved the décor. i was especially impressed with the book collection, and loved the hundreds of little giraffes strewn around the house :-)\\r\\nall in all a very welcoming and comfortable place; i would go there again for sure.david and barbara provided helpful information for check-in, check-out, and the apartment contained a guide of useful information as well. a family member who lives downstairs let us in when we checked in and she was very friendly and helpful. the apartment was very nice and kept very clean. we greatly enjoyed our stay in this apartment. david and barbara were not home when we stayed, but they still made us feel at home.  their place was very clean, comfortable, and spacious -- and in a great location in the mission!  they were also flexible and let us drop our bags before check-in so that we could wander around without lugging them with us.  great communication and responsiveness as well!david and barbara weren\\'t there to greet us, but their son jamie was. jamie made us feel welcome and showed us around the house. the house was clean and accommodating; exactly as described. great location if plan on enjoying the mission neighborhood.fantastic place, fantastic location, fantastic people. apartment exactly as advertised, equipped with everything you could need and more. david and barbara were also very accommodating with check in/out which was really helpful! the bart (train) is a mere 3/4 min walk from the front door and takes you straight to union square in less than 10 mins for $1.85. valencia street has loads of great restaurants all within 5 min walk. try the crepe house around the corner for breakfast/brunch/lunch...great. oh and use uber if u need a \\'(url hidden) way cheaper and avoids the hassle of tipping! i highly recommend this place! this wasn\\'t the greatest excited experience, but the location of the apartment made up for it. close to some awesome coffee shops and yoga. the check in was less than person and the communication was poor. my boyfriend and i had to wait over an hour outside to get keys and to be let in. the room was cold and had no blinds so that was no fun in the morning. and the apartment was less than clean. all in all it worked for a quick nights sleep but i would not stay here if you\\'re looking for something cozy.the neighborhood is on the asian side of town, and it\\'s very open and inviting. the neighborhood is extremely appealing and we felt extremely safe at all times. there was a delicious burger restaurant a few blocks from ryan\\'s house. there was also an amazing thai place that\\'s opened until midnight. i really wish i could remember the name of it! the listing is a short walk/drive to the beach and no longer than 25 minutes to downtown, fishermen\\'s wharf and ghiradelli square. parking was sometimes tricky, since i had a truck, but if you have a smaller vehicle you won\\'t need to park more than a block away. the listing was just like the pictures. the room was small, but cozy enough for two people without feeling cramped. the kitchen is fully available and the bathroom was really nice and white. i enjoyed all the skylights in the house, they truly opened up all the spaces. i especially loved the backyard. after a day of driving, it was nice to sit back and relax in the sun in a backyard. ryan also came out to the backyard to chat with us every now and again, which was nice since he gave us helpful tips. we\\'d definitely stay with ryan again if we return to san francisco.the ocean view room was very good! the stay at ryan\\'s was very good. own room, and own workspace. nice view from the room, as wellwe spent 5 wonderful days in troy\\'s apartment. it\\'s on the 6th floor of a newly rebuilt old-factory building. the interieur is all new and of good fashion. the location is great. everything was easy going and we felt very welcome. clean, modern and fantastically located, troy\\'s place was just what i was looking for to spend a night in san francisco. i had a great time chatting with troy about the area.i couldn\\'t have asked for a better first airbnb experience. troy and his girlfriend were very nice and accommodating, the apartment was clean and in a great location. there were plenty of places to grab dinner close by, and it is a short walk to embarcadero which was beautiful to run down in the mornings. i would highly recommend both the hosts and the apartment.  i had a great stay at troy\\'s place. it was clean, quiet and in a great location. the balcony and roof access is a major plus. would definitely recommend staying here.the host canceled this reservation 60 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.troy\\'s apartment might be even better than what you\\'re expecting... the windows in the living room allow for a ton of natural daylight, the floors are gleaming, and the place is quite spacious with a really open floor plan. we were extremely impressed.\\n\\nadditionally, troy was willing to make last minute accommodations and was incredibly hospitable- he was quick to respond via text any questions we had even though he was stuck at work. \\nthe hot tub and view from the top floor of this location was the biggest selling point. i\\'d stay here again and again- it\\'s extremely close to the city center and walking from place to place is fantastic. if you\\'re not much for strolling from place to place, uber is another option and we used both these forms of transportation easily while in soma. (if you\\'re renting a car, parking is a little tricky but doable- just be prepared to spend a little money if you want to be parked close by.)\\nall in all, this was a wonderful air bnb experience and i would highly recommend this location.staying at troy\\'s place was great! it was clean, quiet, and very comfortable. relaxing in the hot tub on the outdoor patio after a long day exploring the city was my favorite part of the visit. the bed in the guest room is very comfortable where i slept like a rock! i\\'m a light sleeper and wake up easily but troy\\'s building and surrounding neighborhood are very quiet. the neighborhood also felt safe walking around by myself at night. this is a great location, there are so many restaurants and things to do in the area within walking distance. you really don\\'t need a car to stay in this part of town. \\n\\nthe room is exactly how it\\'s listed and troy is very hospitable. if i needed help with anything troy was easy to talk to and quick to respond via text with my questions. you won\\'t be disappointed in this space! the host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.greg is a great host! the property is beautiful and set in one of the most iconic neighborhoods of san francisco. the view on the top floor is amazing- you can see alcatraz, fisherman\\'s wharf, the golden gate bridge, and the curvy part of lombard street to boot. i felt very welcome there, and greg was excellent at communicating with me whenever i had a question regarding the rental. highly recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\n greg is an incredible host and the house is a real treasure tucked in telegraph hill.   very clean, spacious, retains the charm of san francisco, and has an out of this world view from the top floor and balcony.  also the master bedroom and kitchen were very modern and renovated which made it super comfortable.  \\n\\n\\ngreg also spent a lot of time with us recommending the best restaurants and activities for us and our kids.  \\n\\nwe would stay here again in a heartbeat!greg was a brilliant host and nothing was too much trouble. the apartment had a great view and was central to everything. greg had recommended many places of interest and this was handy. he was understanding of all of our needs and accommodations and was flexible with arrangements. he was friendly and showed genuine interest.greg was great. he had lots of suggestions on places to eat and things to do and was always available via text/phone. the flat was clean and exactly as described and pictured. awesome location, walk to everything and the views from upstairs were unbeatable. fantastic place in a brilliant location. and the views...!

annabelle was super responsive and checked in on us while we were staying there. the place is a great value and is quite large with a great common area and backyard. the place was totally set up with stocked bedrooms and showers with all amenities you would need. location was great and i would stay here ten times over. very lucky find in sf!annabelle\\'s home was exactly how she described it and more! the house was a perfect size for our family of 10. everyone had a bed and the living quarters/ backyard were spacious enough to entertain the whole group. the location was also perfection as it was 2 blocks away from bars/restaurants and the painted ladies. everything was perfect for our special trip! lastly, annabelle was so accommodating and made sure all questions were answered. the house is terrific. well maintained, beautiful rooms, and very comfortable beds.  it\\'s also very clean.  the backyard is an oasis of calm considering the flat is right in the middle of the city.  if you have a big group, it\\'s a perfect place to settle down in san francisco.  highly recommended. annabelle was wonderful. she was extremely communicative and was flexible with the check-in and check out time given the many travel schedules of those flying in to stay with me for a very special event in the city this weekend. the home was also beautiful -- spacious, many wonderful bedrooms, and the living room/kitchen + outdoor area was great to experience as well.annabelle\\'s place was nothing short of amazing! it easily accommodated our team, with plenty of space for them to gather and meet. everyone appreciated the sleeping accommodations, especially the master bedroom. \\n\\nthe location was perfect--sufficiently out of the way to offer privacy, while being close to excellent dining and coffee options. \\n\\ni would recommend this home as a great gathering place to anyone with a larger group of family, friends, or colleagues.the house was exactly like the pictures and more. we loved the house...well equipped, clean, beautifully decorated and lots of bathrooms and comfortable beds. i would not hesitate to book again. only downside (and completely unrelated to the house) was the garbage pickup outside was so loud early in the morning we thought someone was destroying the house!we travelled to san francisco for a family wedding.  we needed a large house for 3 families.  annabelle had the perfect place.  she answered all my questions very timely and we ended up renting her home.  having never been to san fran we really didn\\'t know the area.  other family was staying in hayes valley.  this house is a very good location.  we did walk to cvs but otherwise due to older parents we used lyft for all our transportation needs.  you can get anywhere in city relatively fast.  as for the (url hidden) is just beautiful.  excellent comfy beds.  we slept quite well.  the house is first two floors the top floor renters are a little loud and there is some street noise.  we travel with noise maker so not a big deal but know it could happen if you sleep on main level.  on that level you will find 3 bedrooms and a room with sleeper sofa, laundry room, and two bathrooms.  there are stairs to get into house and to get to lower level but after looking at many options this house had wider halls and less stairs then many old victorians.  on lower level you will find a great large room with twin trundle and a queen bed with attached bath, another queen room with attached bathroom, an additional bath in hall convenient to family room, a large family room, kitchen and eating area which looked out to an awesome back yard space.  we enjoyed morning coffee out there on the comfy furniture.   the house has many hairdryers and a couple irons and ironing boards.  san francisco has so many things to do.  what we found in some areas were many homeless people.  i assure you this area and house did not have that around it.   very safe area and easy walk to the painted ladies and many parks.   highly suggest ferry building, fishermans wharf, muir woods, sausalito, golden gate park, smitten ice cream, brendas soul food, and dotties cafe.  bring comfortable shoes and be prepared to work your calf muscles!   again, i highly recommend this house as annabelle is very attentive to your needs and wants to make sure you have everything you need and enjoy your stay.  thank you annabelle for a wonderful vacation and provided us with a great house that our family of 10 could enjoy.annabelle was great with communication and the entire process was seamless. the place was amazing and everyone had a great time. \\r\\n\\r\\nthank so much annabelle! casey was a very attentive host, he kept in touch to make sure we were having a great experience. i recommend this listing.casey helped make this san francisco visit possible. sad circumstances brought family and friends together and casey worked very hard to make sure that my party was comfortable and had everything they needed. casey was generous and went out of his way to accommodate us. we were emotionally frayed, and casey responded to our questions and needs with grace. we are grateful that casey made his home available to us! thank you casey!really quick respond and reply within 5 mins. love the place. easy to access to many restaurants and supermarket. had a pleasant trip with my family while staying at casey place. we have a good experience of travel.  good bedroom and living room.host din\\'t came to receive or depart us, we were on our own throughout the time.\\r\\napartment was not exactly the same as shown in the pics.\\r\\nneighborhood is fine however it was quite a walk to the glen part bart, specially wen coming back to the apartment (uphill).i was visiting on business, and i had a lot of work to do, so i needed a quiet, clean, and comfortable space to stay productive!

everything about the stay was perfect: communication, expectations--excellent experience!\\r\\nnir has a beautiful home with an amazing view of san francisco! he was very accommodating and easy to contact.me and a group of rad coworkers and friends traveled up to san fran for our sixth year to attend outside lands festival. seriously, andrea saved our butts, we\\'ve never had a hard time landing a crash/workspace in san fran until this year and not only is andrea\\'s house beautiful but it\\'s comfortable! we talked about making her an art piece for her house multiple times during the weekend we were all so thankful she helped us out in such an awesome way! i would recommend this as a first choice for any group of friends, family or folks traveling to san fran looking for an inviting, peaceful, comfortable, and beautiful place to call home. \\ngreat place in a great location with easy access to downtown via public transport!\\r\\nbrad and julie were extremely accommodating and went out of their way to make us feel welcomeperfect experience in a place better than any hotel\\r\\n\\r\\nwe stayed at vee\\'s place for 1 week and had a great experience. vee welcomed us in her house on very short notice and we were her first airbnb guests.\\r\\n\\r\\neverything was uncomplicated and easy to organize (keys etc). the room & private bathroom are as describedand very cosy and clean. we had a large (huge) tv in the room, and even had an own fridge and coffee machine and many other things such as showergel in our room/bathroom. the bed was also more than comfortable :)\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a great time in sf and would totally recommend the place! vee is a great host and we appreciated spending some time with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nit takes about 20-30 mintues to go to some central places like fisherman\\'s wharf and the place is well connected, with nearby muni stations of the n-train and buses.  \\r\\nit is in a very safe neighbourhood and the beach is just across the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you for the great time and best airbnb experience, vee :)the room is very nice. vee herself is a hospitable host, we have a decent experience living at her placeher house is located at beautiful place, near golden gate park and ocean beach. i had really great time at her place. \\r\\n\\r\\nwhat i really liked this place, fist of all, she kept my privacy as much as she could. i felt like staying hotel. i came back whenwhere i want. it\\'s very quite so i could have peaceful nights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond of all, her place is full of art sprit. she is an artist!!! you can find her amazing printings once you get there.\\r\\n\\r\\nlastly, vee is a great host. really enjoyed chat with her. she gave valuable comment about my  trip itinerary. ;) also, she got me some yogurts \\r\\nand fresh blueberry which i want for breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\ni definetly recommend her place to stay !! i really want to come back!!!everything here made our vacation  so special .\\nyour host will be more than amazing !\\nway better than staying in a hotel!\\n\\nthere will be a jacuzzi tub in the restroom if you feel like it.\\nfridge in the restroom, with drinks she even had put in for us !\\nyou\\'ll be \\nright down the street from the beach and across the street from the park.\\nwe look forward to coming back !\\nbest first time experience to san francisco !\\nour stay with vee has been most wonderful. we were able to enjoy our honeymoon and the beautiful city of san francisco. the accomodations were first class, very comfortable bed and everything was very clean and tidy. location is great too.all the reviews about how great vee and her place is are completely accurate. the entire stay was absolutely amazing! she thinks of all the best touches (complimentary mini fridge to nice bubble bath next to the jacuzzi to a vast keurig selection).  she could probably charge double for the location alone where it\\'s literally walking distance of a few blocks to the beach and one to the park.  her bed is super comfortable, plenty of storage space, and jacuzzi tub is phenom!  plus, she\\'s super awesome and chill so it makes everything really easy.  you will not be disappointed staying with vee at her airbnb!we did not met vee since she was away from the city but it was very easy to communicate with her. we had to find a new housing very quickly and she answered within minutes to our request. her daughter welcomed us and showed us around. the room is really private since you are in the back of the house and it is exactly as described and as showed in the pictures. we even had welcoming beers and ciders in the fridge! \\nthe other plus thing is the jacuzzi in the private bathroom.\\nwe were able to cook during our stay which is a plus.\\nher daughter and her boyfriend were very discrete and answered all our questions.\\ni highly recommend vee\\'s house, thanks for everything!amazing home! mark was always available and easy to contact if there were any problems. parking is quite easy seeing that its a quiet neighbor right next to the heart of castro which we loved. they have a cat names prim that was definitely one of the highlights for our group staying :) photos were accurate as to what the placed looked like, but id say that it looks better in person. we will definitely try to stay here again when we returnhello fellow airbnb users,\\r\\n\\r\\nmyself and 5 other friends from sf, seattle and houston decided to rent julia\\'s home in castro for bay to breakers weekend.  i was in constant contact with julia up until the date of check in!  of course the property/house is truly an exquisite place to be.  our group arrived saturday and we didn\\'t leave that evening because we wanted to enjoy the views!  sunday was a great success on the race course.  i would highly recommend this property to those who are looking to enjoy san francisco or for just a quiet weekend in!  \\r\\n\\r\\njulia was a pleasure to work with and it was fun to meet her and talk for a while.  her instructions were clear and it made it easier to make sure both our experiences were stellar!\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you julia for such a beautiful weekend. i hope that we can come back soon!!\\r\\n\\r\\nrebeca wadkins\\r\\nthe place was great! plenty of room, a well kept house and a great location! julia was quick to respond to any questions we had over email.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!julia\\'s house was beautiful!  great location, quiet, and close to everything.  we had a great time and would definitely recommend staying here :)  the only issue was that one of the showers was broken and the toilets were running (which we did not know ahead of time).  other than that, everything was amazing!overall great experience. there were 5 of us coming into town for the weekend - rather than staying in a hotel we thought it would be more fun, more unique to stay in a nice home where we could spend time in a relaxed way. \\r\\n\\r\\njulia and andy\\'s home was exactly what we were looking for - beautiful space, fantastic sweeping views of the city and bay (from two different decks), comfortable common areas for lounging, and a nice garden in the back. the house is on a quiet street nestled between the heart of the castro and noe valley (~10 mins walk to each). \\r\\n\\r\\nalthough andy / julia were in a different time zone, they left very clear instructions for us - so getting in and out and finding things was a breeze, and they had a local caretaker that could be reached in case of questions / issues. the house was clean, the appliances were easy to use, and for the most part things were in working order.  we also appreciated that they left recommendations on local area attractions and restaurants - it was a nice touch. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe did have a couple hiccups, for example the hot tub needed additional cleaning, however andy and julia were very responsive despite being abroad. this made all the difference! \\r\\n\\r\\nwould definitely recommend for small groups / families interested in getting off the beaten path and exploring some of sf\\'s cooler neighborhoods, or even those just looking for a relaxing place to spend a few days. julia\\'s house was perfect for our group of 5.  the house was beautiful and roomy and had amazing views of the city.  it was seamless to find it and check-in and the location can\\'t be beat.  julia was attentive and upfront (the third shower didn\\'t work and the hot tub would not be available during our stay) very early on in the process.  we would highly recommend julia\\'s house!great place, excellent view and gracious hosts! will def be returning. thx julie!our stay at julia\\'s house was wonderful.  a perfect home base in the center of town but still in an extremely quiet and convenient neighborhood with amazing views.  the house was very clean and full of everything you need.  julia was a proactive and attentive host which added to the comfort of the overall stay.  i highly recommend this house.i spent a weekend with my family and a couple of friends at julia\\'s place and we had a blast! the house is awesome, centrally located, well decorated and equipped, and has the best views in the city. we specially enjoyed the hot tub and the grill, both with breathtaking views. julia is a very nice and welcoming host. we look forward to renting this house again!extraordinary house on top of a castro hill. beautiful view, bright and spacious interior, immaculately clean - this is a must-have experience to enjoy the best sf has to offer.\\nslightly pricey but definitely worth every penny given the extraordinary experience.\\nwould definitely go back every time!our stay in san francisco was great and the home was perfect! great location, awesome view of the city, and the best beds we\\'ve ever slept in. thank you so much for having us! we would recommend this property to anyone!\\njulia was an amazing host, although we never met her while we were out there, she had everything organized and the house was clean and the hot tub was a huge plus! the neighborhood was quite and everyone was really nice! i recommend julia\\'s house to anyone that is traveling out to san francisco! this home in sf was just great, perfect for the final week of a 3 month around the world trip before flying home to australia. the views from both levels are spectacular. the bed was so comfortable. the lounge was perfect for relaxing. it was so great to arrive with everything running smoothly and the house being everything we had hoped for when we booked it. i really enjoyed my stay and i hope julia doesn\\'t move back in so we can stay next time we are in san francisco!we were a group of 3 friends from kuwait. we had a great time in sf at julia\\'s beautiful home, the home was spacious and clean and very well located.we had an excellent stay at julia\\'s beautiful home in the castro area. the hot tub was the perfect end of the evening activity and we never had any issues with neighbors even though we would use it late night. beds were comfy, house had more than basic staples (ketchup, salt, etc), clean and comfortable. things to know, third bedroom is a rollout bed (we didn\\'t use it so i can speak to comfort) and there are two sets of stairs. also, castro is a great area but it is farther out so we did pay more in uber and cab fare. overall a fantastic experience and we loved staying at this gorgeous place. lastly views are incredible!!!! julia\\'s place was great! gorgeous views, a lovely welcome basket, she was super easy to work with, even while out of the country. the neighborhood was great. quiet/residential in the few blocks around the apartment, but an easy 10-minute walk to commercial/food/retail. we took a convenient trolley to downtown every day. it\\'s a steep hill to walk up at the end of the day, but totally worth it for the views. julia is a wonderful and gracious host and her home is incredible. if you want to feel like you\\'re doing san francisco right, stay here! she gave wonderful recommendations and we felt very welcomed.julia was great great host. and the location and condition of julia\\'s home was perfact. hope to visit again!beautiful place with a gorgeous view! julia was great to work with and answered our questions quickly. incredible views of the city, great neighborhood, close to all of the necessities. i would definitely stay here again. this place really made my family\\'s trip to san francisco complete. the view and the hot tub at night was the best part - really great to come back to at the end of the day. the working fireplace was also a huge benefit. did not realize how nice that would be to have until we had it. amazing way to spend the christmas week. julia was very prompt when we had any questions, and was very kind to leave some detailed recommendations for what to do while we were in the area. great balance of location and view - hard to find in san francisco. also - parking is very very easy here. another bonus. highly recommended! from start to finish, julia was responsive, helpful, and such a gracious host.  the house itself, was amazing!  pictures just don\\'t do it justice.  great location, breath-taking views, and just the right balance of vacation and home away from home.  information provided was clear and easy to follow, which made for a relaxing and fun weekend!  i would definitely rent again.  thanks julia!this is a fantastic house. wonderful location and an amazing view of the city. we stayed for just under a week and we\\'re working most of that time, however we instantly felt at home once we walked back into the house after a long day working. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe level of decoration and furnishings here are very high standard and you can tell this is a much loved home of the owners. with 3 separate and bathrooms, this was perfect for our needs of professional sharers, that said this equally ideal for family groups as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe were here working for an event that happens every year, so good was this house that we\\'re looking to see if we can book again for next year!! \\r\\n\\r\\nbook this house with confidence, you won\\'t be disappointed ;)if you are visiting san francisco and looking for a room with a view then this is it: we stayed here for 11 nights in sept and were blown away by this beautifully designed & equipped house and above all the stunning panorama of the city skyline. waking up to it each morning was a experience and really helped to make our vacation.  the location was ideal, only a  short walk down to castro and to the muni. julia was very professional and welcoming, we particularly appreciated the detailed local guide & recommendations. i will be recommending here for sure to friends & colleagues visiting the city.  this home is extremely well designed and a beautiful, unique and wonderful spot.  the listing description is accurate!    the rear garden is private and lushly landscaped with plenty of seating.  it is truly a great home.   you will enjoy privacy and quiet and yet be close to restaurants and stores.    we felt lucky to have the chance to stay there.\\r\\n  the home has high ceilings, oak flooring, and is light and airy.  the views of the san francisco skyline are spectacular -- they are not exaggerating!    of note, the three bedrooms are grade separated for privacy and each has a bathroom.  (one has just a crib in it.) we used uber (probably should have tried lyft) so we can\\'t speak to public transport.  the host\\'s recommendations for restaurants were excellent.  the neighborhood (castro/noe valley) is charming and walkable (a little hilly but that is sf)    the hostess will promptly answer any questions you have even when she is traveling in europe!this was my first experience with airbnb and truthfully, i didn\\'t know what to expect. were the photos accurate? was the description true? yes! and yes! julia\\'s home is beautiful, comfortable, and the view is the best in the city!! unbelievable sunsets from the master bedroom. my husband, son and i were there because we had a family member in the hospital at ucsf-parnassus and the location couldn\\'t have been better-just a 5 minute uber ride. after a long stressful day, it was so nice to be able to relax in a home that felt like home. julia\\'s welcome kit included instructions, restaurant recommendations, and a bottle of wine. thank you, julia!\\r\\n  paul was very welcoming and easy to communicate with.  checking in and out of the house was a breeze. the view from the upper deck was even more spectacular than pictured! this penthouse is worth every penny.  it was immaculately clean and truly felt like we were staying in a private five star hotel with friends. all of us had a great stay in san francisco’s nob hill. we were walking distance from a fully stocked local grocery store, the beautiful views at top of the mark, parking garages, and cabbies. we would definitely rent from paul again and spend another great getaway in style in nob hill.\\r\\nit was an absolute pleasure working with paul and micky.  they were extremely helpful and accommodating. the space was spectacular and the pictures really don\\'t do it justice. finishes and technology were outstanding. the neighborhood is quiet and very centrally located. great coffee shops and breakfast places near by. definitely one of the best places you can rent in sf.communication - 10 out of 10\\r\\ncleanliness - 9 out of 10\\r\\namenities - 8 out of 10\\r\\nlocation - 9 out of 10\\r\\naccuracy of description - 9 out of 10\\r\\n\\r\\noverall a great place to stay. wonderful decor. very flexible and accommodating with our situation. the place was stunning and quite comfortable. honestly, the best place i\\'ve ever found on airbnb.paul was extremely responsive via email, despite being out of town when i contacted him. he pulled some strings to fit us into his townhouse, which as you may have guessed, is in high demand. the place is immaculate and stunning.  looks modest from the outside, but jaw dropping inside, feels brand new.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom the upstairs balcony, we prolly had the best view in the city, 2nd to coit tower, but that\\'s a monument (may not be a fair comparison). lol. there is a firepit, heat lamps, and barbecue pit on that balcony/patio. warning: it will be hard for you to leave the house to see the rest of the city once you\\'re inside this place.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere\\'s a small convenience store nearby, fairmont hotel is a block away, neighborhood is extremely tranquil.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly con is the no parking, but there are parking garages nearby. we got rid of our rental car after we checked in with our luggage and uber\\'ed thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nplace is so great, i would be thrilled to stay here every chance i come to sf.paul and micky were a pleasure to work with!  paul was very quick to respond to emails and both were very flexible with check in and check out times which allowed us to make the most of our time in san francisco!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood was quiet and very centrally located.  the apartment was extremely clean, very bright, large and comfortable and even more beautiful than the pictures show (like something straight out of houzz!)  the top deck and view are fantastic and we wish we had more time to enjoy this special \"bonus.\"  \\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely stay here again for future trips to san francisco!  \\r\\nthis place is such an amazing house full of warm memories of the hosts. my family called it the \"family museum\". everything functioned very well, and we truly enjoyed the stay. it\\'s very easy to drive or take a uber to downtown san fran, love the place!our hosts were extremely nice throughout our stay. they were very accommodating since we got delayed at the airport and reached really late. \\r\\nwe had a great time at louise and jim\\'s place. their house is really nice and has a cozy feeling. lots of books to read. it was exactly what i expected from the listing. also has a great location. we had a car and the commute to downtown/airport was pretty short. the neighborhood was nice and quiet. loved the fact that the area is full of small hills which san fran is famous for.we had a great stay at jim and louise\\'s. the house was as described, with plenty of space for a family of 5. the place is charming and personal, with a literary vibe.\\nclose to bart, and with a great field/playground across the the street.\\njim and louise were friendly and courteous, and provided us with a wealth of useful information prior to arrival.\\nwe will definitely recommend this place to fellow travellers, and families with children in particular. having a car is recommended, as grocery stores are a bit awayjim and louise were the perfect host! they provided a good tour of the house, they have clearly documented rules and the location was perfect. great location , not far from the action on waikiki beach. the bungalow has all you need. definitely value for money.great place and hosts,  exactly as on pictures and you have a full equiped kitchen, lots of space, 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and all clean. nothing missing. neighbour is nice, had a great dinner  at a nice italian close by. the bart and muni metro and bus are very close. very close to the airport as well. \\r\\nthis house is incredible. the hosts are avid readers so there’s a lot of books everywhere. they are also very creative so you’ll find interesting things here and there. the place is actually bigger than we expected, 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, big living room, tv room and also tv in the master bedroom.  there’s a nice backyard with lots of native plants and flowers. the kitchen had everything we needed to make our own meals. there’s even a piano. we wished we would have stayed here longer.\\r\\nlouise and jim are very organized and provide a lot of good information. do not forget to read the guide book that they have for you in the kitchen. there’s information on metro station and fares, bus routes and fares, places to eat, hospitals, you name it they answered all our questions and were readily available to help with little things like recommending a nearby restaurant or calling a cab. \\r\\nthe neighborhood is very nice and it feels safe. we park our car outside and there wasn’t any issues with that. the metro is 5 blocks away so it’s perfect for those days when you don’t want to bother with parking. around the metro station, there is a big supermarket with lots of healthy stuff. \\r\\nthree friends visiting san francisco stayed at jim and louise\\'s house. we each had a private bedroom and a bathroom to use. the internet/wifi worked well and the tvs are modern with a good selection of channels.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts are easy to communicate with, the house is in great shape and clean. i\\'ll definitely see if this location is available if i return to san fran.our family had a wonderful time at this house. it managed to give 3 couples (and kids) our own spaces and bathrooms with room to spare. it felt very cozy - full of the hosts family photos, books, and memories. the tv\\'s were modern with great cable service and the wifi was great, too. the kitchen had every appliance you could think of. louise was very gracious and sweet in our walk through and jim (and penny) seemed very nice, as well. two parking spot was a great perk of this location. downtown and the airport are not very far and it was easy to navigate - so is a grocery store and coffee shop. we absolutely made ourselves comfortable and had a great time!we enjoyed staying at louise and jim nayer/patten\\'s home in san francisco.  louise and i texted back and forth before our arrival to arrange meeting and getting the keys.  upon our arrival at their home, louise showed us around their home.  she was very kind to leave us a bottle of wine, some fresh fruit, coffee, and milk.  my husband, my mother in law and myself stayed for four nights.  the house was very comfortable.  the home is in a nice, quiet neighborhood of san francisco, glen park.  we would recommend staying with louise and jim!louise and jim have a great/quaint place in the south part of san francisco. near shops and a bart station, it has a great location with easy access to the highway also. the off-street parking is a huge plus and the number of available bedrooms/bathrooms is great for groups. you are definitely staying in their home and to see the amount of history and love of the family that lives here provides a good comfortable environment. i did not get to meet louise and jim personally but they were very easy to communicate with and the entire process was smooth/efficient. they even left us a bottle of wine and some snacks!a extended family from beijing, china spent three days in louis and jim\\'s house. \\n\\nthe location was perfect, especially with the roadside parking place. very convenient!\\n\\nthree bed rooms and individual bath rooms fit to my extended family very well.\\n\\nmy family enjoyed the lovely house. we like the design very much, and the beautiful poems on the wall. we had a great time at louise and jim\\'s home. they are incredibly nice and overly accommodating. thank you for a wonderful time.very nice apartment, we had a lot of space and there are detailed instructions for everything. louise and jim are always fast at responding our questions, and made us feel very welcomed. loved the neighborhood and its views, easy to get around in sf from there too! jim, welcomed us when we got there and gave us a tour around the house and handed us a bottle of wine on the way out. the house was perfect for what we needed. plenty of space for three couples and a separate bathroom for all of us. the parking was a huge plus and across the street there were some hiking trails we were able to take advantage of. louise and jim were very responsive whenever we had a question. we had a great time in sf. hopefully, we can come back again soon. louise and jim were very proactive and easy to deal with.  they made coordinating the stay in their home simple, which was great.  as other reviewers have noted, you are very much staying in their home but they do make it simple to slip in and make it your own during your stay. the neighborhood is convenient to many things.  their street is louder than we expected but the bedrooms are in the back of the house so it doesn\\'t end up being a problem.in one word? disappointment!\\n\\n we recommend to verify the condition of the house and the host\\'s fairness. \\n\\nwe were 2 families with one teenager each traveling together. our contact with the host began very promising: good communication,apparently the house and the host met all our expectations. the check and check out were nice and pleasant. the problems began when we discovered after a few days of journey that the washing machine, the the dryer are not functioning properly. we had a conversation with the host about that. but since the host was so nice, we decided not to make a big story and to  make the laundry in the neighborhood. it was very disturbing , but  after all, we came to san francisco  to make fun and not to deal with house keeping. the general condition of the house was not good, but we decided after a discursion  not to place any opinion about the house and leave to following guests to judge the house condition themselves. we also assumed that it happens that a house needs some improvement, and the hosts are aware about that. but unfortunately after we left, the host decided to improve the house condition beginning with the dryer on at our  expenses . we feel very sorry about the outcome and call  other guests not to use the house until  all the problems will be addressed..jim greeted us warmly and showed us the house and answered all questions and left us both his and louise\\'s phone number should we have any issues while there.  we had none, so we had no more contact with them these rest of our stay (6 nights).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was great!  close to public transportation (just across street for buses and all of muni; just 1/3 mile from bart).  it is less than a two mile walk/hike to twin peaks, which 3 of us did one evening and were rewarded with a great sunset.  also just across the street from glen canyon park, a hidden gem in the city i recommend for anyone visiting sf, as it has great trails, views and wildlife - we saw owls and a coyote.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe 3 br, 3 bath was great for our party of 5 with the public areas in the front so use of these in the morning did not awaken anyone sleeping in.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are 2 high quality tv\\'s with extensive channel selection; one in the family room and one in the master br.  the one in the master br also has netfix movies available.\\r\\n\\r\\nall beds were firm (we did not use pull out sofa bed; it may not have been as firm).  the bed in the master bedroom was the firmest bed i have ever experienced, which was ok with me, but uncomfortable for my wife, who a couple nights ended up sleeping on the sofa for a few hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is dated both inside and out, and houses are attached to each other in this area of town.  at times we could hear conversations of neighbors through the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere was basic cleanliness - floors, kitchen counters, bathroom facilities.  however, there could have been more attention to detail such as cleaning of the oven and outside of shower area and some soap scum on glass of shower walls.  also, pots and pans were worn.\\r\\n\\r\\nin our group two of us would come back to this house again if vacationing again in sf; three would not.  i think much has to do with expectations with the dating of the house.  also, the extreme firmness of the master bed was cause enough for one to not come back.\\r\\n\\r\\ni am giving 4 stars because i think the size and location make this a great place for parties of 5-6 people, and if not colored by dating of house (which i think should be expected), the primary thing keeping this house from a 5 star rating is the attention to detail with cleanliness.a wonderful place to stay. we were seven persons staying for 3 nights and this was our first try with airbnb. everything went even better than expected. communication with louise was easy and fast before and while our stay. the house really is as in pics - simply charming and the location is great. just 10 mins to downtown by bart or bus and still in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. when arriving we felt really welcome. louise was there for us to show the house and she was a kind of person we liked  right away. the complimentary coffee, milk, cookies, fruits and wine she had for us was a nice surprise. we highly recommend this place.the host was there to greet us, provide the information booklet, and fill us in on some details.  the welcoming snacks and coffee were appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe glen park neighborhood is convenient and friendly.louise and jim were extremely friendly and easy to get a hold of and talk to. the whole experience was very positive and i would highly recommend staying at their lovely home. their place was spacious and convenient to the bart. we all had a wonderful time!

when she greeted us and walked us through the home, we almost felt like we\\'d made a friend and wanted her to stay and hang out! she was so helpful in showing us where things were and making sure we had everything we needed. great communication leading up, and throughout the our stay. to top off the experience, the hosts bought us champagne and wine to welcome us, knowing we were a bridal party!!

 my husband and i traveled up for a very quick trip to san francisco.  i have never rented from airbnb before, and i can\\'t imagine that any future travel will ever match the wonderful experience that we had at margie and bill\\'s home.  i was a little uncertain about staying in a home with the owner\\'s on the premises, but my husband and i could not have been more comfortable.  the home is stunning!  our master suite (larger than most sf hotel rooms), large outdoor patio, closet, private en-suite bathroom, large flatscreen tv and surround sound were only some of the comforts that margie\\'s home provides.  the bed, linens and pillows were heavenly.  provided in the bathroom were all of the amenities that you could need for - including large plush bath sheets and towels.  access to the rooftop deck was absolutely another delight...360 views of the city.  margie provided us with evening beverages prior to us heading out into town, only to be followed up the next morning with lattes and a delicious breakfast.  i would be remiss not to mention murphy, their sweet and handsome kitty.  and lastly, their home was spotless.  my husband and i would travel back to sf in a heartbeat not only to stay with margie and bill, but also just to visit with them.  thanks to margie, bill and murphy!!\\r\\nabsolutely gorgeous space!

we certainly didn\\'t expect such hospitality! easy to find and access. we took margie\\'s recommendation for parking and everything went off without a hitch :o) thanks again for a wonderful stay!i had a great 4 night experience staying with margie and bill. i arrived late from the east coast and margie made sure to come down and greet me (even though i\\'m sure i woke her up!) this was just the beginning of how accommodating margie is to her guests. she has thought of \"all the little things\" and made sure to make her guests feel welcome and comfortable. her place is beautiful and bed/linens/coffee/toiletries are all top notch. i feel the price is a great value compared to staying in a hotel and i highly recommend staying here!  margie was hands down the best airbnb host i have experienced. very warm and welcoming. she made me feel right at home and offered many tips to make me feel like a local.  beautiful home and superb room. super comfy bed and every amenity imaginable. i felt like i was staying at the four seasons, no kidding!  number keypads made logistics very easy (eliminating key transfers).    i will definitely be back. highly recommended! this was my first airbnb experience and doubt i\\'d have one in the future that tops this. the room (and entire house) is beyond beautiful. margie has thought of every single detail possible. why stay anywhere else when you can have this type of experience? i\\'ll be sure to stay here the next time i\\'m in san francisco. no where else.we stayed at her apartment as the last two nights of our one week holiday, and we could not have chosen a better place. margie was lovely, and she accommodated our every needs while respecting our privacy. she made us a gourmet breakfast each morning. it felt like we were staying in a five star hotel! \\r\\n\\r\\nhe apartment is like a designer\\'s model home; excellent taste of furnitures, paintings and ornaments. her guest room is probably one of the best guest room you can ever stay at. everything about it was a top-notch and you just need to experience yourself. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe would love to stay at her apartment again. thank you so much, margie! x \\r\\nboth margie and her husband went above and beyond to ensure that we had a relaxing and enjoyable stay. the accommodations were even better than they appeared in pictures believe it or not. there are blackout shades that come down with the switch of a button and the king size bed gave me one of the best night sleeps i’ve had in a long time. in the morning, margie had a wonderful breakfast complete with fruit and lattes ready for us. margie’s welcoming and kind personality made us feel right at home. we are going back! awesome home and a super easy walk over to moscone.  margie and bill were great!  the suite had everything i needed and more, chocolates, bottled water, and even a tooth brush which came in very helpful since i left mine at home.   margie even prepared breakfast for me every morning.  what a treat.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend margie\\'s place!!!this is a beautiful place with an exceptional host.  margie has created an oasis in the city that includes very comfortable furnishings, really great breakfasts, and a modern pleasing aesthetic.  margie and bill are both welcoming and kind, and we had good conversations.  they also had excellent suggestions for things to see and do in the area.  margie really cares and  has thought of everything that makes for a great place to stay.  i very much enjoyed my stay here, and highly recommend. very welcoming and quick to respond! we were in need of a place within a few hours or arriving of san francisco and margie was very quick to respond and accommodate our situation. we arrived and she gave us a tour of the place, and it was absolutely fantastic. she offered to make us breakfast in the morning but we had to leave quite early to get a bit more touring in. the house was very quiet and so was the neighborhood. outside was just a wee-bit sketchy, but i don\\'t think there was anything to worry about. it was very close to a lot of businesses and food within a 3 minute walk. you\\'d love staying here!

the water pressure was great and the bathrooms were large, but the water heater could not quite keep up with 9 showers in a row (understandably), so just be mindful. once we got the hang of it, we had no issues.we stayed at judy\\'s place near alamo square while attending a week long conference.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is very nice, just far enough from downtown to be relax yet close enough not to stress about getting where you need to be in the morning during traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe were treated by the bay to breakers run on sunday morning...wow what a first san francisco morning experience!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was very clean, very cosy, well appointed with all the living basics.  parking can be tricky, but street parking is available and we were able to keep our full size suv for the week without issues, however a smaller car is strongly recommended.  we wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay there again.\\r\\n\\r\\nas for judy, we couldn\\'t asked for a better host.  she is great.  thanks for letting us stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe boysjudy is a great host.  she was on top of everything and met us exactly when we agreed to meet.  she provided great recommendations of things to do in the area.\\n\\nthe house itself is in a fantastic location.  it\\'s within walking distance of many restaurants and bars.  we definitely did not lack choices.  the bedrooms were sizeable, especially for san francisco.  i would definitely stay here again when i\\'m in the area.judy was extremely attentive and helpful. she told us about great spots to dine at in the neighborhood and made us feel very welcome. the space is very large and spacious, great beds and good sunlight! my colleagues and i definitely enjoyed our stay in judy\\'s enormous and grand residence. the surrounding neighbourhood is beautiful, the nearby park was great, and it was very closely located to great bars, restaurants, and groceries. check-in  and out was effortless, can\\'t complain at all.i booked judy\\'s 4 bedroom flat for our company\\'s recent trip to san francisco. the house was perfect for this occasion - we were two girls and two guys, and the layout allotted for each of us to have our own private \"wing\" of the house including a bathroom. the rooms are huge, the beds are all comfortable and the kitchen is perfect if you like to cook! unfortunately, we were out of the house most of the time at the office and at our event in town, but it was very beautiful. the local restaurants are also lovely, and add to the charm of the neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\njudy\\'s place is very much recommended, and we hope to be able to stay here again in the future!good communication with owner, great neighborhood. place is large, beds are variable in terms of comfort and minimal decor inside. if you are looking for a place to unwind and spend a lot of time relaxing, this may not be your place, but if you want a great jumping off point in a great neighborhood for a decent price, give this place a look.the house is in a great central location that is very quiet.  the rooms were clean and well furnished.  they are also bigger than they appear in the photographs.  the rooms were well appointed and judy is very responsive and accomodative.  it was a very positive experience.  this was my first airbnb experience. worked great! would definitely stay here again. awesome host!stayed here for 4 nights. it was a great neighborhood and judy was very kind and helpful. a pleasure. we reserved this place for friends visiting us in san francisco. they had a wonderful time enjoying a true feel for the city. this place is gorgeous, extremely well located. the host was very professional and quick to answer any questions. i would highly recommend this place for your stay in san francisco!the place was great. excellent location and surprisingly easy to find parking. me and my friends were attending a conference so we didn\\'t get to spend much time at judy\\'s place but she was quick to respond and really helpful. great first experience with airbnb. i rented the upstairs apartment apartment for my team while we were in town for a race the following day. the owner, judy was very courteous and easy to get ahold of. i met her when i checked in, and she was very nice. the apartment was very spacious, there were toiletries available for us to use. the check in and out instructions were very clear. the teams only complaint was a couple of the beds weren\\'t so comfortable, one mattress was very hard and another one quite squeaky. the floor also needed a little sweeping, it was a little dirty. but for what we needed, a place to sleep after a long drive from los angeles before an early morning race, it was perfect. i\\'d recommend judy\\'s home to anyone with a decent group who needs to stay in the city.this was my first airbnb experience and i must say it went as well as could be hoped for. for a group of 10 people, judy had everything we could have possibly needed ready for us. the flat is absolutely beautiful, with plenty of space. the location was also ideal for us, as we were easily able to find street parking for the 4 cars we had. judy was also great during the process leading up to my stay, as she answered all my questions promptly and stayed in communication with me up to and during my stay. i can not recommend her and this flat enough! it\\'s my first time use airbnb, and judy\\'s really friendly and helpful, i\\'ll definitely stay again if come to sfo next time. we had a wonderful time there :)we were a group of business colleagues travelling to sf for a conference at the moscone centre. judy\\'s house was simply perfect! beautiful, clean, welcoming and easily enough space for everyone.\\r\\ngreat, safe location but still easy to get into moscone centre.\\r\\njudy was a fantastic and gracious host and made my job of organising everyone super easy. \\r\\nthe feedback from the team is that they never want to stay in a hotel again!\\r\\njudy was great welcoming us and providing us with everything we needed! the property is just as listed and is great for bigger groups staying in sf. the location is central and there are many bars/restaurants/shops right at the doorstep.the location was great.  communication with judy was quick and easy.  the listing was accurate but note that the wifi costs extra so we used our own hotspot.  parking was a challenge.  as a group of four adults and a 10 year old boy it was a comfortable size.  judy was responsive to quickly resolve a small kitchen problem that arose.  i recommend alamo square, it\\'s cool restaurants, and judy\\'s place.i got married in san francisco, and ahead of my wedding, my aunts and uncles wanted to stay in a home together to catch up with one another as such occasions are rare.  that\\'s because most of them live in different countries:  india, italy, ireland, the uk, and canada!\\r\\n\\r\\njudy\\'s home was an excellent place for them to spend time with one another as well as a central location from which they could visit restaurants, buy groceries, and tour the city.judy was very accommodating to our needs. i felt at home as soon as i walked into the place. the house was vey clean, bright, and had plenty of space. the location was prime as well. the only thing that was missing was a television, but who wants to sit and watch tv while on vacation anyway. i would totally recommend this place to anyone visiting the san francisco area!judy\\'s home was very clean and nice overall. we had 4 guys who were travelling to san francisco on business for two days of meetings stay in the house and we all were very impressed. the check in and check out were both a quick and easy process. the house was very clean, welcoming, and in a very good location.this is first of all, one of the most beautiful homes you will be able to find. its location is magnificent and the home is luxurious.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is walking distance to alamo park which has a gorgeous view of sf. and within 10minutes you are inside of downtown sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe best host ever! she is so helpful and wants to make sure everyone is having a good time.great apartment, spacious and clean. we loved the neighborhood and alamo sq. \\r\\n\\r\\njulie was very friendly and responsive.our host provided clear instructions about her house so we knew how to get there and how to get in, and what the neighborhood was like.\\r\\nthe layout was just right for our large group of 9 adults and one infant.\\r\\nthe space was large so we didn\\'t get in each other\\'s way, and having a central kitchen/living area with table to meet was nice. we didn\\'t mind  that sheets and towels were not luxurious, washing machine and dryer right in the house to do laundry anytime was handy.  the long flight of stairs to the 2nd floor of this duplex unit might not suit everyone, but even our great-grandma did ok.  \\r\\nvery basic supplies in the kitchen, would have liked one roll of paper towels to handle immediate cleaning needs.\\r\\nwe followed our host\\'s recommendation of a restaurant in the neighborhood and really enjoyed it.  very convenient and lovely neighborhood in sfo. in good weather, the back patio would have been enjoyable.  parking during non-holiday times might be a bit hard, but we did fine over thanksgiving weekend.  would definitely recommend to anyone who needs to house a large group comfortably but economically in this expensive city.judy was great and friendly. everything was as she said it would be. house was very spacious. all rooms are private and clean. parking can be a nightmare but it\\'s worth the extra effort for the location. spacious and clean accomodation! easy to find, nice location; all perfect, thanks a lot.\\r\\njudy was very fast in her communication, the check in/out process was easy and straight forward, good description via email. judy was awesome! i really felt welcomed in her home and her city. the house is located in a great spot with coffee shops and the best pizza just around the corner ;)! as airbnb employees, it was a strange experience.\\r\\nwhen we arrived we knew she lived on the first floor, but we just saw her once and it was just a coincidence. she asked us, why she was not a superhost.\\r\\n\\r\\nwell, the house is full of notes where she tells you to be careful with use of water as per sf law, to turn off the heater before leaving, to take your shoes off and more... everywhere in the house you find this notes and more than once in different rooms. very cold welcoming and turned us off to be honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere was absolutely nothing in the fridge or the kitchen. to be a superhost is really needed to make sure there is at least the basics.\\r\\nwhen i asked her for extra toilet paper, she told me that she had 1 for each toilet, but that if we needed more we will need to go to the store to get it (another basic lacking). \\r\\n\\r\\nanother strange thing is that she asked us to water her plants.. well.. we really didnt feel welcome, any of us, and was pretty obvious why she was not a superhost.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe backyard is not possible to use, as the full window of her bedroom is just there.. we didnt feel confortable going there.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe didnt feel at home.\\r\\nthe listing description was accurate and quite comfortable.  plenty of space to spread out and enough room for 4 business travelers.  the neighborhood was nice and there is a great coffee shop just a few doors down.  judy was a great host and very responsive to all communication. my coworkers loved their stay :) description was pretty accurate. arrival and checkout very easy. parking situation is not too bad. host provides instructions on that. location is very convenient.  i rented judy\\'s apartment, for a large group of family/friends visiting from out of town.  the apartment was huge and spacious, and in a great location for food and nightlife, but still very quiet.  although, we never met or spoke, judy was great in her communication, and was fast to respond with my questions and requests.  \\r\\nthis property was beautiful inside and out. the neighborhood was great and we had easy access to everywhere in the city.\\r\\n    however it was not well maintained and stocked. we had 12 people staying. i paid extra per person and i assumed that house would be stocked to accommodate our group. one if the beds, intended to sleep two, was an air mattress which was disappointing. then we found out in the night it leaked and had to repeatedly fill it. there was only toilet paper on the rolls and none stored. so we were told to go buy more.  there were not enough towels for twelve people to shower, so we had to share and do laundry everyday.  there also weren\\'t garbage bags, hot pads, a handle on the microwave, and various other things. \\r\\n   we were not at the house most if the time and only cooked one meal there.\\r\\n   i admit we were a bit loud coming home at night so i apologize for that.\\r\\n   this house was beautiful and sunny, and if more effort was put into stocking it i would stay there again. but i don\\'t want to be washing towels and going to the store for tp on vacation.this home was very nice and clean, just as pictured.  the location makes it easy to get just about anywhere in the city.  the host, judy, was very responsive and made sure everything went smoothly.  thanks!judy made us feel welcome.  she happened to be outside the apartment, returning from walking her dog when we arrived.  she was very friendly. she offered to help us with restaurant ideas in the neighborhood.    \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is spotless. it actually looks even better in person in comparison to the pictures online.   so clean!!!  the beds are very comfortable. good bedding and linens.  it is very quiet at night. \\r\\n\\r\\nparking in the neighborhood is a hassle so if you have a car, plan ahead.  our car got broken into while parked in the parking lot on mcallister and scott so i wouldn\\'t recommend that lot.  it\\'s not well lit.     \\r\\n\\r\\nshe does expect you to start your used linens in the wash and to take out the trash when you check out.  the washing machine is in the unit so it\\'s easy to do.  the trash is right outside the building, so again, easy to do.   \\r\\n\\r\\nshe had a bunch of frozen chickens in the freezer.  i wasn\\'t sure if they were for the guests or not.    \\r\\n\\r\\nlots of great eatery\\'s within walking distance. the mill bakery, tartine, nopa, bi-rite ice cream. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall, i think judy\\'s place is a great option. i\\'d stay there again.  we had a great weekend at alamo square. it is in a great location, walking distance to shops, restaurants and bars and set up well for a big group. judy is a gracious and well-organized host. she was quickly available by message both before and during the weekend for anything we needed.great location. easy check-in and out. the flat is clean and comfortable. we loved it.everything is perfect except suitable for family travelthe place is great! as nice as the pictures show. right around the corner from the mill, nopa, bi-rite, and other good stuff. judy was helpful and responsive during my stay. beautiful home in a beautiful location. the bedrooms were larger and more spacious than in the pictures. the home was extremely clean when we arrived and we immediately felt at home. very attentive host as she replaced the laundry detergent within the hour when we ran low. highly recommended experience.  hello! the house was beautiful, exactly like the photos, we were in a charming aera! but one room was noisy because of the street and in 2 rooms there was creaking beds! globally it was a really good expérience!judy\\'s house is very clean and in a quiet place.  we, 3 families, have a good time in the house.  judy is very kind to show me the house.  parking on the street is no problem.nice place and nice welcome, thanks judywe had a great stay at judy’s place in alamo square. what a great neighborhood, and very easy to communicate with throughout our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks judy!judy made everything very easy for our group. check-in was easy and she answered all of our questions quickly. there was plenty of space and the apartment was clean and in a good location. it’s a nightmare to live in judy’s house. \\r\\nfirstly, before we check in, we just asked judy if 3 extra people were permitted to live, when she denied, we confirmed in written that the 3 extra people will live in other hotel rather than live in her house. however, she ordered us to provide the evidence to prove the 3 extra people live in other hotel, or she will cancel our reservation. her requirement is very rude and unreasonable, because it violets other people and other hotel’s rights of privacy.\\r\\nsecondly, after we check in, our car window was smashed only because there are too many luggages to move in and we had to split the luggage to move in for two times, when we came out to move the luggage on the second time, our car window was smashed. we had to call the police and change our car with the car rental company. judy didn’t tell us the safety environment is so bad around her house, if we know that, we would never rent her house.\\r\\nthirdly, there are not enough quilt and blanket for us, so that two of our people caught a cold.\\r\\nfinally, when we check out and leave the house, she told us that her deposal was leaking water and asked us to pay 775usd for her. we used all properties carefully and cleaned the house when we check out, and there is no property is broken when we check out. i don’t know why she complains us and ask us to pay such high amount of money.\\r\\nthe whole experience is a nightmare!\\r\\njudy was a great host, the apartment was as advertised and we really enjoyed your stay. we will definitely be staying here again on our next visit to san francisco.the location and space are great, with plenty of room for a family or group, including for meals around the large lr/dr table.  the only-for-rentals flat is airy and light, with a nice classic feel, and assorted furnishings.  our communications with manager judy were extensive, as there is legitimate concern that guests could abuse the space with extra/unpaid for guests.  as in most of san francisco, parking can be a challenge; that\\'s just the way it is.  judy greeted us as planned and made us feel welcome.judy was very friendly in person. quick with her responses when you had questions. the house was beautiful and very spacious. judy was greatjudy was a fantastic host, always available.\\r\\n... and the location was amazing, beautiful neighbourhood with lotsa cool places to eat.\\r\\nand most importantly, judy\\'s place was beautiful, very comfortable.the host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we were able to easily get into the house via the instructions that judy provided us with, and the house was exactly how it was listed. we had a great time at the house and the neighborhood was as expected. judy was also quick to respond to any questions that i asked of her. i would definitely recommend the house to anyone interested. judy\\'s place was a pleasure to stay in during our business trip to sf. she does an outstanding job of communicating with us.everything with this listing was as we had expected. we appreciated the level of detail provided for check-in and check-out, it seems like a small thing, but it makes both processes so much easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was excellent - our group found it easy to access many parts of the city from this listing. i stayed with some co-workers and their families in judy\\'s accommodation and we loved it! our stay was more than great - we had everything we needed. the neighborhood is very nice and quite; the alamo square is just next door with a beautiful view on the city. also the golden gate park is in walking distance. we highly recommend this place; we stayed here for business and could rest appropriately!!i stayed for business with my colleagues at judy\\'s apartment and it was a wonderful stay!! we really enjoyed the apartment with all facilities as well as the location with the alamo square next door and plenty of restaurants & bars. judy was a great host giving us good recommendations and help if needed. hope to stay in this apartment again!everything was clean, comfortable, and the listing was accurate! recommended!our family stayed here for thanksgiving. we live a few blocks away but lack the space to accommodate everyone. the house is very spacious. it was great the 8 people, multi generations. everyone slept soundly and enjoyed some time visiting with each other in the house and back yard. walking distance to alamo square, we were able to grab something warm to drink and all take photos on the top of the hill over looking the cityscape and the famous painted ladies. thank you judy for hosting.  my company stayed here for a conference and everything went quite well.  it was conveniently located to where they needed to be and it was spacious for all 5 of them.  the host was great, thorough and understanding about our arrival times.  it was very convenient not to have to bring towels, sheets, and various toiletries!  we would stay here again!judy\\'s place is in a good spot just around the corner from the painted ladies and close to a number of restaurants. there\\'s a great little diner a few doors down for breakfast. the apartment itself is very spacious and is quite basic. there is no lounge room or tv. the lack of tv didn\\'t bother us but the small 2 seater couch was a little lacking when the 6 of us were all in the living area. we had a couple of small hiccups with a broken microwave and a leaking ceiling in one of the bedrooms but they were not big issues. the biggest inconvenience for us was the parking. street parking is capped at 2 hours maximum during the day up until 8pm so moving the car was a hassle. we also got a fine for not turning our wheels to the curb - something we were unaware we needed to do. (isn\\'t that what a park break is for?). the front bedroom on the street also gets a little noisy at night. on a whole a good stay though and judy very kindly provided us with a late checkout the day we were leaving.wow, what an excellent experience we had this past week at judy\\'s place. there were five of us in total for a conference at the moscone center, and we found the home comfortable, spacious, and just right. judy was easy to communicate with and fast to respond. i highly recommend staying here!the apartment was great and judy was very responsive as a host. would highly recommend. this apartment is beautiful! it was great for a big group like ours - it\\'s so spacious. it was great there that were some light snacks / tea also. we would definitely stay here again!the host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.very nice appartment and very good location. judy answered all questions very quickly and the way of key handover is very smart. in a group of eigth guys we enjoyed our stay in sf.the host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.great location, loved the local coffee, the sunday morning farmers market and eateries nearby on divisadero st all within 1-2 blocks walk.  the best thing about this flat is the size, very long with good size bedrooms.  and, if you have a snorer in your group, using one end of the house for that person with plenty of doors to close in between solves the problem ;-).\\n\\nwe had to visit several parts of town over the weekend including the haight, the deep mission/potrero hill area, lands end and union square.  everything was closer than expected by car and i found the drives to be quick and direct.  \\n\\nthe weather in this part of town is sunny for the most part.  i have been on divisadero st for coffee for almost 30 years and rarely is there fog in the mornings.  late afternoons and evening can be cool and fog will roll in sometimes, but, for the most part judy\\'s flat is outside of the fog line.\\n\\nthanks judywe loved judy\\'s place! nice and spacious in a great part of town!the host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.simone\\'s home is incredible, it\\'s truly a san francisco treasure. it\\'s clear much love and care has gone into the decoration and upkeep of this masterpiece property. id highly recommend.great host, house, and location.  she was abel to get us in at the last minute and was very accommodating.  highly recommended for anyone with a group or on a business trip.i had a great stay at patrick\\'s place.  it was clean, spacious, and looked exactly as advertised.  it has a great location, right near union square, with plenty in the area to keep me entertained.  it was exceedingly easy working with patrick for things like key exchange and my late arrival.  i would highly recommend his spot.  my only complaint was that i couldn\\'t stay longer.clean, accessible, comfortable, and located in a great area! tons of shops, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. close to public transit. host was very friendly and provided great suggestions of what to do in the area. 10/10 would stay in this location again! we booked with patrick primarily for the convenience and proximity of the location to where we needed to be.  he uses instant book and was available for our desired days.  patrick was responsive and easy to communicate with via email and/or text.  entrance to his building was via remote access, where we got keys to the building and apartment.  the building is old and tired, the hallways narrow and depressing, and the apartment was in keeping with that theme.  we are used to very basic accommodations, but this place didn’t meet the minimum standards for cleanliness.  the condition of the kitchen and bathroom weren’t acceptable for paying guests, and the apartment didn’t seem to have been cleaned in advance of our arrival, despite the fact that we were charged a $30 cleaning fee.  even for folks who are comfortable with lodging that is very basic and are just looking for a place to crash, we would recommend steering clear of this one.  spend a few bucks more and you’ll easily find someplace that’s clean and welcoming.great hosts who make you feel very welcome and cofmortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended.andy and erin were the ideal hosts for my first airbnb experience! i was admittedly a little apprehensive about sharing someone\\'s home, but the minute my reservation was confirmed, andy was super accommodating and very cool. he and erin definitely welcomed my girlfriend and me into their home like new friends-- not just weekend visitors. \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir location is great for a quick stroll down to the beach, or into golden gate park. it doesn\\'t hurt they\\'re basically spitting distance to outerlands where i had one of the most delightful dinners in a long while (but i\\'ll keep this from turning into a yelp review).\\r\\n\\r\\nmy only big regret is that calamitous scheduling forces cut our stay shorter than we had originally planned, so we were not able to spend much time chilling at home with our hosts! i would have loved to sit down to some dinner with them, and we were all sad that it wasn\\'t in the cards this weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut there\\'s always next time!we absolutely loved this place.  great views from the living room and master bedroom.  floor plan is very open, so everyone felt like they were together the whole time.  very cool back patio for lounging as well.  neighborhood was quiet and tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  jennifer was also a great host.  easy to reach and very responsive.   two thumbs up! great experience and great place. would definitely stay again, and jennifer was very helpful.the place was awesome.  very spacious, with 4 separate bedrooms, 2 of which are masters. there is plenty of open space inside for activities which is very hard to come by in the bay area.  there is a full kitchen, a hot tub, and lovely views facing east across the bay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nour stay was only 2 nights but we would\\'ve liked to stay longer to enjoy the place.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe back patio offered a great open, yet private outdoor space with flowers growing over artfully stained wood decking.  it also boasts a fire pit, barbecue, and sound system throughout.  what\\'s not to love?\\r\\n\\r\\nvery easy check in, very nice place, great views, plenty of space.  \\r\\ngather some friends and explore the city from this excellent spot. we had a fantastic time staying at jennifer\\'s listing! \\neasy and convenient check-in and check-out, greeted by a bottle of vintage syrah, and also, fresh towels for each guest. \\nmy friends and i had a great time making s\\'mores in the backyard fireplace, exploring the neighborhood, and getting plenty of beauty sleep in her super comfy beds! the indoor parking garage and double entry gate made our stay very convenient and safe. spacious living space, large dining table, and plenty of natural lighting made this stay incredibly pleasant and comfortable. \\nwe had a really packed schedule so didn\\'t have the time to enjoy many of the other amenities offered. i.e. sound system, gas stove, laundry machines, jacuzzi, and honor bar.\\nbut this was a fantastic experience and if i ever am back in town, i would love to return. thank you again jennifer for opening your home up to us. you\\'ve been integral in contributing to our very positive experience. jennifer is terrific. she responded immediately to questions and made us feel wonderfully welcome. the home is in a great location with beautiful views of the city, and just a few streets from bernal heights park with fantastic 360-degree views of the city. the home was clean and comfortable and furnished with everything we needed. after a day full of touring, our kids loved making s\\'mores over the fire pit and relaxing in the hot tub. we would love to come back!jennifer\\'s home was absolutely amazing. i booked for business, and she was easy to work with, and made checking in all our guests a breeze. i will definitely be booking with her again.i cannot say enough about the jennifer, our amazing host, and her beautiful home! the house was gorgeous, comfortable, clean, and had great amenities. jennifer was extremely responsive and helpful throughout the whole experience. we were traveling with a group from several locations, and she communicated easily and quickly so that none of us had any difficulty. each of us would recommend staying there again!i had the most pleasant experience coordinating my stay at jennifer\\'s beautiful home. my fiance (now husband) were in the midst of planning a civil ceremony at city hall (with family visiting from la and washington dc) over thanksgiving weekend and needed a space that would accommodate my husband\\'s family - 7 adults and two kids. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was the perfect find! from beginning to end, communicating with jennifer was seamless and most enjoyable. everyone loved the house, particularly the long family style dining table and the outdoor fire pit. upon arrival, gary\\'s family was greeted with a bottle of wine and a house that felt much like home! \\r\\n\\r\\nwe can\\'t thank you enough for making our wedding week so memorable and comfortable for the family. thanks, jennifer!it was an amazing experience! first of all the communication is great with jennifer. the house is amazing with great spacing and very clean. would definitely book again with her in the future. jennifer was a great and responsive host. when a slight mishap occurred upon arrival, we sent her a text, and she responded asap, fixed it immediately and saved christmas dinner for our family! yay! the house is beautiful and sits atop a hill, providing great views of the city. the only note is that there is some construction happening right outside the house, which obstructed the view a little bit, but no big deal and we quickly got over that by enjoying our time in her beautiful home. the beds are super comfy; house was very clean; huge dining table. overall, it was a very pleasant experience and jennifer\\'s quick responses and concern made the stay even better.this house was amazing! very comfortable, clean, and great area! jennifer was an amazing, couldn\\'t ask for a better host!it was an amazing experience. the house was perfect and so comfortable. it has everything you need to have a wonderful stay. just like home!!\\ngreetings from guadalajara, méxico.everything was as described! the home was beautiful - thank you so much!this was definitely the best airbnb experience i have had so far jennifer was a amazing host and was so helpful and quick to respond to any of our needs. the house was better then in the pictures and perfect for my gf and our friends. the house was very clean and everything worked like a charm, really have no complaints and would love to stay here again in the near future. thank you again for everything jennifer!i booked with jennifer for some co-workers who were coming into town for the week - every part of working with jennifer was beyond wonderful! she was incredibly welcoming and very communicative and informative. my co-workers loved their stay and we hope to book with jennifer again in the future! thanks again!!the apartment was clean, spacious and nicely decorated. the host was accessible and helpful. the only downside is the location. staying in bernal heights you miss out on the sf vibe of the city by the bay.i just came back from my trip and couldn\\'t wait to write my review.  the house was perfect.  just as described. but the best thing about renting this house was how wonderful jennifer is. her quick response to any question and her thoughtfulness with making sure our stay was enjoyable made her the perfect host.  the house is well stocked with everything you need. jennifer has thought of everything.we absolutely loved our stay at the bernal heights property! we were in the city to celebrate our wedding weekend, and needed a place close to sf city hall that could accommodate us along with 6 close friends that flew in to celebrate with us. the house was spacious, clean and comfortable for all of us, and approximately 10 - 20mins from almost everywhere we wanted to go in the city. our host, jennifer was super nice and responsive, and really helped to make the weekend memorable. thank you!jennifer was a great host. easy to contact, very responsive and helpful with tips about local restaurants. she made it very easy to get in and out. parking was great. the location was easy access to other parts of the city. i traveled with 2 male colleagues for work and everyone had privacy and space. we all felt comfortable and safe at all times. the amenities were fantastic, plenty of rooms, lovely baths and kitchen, and great outdoor space with a hot tub! definitely recommend to anyone looking for a spacious well appointed place to stay in the city.\\r\\nthe place was perfect for four co-workers to share while visiting sf for a work-related trip. comfortable beds and spacious, private bathrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\njennifer was an accommodating host! she arranged for us to drop off luggage a couple hours early, and was very responsive during check-in.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is beautiful - great views, comfortable lounging spaces, and sweet perks (fire pit, hot tub, large dining table). \\r\\n\\r\\nwe all enjoyed our stay, and we all wished we could have stayed longer!the house was spacious and comfortable, and felt roomy enough for our group of 7. jennifer responded promptly to any questions/concerns both before and during our stay at her home. \\r\\n\\r\\nparking was a little tricky as we had 3 vehicles and there was construction going on across the street. i\\'d recommend bringing 1 car and utilizing the garage! the host was quick to respond to any and all questions i had during my stay at her amazing home.  it was the perfect place to spend my 30th birthday weekend with the ones i love.  jen was nice enough to leave me a sweet birthday note with a bottle of wine! extremely thoughtful! the home was spacious for the 5 of us and the kitchen had everything we needed to make breakfast before heading out to explore the city.  i will definitely stay here during my ned trip to san fran. great house. great price for a 4 bedrooms. nice neighborhood.jennifer must be the perfect airbnb host. available, reliable and friendly. the house was clean and in perfect order when we arrived. the neighborhood is safe and beautiful, with just a short walk to bernal heights park. we are sure it is normally very quiet as well, although during our stay there were some noise from constructions across the street. with down-town sf just 10- 15 minutes drive away our vacation in brewster street became memorable days for all of us. jennifer\\'s place is awesome. way larger than i was expecting for san francisco, and in especially good shape. i had a large group of relatives - eight adults altogether - stay there for a weekend and they all slept comfortably. the living room and patio are especially impressive. just some advice to others who may stay there - you may want access to a car (or just be prepared to use rideshare apps) as it\\'s a bit of a walk to public transit. very nice neighborhood otherwise with great views of downtown. i didn\\'t get to meet jennifer in person but she was a great communicator when we needed anything, and a generous host.i\\'d like to say jennifer words of gratitude for our great vacation in sf. the house was super. big, clean, cosy. all necessary facilities are there. there is big terrace. jennifer was very hospitable and helpful. if you want to stay in sf for several days it is best place. a beautiful and tastefully decorated house offering all necessary amenities and a lovely view over the city. it is spacious and cosy, with a luxury feel to its interior and exterior – a real treat. jennifer is a lovely and very accommodating host, very quick to respond to any queries. i would highly recommend to anyone planning to stay in san francisco.  jennifer is an awesome host! everything was so clear before getting to the house, but whatever question i\\'ve asked her, her reply was immediate and perfect! house is beautiful, big bedrooms and a huge living room!our stay was just lovely! jennifer is an amazing host, so nice and helpful! the house itself was neat and clean, and perfect for a group of 8 to stay in comfortably. the only downside is that there is construction (just on weekdays) right across the street that was quite loud, but since we weren\\'t at the house too much during the day, it wasn\\'t too big of a deal. overall we highly recommend it!this house was a $20 uber from the airport and was absolutely beautiful! the house is very new with lots of space. there are two masters and we took the master bedroom downstairs because it had the tv and hot tub. the house was clean. modern, and stocked with coffee and creamer and shampoos and conditioner.  and after a 5 minute walk, we found a cool hiking trail with a 360 view of the city and not much further was  cafes and shops. we had a wonderful stay here and would highly recommend this property.  the outdoor fireplace and the huge kitchen table were both highlights of the house. only complaint would be the nearby construction that woke us up at early hours of the morning, and the house can be a little confusing to find for some uber drivers....other than that our stay was perfect!place is awesome! very good location especiallly considering the price. perfect size for our group that stayed, house was stocked with everything we needed - even has a home speaker system you can connect to via bluetooth! (just be careful, we didn\\'t know there were speakers outside, so when you\\'re playing the music loud inside, it\\'s also just as loud outside) jennifer was also very quick to respond to all our questions couple days before checking in. top notch host and house!everyone who stayed in the home was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness, coziness and how it was so inviting.  i had a group staying in san francisco who attended the annual sid (society for information display) show.  they felt it was very comfortable and nice.  great experience!! the house is well located with good access to the airport, city, hwy 1 and 101. the four bedrooms, huge garage, fire pit and hot tub were great features for a house in the city... jennifer was easy to reach and very courteous during our stay. jennifer was an excellent host, she made our entire experience easy, from booking the reservation to our stay and our check out.\\r\\n\\r\\nher home was beautiful, clean, and very comfortable. this is a perfect house for a family or for a business group. the rooms are spacious, the kitchen well equipped, the back patio is perfect for some wine after a day out exploring the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bed rooms are good sized with plenty of space to hang your clothes and the beds are comfy. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is safe, filled with character and views! and has a great central location to almost anything in san fran. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks, jennifer for such a wonderful stay!this was our first time in san francisco with family from lithuania and we were impressed! bernal heights area is gorgeous! it\\'s only few minutes away from stunning panoramic views!  the house is was great! very tidy and specious! too bad we had  to leave so soon :(  i rented jennifer\\'s space for a two day work retreat. we were seeking a space where our groups of 7 could meet during the day and where the 3 people visiting from out of town could sleep at night. the space was fantastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe rooms were comfortable. the kitchen large and well stocked. ample bathrooms. nicely furnished with a big table that easily fit all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space is in bernal heights which is not an area that i had ever been to in my prior 20-30 bay area visits. however, it has a great downtown and there are lovely views to be had as it stands high atop a hill.\\r\\n\\r\\na few things to know. i don\\'t think that this is a great place to stay if you are completely dependent on public transport, but with lyft and uber around we had folks to take us wherever within minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\njennifer was a great host and super responsive with my few requests.\\r\\nif you seek a highly stimulating environment with comfortable accommodations in a prime location in sf, look no further! i highly recommend staying here. :)nice place to stay, location is great. within walking distance to fisherman wharf and union square.\\nlouis is friendly and the place is clean. great place to share ideas and expand networkstaying at serendipia was really fun! if you are headed to sf and would like to get a taste of the startup community and some fun, you should consider this place! location is great!due to personal reasons, i could not go to san fransisco to stay with jean & louis. louis communicated with me a lot and he was very warm and welcoming. he was disappointed that i could not make it. even offered discount during my next visit. i felt welcomed by him.louis was a great host and was very helpful throughout the stay. the house is located in a very nice neighborhood. louis goes out of his way to make sure everyone feels at home. this home was spotless and the host clearly thought of the many details that make a stay comfortable. however, i am sorry to report that this listing was not \"entire place\" as the one bathroom is shared with a tenant living below, making it quite awkward for my family\\'s stay, and more that a little disconcerting in the middle of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nvery unfortunate, as the home and fenced garden are quite nice.my family and i had a great stay at rebecca\\'s home. the house was amazing, clean, and comfortable. the host even provided snacks and juice for us! the only concern i had was the roommate, but he was hardly home. so we didn\\'t even notice that there was a roommate. would definitely recommend!beautiful home and very clean! host was very very accommodating and made the stay special and easy. thank you very much!!!!seth and rebecca’s house was awesome! at first the house looked small from the outside but as soon as we walked in and saw the three private rooms, it was very cool.  cable in all the rooms, lots of bedding stuff, super cozy.we really loved the loft room, what a score. the back decks were perfect for our friends to hang out, they had all these great outdoor lights at night too; the house has two decks with patio furniture on both decks. pond was cool too. rebecca and seth made our stay in san francisco so enjoyable. the place was super clean and organized, they even left us some snacks, coffee and tea. what a gem find in san francisco…\\n\\nthe 43 bus was only a block away, which was cool because it took us right to academy of sciences/golden gate park.  whole foods was really close to walk, plus they left us a stack of food delivery places-which was convenient. place was very easy to get to from sfo about 20 minutes, there was plenty of street parking.we rented the whole home, which was 3 bedrooms on 3 different levels, and one bathroom on the middle level. the bedroom on the the third level requires climbing a ladder, which was fine for us and would be great for kids.  all beds were super comfortable.  we cooked christmas dinner in the kitchen and hosted a party of 8.  the home has two very nice outdoor decks with great views of the city.  there is also a fenced in garden area with a koi pond.  the home is also about a half-mile to a variety of stores, including a safeway, whole foods, cvs, wagreens, and a variety of restaurants.  this was a very comfortable and convenient location for all of our needs.shruthi and her husband were fantastic hosts. i felt very welcome. the place is super clean and the patio is a very nice place to relax and get some work done during the day. the private bathroom is accessible through the bedroom and is nice and spacious. there is also a nice big closet in the room. i\\'d stay here again and highly recommend to friends. \\r\\nshruthi, hitin are great and welcoming hosts. the apartment is beautiful and well taken care off. the neighborhood offers some fantastic dining and nightlife options and provides easy access to the bart system to get around san francisco. i would recommend this location to any future travelers. our stay in the mission was just what we were looking for: centrally located, modern, and friendly. would highly recommend a stay with shruthi & hitin, they are super accommodating, responsive & respectful and they made our stay in sf memorable. be sure to get their recommendations for ice cream - you will be glad you did!my stay was very pleasant. the host made me feel welcome with their friendly manner and the gratis coffee, tea, and animal crackers. i loved the neighborhood. it\\'s great for long walks, jogs, or just gazing out the window at the ocean. there were great chinese restaurants a few blocks away and a park across the street. staying with aya was a good experience; the place was exactly what it sounded like (very clean!), everyone was kind and gracious, checking in and out was very easy. i will definitely consider staying there again if i come back!the description and the pictures are one hundred percent accurate. i had a nice stay here; an incredibly welcoming host, the place was fresh and clean and the neighbour was very safe. it was also a good mixture of people that were staying there. \\r\\ni would definitely recommend it and wouldn\\'t mind to come back again :).when it comes to a san fransico stay, this airbnb is the cream of the crop. in my eyes i travel all over the world and have stayed in a lot of fabulous place and to be a airbnb. travel geeks have really put something special together for there guest. if i had to compare it so a hotel chain i would say \"the four seasons\" just the hostel version. when you first check it there host (gm) orland will have everything labeled for you, suffer as sleeping and free snacks and you shelves to house your things. i have a been of ocd but nothing like orland the guy has the place spotless top to bottom. you would thing they staffed a three person cleaning crew. (p.s.) i\\'ve never stayed in a hostel or prior to this but the warm friendly energy combined with the amazing conversation has me reconsidering booking 4 and 5 star hotels just for the great environment travel geek provides.    nice hostel, nice neighborhood. alltogether nice experience! i\\'m probably going backvery good location and unbelievable views from appartmentnathan and carolyn were extremely friendly and gracious hosts. the apartment was clean, and just as advertised. the location is pretty ideal, within walking distance to the nest of north beach, embarcadero, and the financial district. highly recommended if you need a long-term place in san francisco! great price, great ppl.jonathan was a terrific host. he was incredibly accommodating of my difficult schedule and last minute scheduling changes due to travel delays. he was present and communicative; all in all, a first rate guy. the place is great as well - a great location and well stocked with drinks and snacks. jonathan makes sure his guests are well taken care of. i\\'d stay at his place again in a second  i couldn\\'t have had a better experience at jonathan\\'s place during my stay in san fran. jonathan was communicative, accommodating, and flexible with my arrival and departure time. he is super down to earth and went the extra mile to make sure i had a great stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nhis apartment is great. sleek, minimalistic, yet homey and the best part- super clean. i didn\\'t want to leave. i had to do some work during my stay, and he happened to have a beautiful monitor i could use. the tv had all the entertainment options, so it was tough to leave. but, leaving was a breeze. download the muni app, and you\\'ll realize you are a stone\\'s throw away (if you have a good arm) from a muni stop that will take you right into downtown. super convenient. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is great as well. you\\'ll be staying like a local. super close to mission and valencia st. i will certainly be back to san fran and i hope his place will be available. thanks jonathan!  i had a lovely stay at jonathan\\'s apartment. it\\'s spacious, clean, and has all the necessities: great natural light, a television (for netflix and chill time), and a comfortable bed. jonathan is welcoming, super responsive, and took care of things quickly. i was visiting for work and was rarely at the apartment but it was a pleasant place to relax whenever i was. perfect location, too—close to tons of restaurants, cafés, and corner stores. would definitely recommend and stay again.staying at jonathan\\'s place was ideal. the space is clean and comfortable. his attention to design is apparent in every detail. the bed is memory foam. the shower has hot, strong water. the electronics are second to none! jonathan was easy to work with and available to answer questions. and the location is wonderfully central. great experience all round. spoke to chris on the telephone before we arrived as they were off on holiday but actually wasn\\'t necessary as their notes are fantastically helpful and comprehensive. loved the house, spacious and light and comfortable. lovely welcoming letter and bottle of wine waiting for us. area is great. park ( holly park) around corner with great playground for our youngest (7) and baseball pitch for older ones. it was closed but they climbed over low fence and were happy and undisturbed for hours. in the same street there is another playground and also basketball courts so for us with four boys, they were in heaven. cortland avenue (think that\\'s right) at top of hill has lovely restaurants, friendly people and good vibe. it feels like an up and coming area.pretty houses , some developed some not. didn\\'t get public transport, we drove and parked, but traffic depending didn\\'t feel like we were far out but equally nice to come back to as more peaceful and less hectic than downtown.  it was perfect for us and would suit most people as has so much to offer. thank you chris and jennifer.our host provided us with highly detailed information about the house and everything was neat and tidy. the neighbourhood was really nice and quiet, with a lot of handy shops nearby. \\r\\njennifer and her family were extremely kind, helping us out with our every query and making our stay very pleasant and comfortable.the house was simply perfect for our family. it is very convenient to get to down town and yet in  a very quiet neighbourhood . perfect after a busy day touring!

bernal heights is a lovely suburb of the city and we thoroughly enjoyed the stay. 2 minutes to some great boutique restaurants and coffee shops etc.great place. very quiet neighborhood, and a nicely furnished house. the kitchen has all you need, and the beds are very comfortable. everything works in the house, and the hosts were very quick to answer any questions. the host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the host canceled this reservation 21 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the house is not clean at all ...bed sheet is duty and we saw a mouse in the basement...and one day we locked the door downstairs by accident and couldn\\'t open it,we called the host he even doesn\\'t know where is the keys...everything was super clean and really nice! the neighborhood was super quite and close to the city. we had enough space and utilities for everything. always again beautiful property and great value but too cold for kids.  check in was very easy and it is a large and clean house but absolutely freezing inside.  washer unit and thermostat were broken and it took 24 hours for property management to respond to my requests.  by then my whole family was sick from a second night in a 59 degree house.  great neighborhood.  very close to laundromat thankfully and other stores and restaurants.  not many tv channels but there\\'s so much to do in town it\\'s not an issue.\\r\\nvery nice place!house was wonderful.  great location and great price.  unique and spacious remodel.  sleeps 4 people very comfortably.  or 8 couples i guess.the listing description was very accurate and the neighborhood has very good transport connection - you get to the city centre in half an hour.\\r\\nwe were eight people, came to sf for a conference, and the house could easily accommodate all of us. absolutely recommended.this place is great on space and facilities. indoor parking, separate rooms for plenty people, big dining room, and backyard. would love to go back again if with the group.\\nthe place is very nice. love the instant booking. definitely has everything you need for a comfortable stay. alexander was very accommodating to my group and responded quickly to my message inquiries. overall, we had a great stay and the price was unbeatable. the only thing i would recommend needs improvement is to update the listing on the size of the beds. one of the rooms lists a king size bed, but it\\'s actually a queen size bed. other than that, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend.we spent 2 month in ca mostly in air bnb homes, and this was our last- was a perfect ending as you could literally drive in to the house- made the final pack to easy- \\r\\n\\r\\nis a lovely easy house, in a great area- really spacious and great beaches. the house wasn\\'t ready for us when we arrived. but it was absolutely fabulous once ready. lots of room. well kept. 10 out of 10.the host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.location is fantastic, close to water and quiet area. \\nthe house is charming, plenty of space and the kitchen was fun to cook in ( gas range hooray )!\\n\\nwould definitely stay again!

we had a pleasant experience and would recommend this place for friends and family. great place to stay in san francisco. quiet neighborhood close to restaurants and parks. house was very spacious and clean, beds were extremely comfortable. overall no complaints from me or my group. the area is very quiet and pretty close to the bus stop (about two blocks away). the house itself is very charming and decorated nicely. we had nearly everything we needed! i booked this place very last minute though so i didn\\'t have very much time to communicate with alex beforehand about check in procedure -- but once we were there, we were able to get a hold of the host pretty quickly and get the code to access the house. i\\'m so glad we were able to find a place so close to the city at so last minute -- thank you alex!roomy, comfortable home in quiet neighborhood.  downtown was a quick $18    uber ride.we had a wonderful time. it was really close to golden gate bridge and the host was lovely. best part was having our own garage to park. the house is only a few blocks from restaurants as well. the house was perfect for what we needed, in a great area close to public transportation. would definitely recommend staying here! julia is a great host. she emailed me detailed directions to the place and was very prompt in response to text. the place was very clean and neatly arranged. it was my first trip to sfo and she was kind enough to give me a quick tour of the area. i had my privacy all during my stay and my host was just a text away if i needed anything. i had a fresh pot of coffee every morning and banana! she has lived in the city for a long time and very knowledgeable! please do make use of her recommendations on what to do around the city. the stay here made my trip very productive and a great experience staying at a loft!julia was very friendly and accommodating.  she knows much about the surrounding area and was very helpful with helping me to find parking, places to eat, and suggestions for things to do. i would gladly stay with her again.absolutely cannot say enough great things about my first airbnb experience!  i was in town for rsa and the location, comfort, but most importantly the host was phenomenal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nmy experience started with a very informative text message offering me to drop my luggage at her office and get to the conference.  she then offered me two great suggestions to meet my clients and then printed me a map and perfect directions.  does that say enough?  but wait there is more...alot more.\\r\\n\\r\\njulia completely goes out of her way to be accommodating and the level of detail and care that she takes in doing so is noteworthy.  her home is immaculate, she responds immediately to text messages and i ended up having my own private restroom.  i have doubts that any future airbnb experience will top this!  thank you!julia is a fantastic host!  she made every effort to accommodate my (erratic) schedule.  she is very engaging and makes great conversation, provided me with breakfast options every morning and guided me around her neighbourhood to my destinations.  the proximity to moscone center is unbeatable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bed is incredibly comfortable and the temperature of the room is perfect for sleeping.  despite the close access to transit, the area is very quiet and the balcony provides a great overlook of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would absolutely stay here again, and encourage everyone else visiting san francisco to do the same.very lovely space, and julia is incredibly kind and accommodating. if you\\'re at a loss for what to do or see, she has plenty of suggestions. being so close to the bart station is a definite plus. i had a great time staying here.this was my first airbnb trip, and it was for business. julia was very nice and made the experience a great one. she is very knowledgeable about the area and provided a few great things to check out. her place was clean and comfortable. i would definitely stay again if i was coming back to sf.julia was a great host.  she made herself available to answer questions, provide recommendations, coordinate transportation (including detailed directions for public transportation), etc., and discuss the events of the day.  she is very engaged - in the city, with her guest, in life in general.  her place is extremely convenient to the moscone convention center (2 minute walk), where i spent much of my time as this was a business trip, but also to downtown.  nice neighborhood, gentrifying, but a block or two east and south it starts to become more sketchy.  her unit, on the 5th floor, is comfortable, safe and quiet, just what i needed.  felt like i was staying with a friend!i had a blast. julia was very helpful regarding all aspects of my visit. she managed to keep up with my fussy schedule visiting wwdc. staying just around the corner of moscone was great. the comfort of her place made it my best visit of wwdc. wow what a place!. perfectly located to bars and a market only meters away. it is a only short cab or bus ride into the main party districts and tourist attractions.. \\n\\nthe actual appartment is massive. plenty big enough for our 5 guests. the bathrooms and bedrooms are spacious and well designed. the kitchen, well you won\\'t want to eat out all trip. it was a delight to cook in.\\n\\npepijn was a dream to deal with and there were no hassles at all.. we booked on a little late notice but nothing was a drama.. \\n\\ni can not recommended this apartment enough.  next time i come to san francisco i will be hopefully staying here again!.\\n\\nthanks pepijn.we (8 of us) had a fantastic stay in the dream house.  everything was just as advertised, and the place was exceptionally clean.  the place was plenty big enough for 8 of us.  the house is located in a great area, just a short walk to golden gate park and haight-ashbury district.  after spending a day out in the city, we found the place to be a great refuge before we embarked for nighttime adventures.\\r\\nthe two parking spaces also came in handy and were always available.\\r\\nour hosts respected our privacy, but at the same time, gave us suggestions on what to do in the city while in the city.\\r\\nthe listing has great value; it is tough to find comparable places at such a value.  i highly recommend this house for your next visit to sf with friends!we had a tremendous experience at pepijn and patricia\\'s unit in san francisco!

 the kitchen is big and comfortable, with everything you could need available.  (a nice vase of flowers here, too!) \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was perfectly arranged for guests.  for example, nice bath towels and drinking water carafe and cups were neatly arranged at our bedside.  and look!  more flowers.  what a lovely touch.  the one bathroom on the upper floor has a nice double shower.  if you\\'d rather not share a bathroom with all of your housemates, you could use the equally lovely bathroom on the first floor.   \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was our first experience with airbnb so we didn\\'t know what to expect.  if pepjin\\'s and patricia\\'s place is any indication--we\\'ll be back for sure!the hosts were awesome-- super nice and very responsive. made us feel completely welcome and at home. the place was incredibly clean and beautiful. the kitchen!!!--- wow. and the piano was a very nice touch. it\\'s even in tune :)\\r\\nthe neighborhood was very relaxed and hip with many great restaurants and bars very close by.the home was welcoming, clean, and comfortable. it was very conveniently located and the hosts were available if needed. we would definitely stay here again.this was my first experience booking a room through airbnb, and this property and host did not let me down. we were looking for a house in sf that could fit 8 people plus a baby. we were coming up from san diego to celebrate my 30 birthday, and i am so so glad we found this place. the house was beautiful!

the home was beautifully decorated and had a very welcoming feel. there was a balcony with a hot tub, a backyard, new appliances, plenty of space, super cute decor, and a bright, open, and airy feel to the place. i would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a classy and comfortable place to stay in sf!this is my first time using airbnb, and i was incredibly impressed.  pepijn was wonderful during our preparation for the trip (including help to find a great caterer in the neighborhood).   the accommodations were better than we expected, with every room more lovely than the next.  it was clean and comfortable.  i would highly recommend staying here on your next trip to san francisco.  great place in a convenient neighborhood.  vey clean and comfortable and everything was as described.  pepijn and trish were the perfect hosts.  welcoming and there if we needed them.patricia was a gracious host that catered to our every need; she was always available to communicate with.  the house is spacious, gorgeous, well prepared for guests and exceeded our expectations. the space was large, comfortable and close to several amenities.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou are a 5 minute walk from haight st!

the house was even more beautiful than the pictures and the neighborhood was ideal! we will definitely stay here again in the future! pepijn was a wonderful host and the victorian dream house was truly dreamy! so many details were thought of including plenty of fresh towels, beautiful flower bouquets and even some surprise ice cream. they were available for us throughout check-in and when we had questions about the heat they were quick to respond. the house itself is truly stunning and has obviously been carefully maintained over the years. i hope i can stay here again in the future!

my family and a few friends were flying in to san francisco for my engagement party, and this house proved to be the absolute perfect central hub for them. i live in san francisco, but can\\'t comfortably host, let alone house, eight people in my one-bedroom apartment. pepijn and patricia were incredibly gracious, flexible, and best of all, responsive. they responded to each of my nit-picky questions with grace and care, and within 15 minutes every single time. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house itself is both immaculate and homey, with lots of comfortable and well-lit common areas and nice, private bedrooms. the hot tub was a highlight for my family, as were the comfortable bed and couches. this proved to be a way better, and more cost-effective, alternative for my family than going to a hotel, and i hope we have the occasion to rent out this house again soon!absolutely stunning house that is even better than it looks. pepijn was a considerate and welcoming host, taking the time to show us round the house. no hesitation in recommending.staying at pepijn and patricia\\'s home was completely fantastic! their home was even better than how they describe and show it. it\\'s spacious, clean, inviting, and you can tell how much thought and care they\\'ve put into it- subtle details like a surround sound music system, heated floors, and rolled hand towels in the bathroom are little wonderful surprises! that\\'s on top of the comfortable beds, spa-like bathrooms, and well designed interiors. our group of 5 was so comfortable and happy to stay there and took advantage of the gorgeous outdoor porches and huge chef\\'s kitchen! \\r\\n\\r\\npepijn and patricia were wonderful hosts. they were communicative and so friendly- they helped us feel so welcome and even put fresh cut flowers throughout the host before our arrival! we loved staying here and would happily stay again!even more lovely than the pictures!! my group very much enjoyed staying at this beautiful house. the house is beautiful, spacious, artfully decorated, and very comfortable. everyone commented on how comfortable all the beds were. we were a group of seven women and it was the perfect home base for a girls weekend in the city. plenty of bathroom, counter, and mirror space. and the hot tub!

kitchen is perfect for cooking and a cute deck table outside in the backyard.beautiful house in an excellent location, everything  you could ask for was a short walk or uber away. pepijn was helpful and communicative without being intrusive. the perfect house for our family of 5 in town for my brother\\'s wedding. highly recommended and would stay here again.great place. everything was in order, clean and it was an easy experience checking in and out. our entire group (in sf for a meeting) enjoyed staying in the home. the house has every amenity. we\\'d all do it again. great place to stay, beautiful and right in mission. couldn\\'t ask for a better stay!audry and emily were very friendly. the house is very clean and spacious. the parking on the street is next to impossible but audry/emily were nice enough to let me park in the driveway. the bed was a bit uncomfortable for me. we enjoyed staying with nea so much. she is an amazing host and i couldn\\'t ask for a better host for our first experience with airbnb. the house is beautiful and in a great neighborhood. we walked to golden gate park everyday and always felt safe. would definitely recommend nea. i registered late for dreamforce and found out that it was hard to find a good hotel. so i tried airbnb. nea\\'s place was a good alternative. it was very easy to get to downtown san francisco by bus. \\nthe room was nice and clean and nea is very friendly.\\nthe neighborhood is quiet and peaceful within walking distance from the ocean beach.elizabeth was a pleasure to work with as she was very helpful and responsive.  the home itself was beautiful and very large, with a fantastic open living space great for entertaining.  great home/great view. all 4 guests  made use of the expresso machine. clean, comfortable, great view from roof top patio. safeway loading dock in the back is quite loud in the early morning hours. spacious living room, good place to do some work. only reason to not recommend is the noise from the safeway loading dock but other than that it is as portrayed. san fransisco was going through a heat wave and the windows needed to be opened for venitlation. we had an outstanding stay at this house. \\r\\n\\r\\npros: there are many. elisabeth was an amazing host, very communicative. the house is gorgeous with nearly every amenity you will need including a rooftop patio with a breathtaking 340 degree view of the city. also there is an amazing television and sonos sound setup with netflix, wifi and the ability to project your computer to the television which we used to share photos of our trip. just awesome!\\r\\n\\r\\ncons: there are a few. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. the house is very close to a safeway grocery store and trucks start unloading at 5 am and the air brakes will wake you out of bed with loud voices from the workers on the loading docks. if you are a heavy sleeper, this won\\'t bother you. if you are easily woken, i suggest you get some ear plugs. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. the neighbors are very sensitive to music being played and excited conversations after 11. elisabeth was forthcoming about this but we received a noise complaint for playing jazz at what i consider a reasonable volume & having a conversation between five people drinking wine.  be ready to chill at 11 or this will be a problem. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. the place gets pretty hot during the day if you are here in the summer. the windows do open and when the front door is open, there is a decent breeze but the office is super stuffy when the sun shines in in the summer heat so beware. \\r\\n\\r\\n4. no microwave. this may sound silly but you may miss it if it\\'s something you\\'re used to using to prepare food. \\r\\n\\r\\n5. there are some sketchy people hanging around the streets at night. i wouldn\\'t plan on taking any midnight walks unless you have protection or are in a group. \\r\\n\\r\\ndespite these cons, i would 100% recommend staying in this home and working with elisabeth on your stay. michael was an excellent host. throughout the entire process he was very accessible, made us feel welcome and the whole stay was easy and exceeded expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was perfect for a group of co-workers in town for a few days. it was spacious and centrally located in addition to being a beautiful house! \\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend this property and host.josh is such a great host i really enjoyed my stay in his apartment. communication was great and when he had time he took me out to some great local restaurants. he sure knows his way around the city! his dog, oscar, has become a friend of mine as well so friendly and fun to be around. the apartment itself is fantastic, it had everything i needed for a comfortable stay. i highly reckoned josh as a host and his apartment. another great stay at josh\\'s. it\\'s been over a year since i stayed over at josh\\'s. nothing has changed, still a great experience and amazing hospitality! what can i say that i haven\\'t already. great apartment and an amazing host with a playful dog. awesome spot! loved the way they designed the place! very modern yet lived in.  ryan was extremely easy to communicate with and eager to make sure our event was a success.  the place looks just like the photos. he worked with us to adapt the space to fit our needs, moving some pieces of furniture around to better suit our event.  the location was great too--nice side street that was very easy for our guests to arrive via public transit and there was pretty good parking around.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe\\'ll definitely be booking here again for future events.my overall experience was fantastic renting from ry & ky! \\n\\nbooking: i explained my premise for renting a spot - i was hosting some friends for a birthday celebration. they asked me how many people i would have as their pricing tiers vary, but my price didn\\'t change based on how many people i had which was a relief. \\n\\nphysical appearance of venue: there are two rooms to this venue, the inner room is bright and cheery, it\\'s perfect for hosting. it has a dining table, couches, and a bar area. the first room is not as brightly lit, but has a ping pong and fooseball table. personally i didn\\'t use this room as i was going for the comfy/cozy vibe. i also didn\\'t like the darker room as much as the main room. there is a bathroom as well which is maintained. \\n\\nhosts: super sweet! very responsive and easy-going. their main concern was to ensure that their place is treated with respect. \\n\\noverall, if you\\'re looking to book a spot to host a dinner party or celebration - this is a fantastic venue! parking is difficult, so i\\'d say definitely uber or ensure to leave cars at home. this place is incredible. tons of room and great for any sort of event. it\\'s in a pretty good spot in sf too, with the metreon parking garage about 3 blocks away! \\r\\n\\r\\ni threw an event for about 40-50 people and everyone was comfortable. could\\'ve invited more people. the vibe of the place is cool and i can\\'t say enough positive things about ry and ky. they\\'re laid back but they respond promptly and are very flexible and helpful.this is such a special place. i had a last minute venue cancellation for a pretty big event and had a week to find a new one. kylie is the coolest chick and was super accommodating throughout the entire process. the event turned out incredible and all my guests commented on how rad the space was.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould definitely definitely book again! (cute dogs sometimes make an appearance as well)\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again! i cannot gush enough on how wonderful the space was! ry & ky are fabulous, such a nice and helpful people. i was very excited when i saw the space, it exceeded my expectations and is in a great central location for my guests. everyone was very impressed at my venue choice, and the hosts are the ones that made that possible. i found the space to be hip and comfortable, there\\'s a beautiful flop room, and easy place to set up food and appetizers. we even had a slideshow projection on the wall. ry & ky were great on communication, were helpful, and very sweet. i highly recommending this location for an event, i\\'m looking forward too and i can have another one here myself. thank you guys, it was a wonderful experience!this has been one of the best airbnb experience i have had! first, let me start by saying this is a great spot to host any event. it is easy to access, spacious, and comfortable. the hosts furnished the place with style while remaining minimalistic so it is easy to add some personal touches. but the hosts are what makes this place so awesome. from the initial inquiry to final booking, the communication was flawless. they went above and beyond to be accommodating to any of my requests and they were no nonsense and totally understanding! i will definitely look into renting this place again in a near future. thank you ryan and ky!our teaching staff had amazing offsite meetings at 443 clementina... the hosts couldn\\'t have been more accommodating. the venue was great and the couple is amazing. they set the place up with a sign for guests to know what the location was. we only had around 15 people in the venue but it was perfect for people to relax, talk and have fun. i would definitely recommend this place to others who are looking at hosting a party in the area. ky met us and was so warm and friendly.  was really flexible and had the best personality.  such a breath of fresh air!ryan and ky are absolutely amazing! they are such kind people and made sure we had everything we needed for our event. the space was great- spacious and clean and bright. i would love to host more events here. the place  was amazing hideaway in great location. must do. this listing is awesome. the perfect spot for an event of any kind - the space is super cool, great location on a quiet street in soma, spacious for larger groups, and decor is on point. not only that, but the hosts are really helpful and friendly, which makes the event planning process seamless. will definitely be coming back soon! ryan and ky were very accommodating and attentive. their space was just as beautiful as described and picture on the site. they made everything super simple and efficient from checking in to checking out. their place provided the best working environment for my 6 execs for an offsite meeting. we will definitely use them again in the future for offsite meetings and small events!ry and ky were great hosts! excellent communicators and the space was amazing.had a great time at this very good location. kk was an incredibly kind and welcoming host and made the process really easy, especially since i booked last minute.  the place was very clean and comfortable and had privacy.  would love to stay here again.the apartment was so beautiful and perfectly located. staying there made my stay so much more enjoyable. the reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the house made us felt just like home with lots of adornments in every room just like in the pictures. the location of the house is really good where shops and restaurants are just in walking distance. there is a full set of kitchenware that you could cook with just like at home. we really enjoyed staying at their house and i would recommend it especially if you have a big group or a big family. debra & reed\\'s home was lovely and very well situated. they were very responsive when i had questions i needed answered during my stay. i have already booked their home for my next visit. craig made the whole process very easy. apartment was perfect for our needs.mina was a great host and very responsive to my emails and text messages.  mina\\'s roommates fred and nick were very helpful and hardly ever at the place busy with work.  we loved the location and upscale environment.  it was within a 15-20 minute walk to all the locations around the conference.  the penthouse was very nice, included a nice weight room, lounge area, and outdoor terrace on the first floor.  there\\'s also a cvs and starbucks just a few steps away when you walk outside.  unfortunately we stayed only four days in san francisco, nice apartment for seasonal rental. it maybe lacks a coat rack in the bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nregards,\\r\\nhad a great stay. very convenient location, very clean apartment, nicely decorated.recently, my team and i needed a place to stay for a high-tech conference at the moscone center.  we picked this nob hill property due to the number of rooms available, the price compared to the local hotels, and the proximity to the convention center - about a mile.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni liked the pictures elizabeth posted - but after staying here - i\\'m not sure they do justice to this recently renovated early 1900s sf nob hill home.  the kitchen and master bath have carrera marble countertops and bedrooms and living rooms have the original coved ceilings.   it really is a beautiful property and very conveniently located to several amenities on nob hill - like trader joe\\'s, osso restaurant, and top of the mark @ intercontinental mark hopkins to name a few that mattered to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe master suite deck was a great place to relax with a glass of wine or cocktail when the sf weather cooperated.  we were fortunate to have a couple of nice days.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe enjoyed working and eating in the kitchen area which became our development headquarters for a few days - lots of snacks and beverages around and plenty of room to spread out.\\r\\n\\r\\nelizabeth was an excellent host and worked around our travel schedules to coordinate our arrival at the house - provided the scoop on local amenities - and periodically checked in to make sure we had everything we needed for an excellent stay.  we had such a good time that when it was time to leave - i joked we were keeping the keys.\\r\\n\\r\\na very enjoyable sf experience and a wonderful host family.elizabeth has a beautiful home in a perfect neighborhood, and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. she was very kind, very communicative and very accommodating. she keeps her place very clean, and she left great directions and notes for how to care for the house. she even left travel sized speciality hair products in each bathroom for you to use. \\r\\n\\r\\nif you\\'re lucky enough to stay at their house, you\\'re very much in for a treat. our hosts were gracious and kind.  we rented the space to shoot a product video and felt that we were in the right place.  we would definitely come back to shoot more.the nob hill townhouse was as gorgeous as described online.  it is a large, modern, comfortable home--and it was spotless.  we especially enjoyed the living areas, the contemporary baths,  and the terrace off the master bedroom.  the bedrooms were comfortable and roomy.  the property is located in a quiet neighborhood, but it is close to the nice park on nob hill and there are coffee shops, markets and restaurants nearby.   a beautiful home in an great neighbourhood.  elizabeth made accessing and checkout super easy. visited for business, and actually found working in the house with colleagues was very productive between the kitchen and reception rooms.  bedrooms all spotless and very comfortable.  we managed to spend a couple of evenings on the balcony enjoying the sun go down.\\r\\n\\r\\nelizabeth was very generous with her time in suggesting local drinks and eating establishments. \\r\\n\\r\\nif you have the opportunity, i highly recommend a stay - by the end of our week it truly felt like \\'home\\'.elizabeth\\'s place was great!!  our company used her place to host three employees at her lovely home for a week.  it was absolutely perfect.  the apartment was clean, spacious, and perfect distance from our office downtown/mid market (walking distance).  she was super helpful, easy to communicate with and very accommodating.  we will absolutely be using her place again in the future.  thanks elizabeth!! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was beautiful and the location was fantastic! my family and i had a wonderful time.  elizabeth was very communicative and easy to get a hold of with any questions.  i would stay here again!beautiful large home with fantastic view of sf. parking sometimes requires an acrobatic feat. nice neighbourhood. host was absent but managed things perfectly. a big house that was great for our team as everyone had their own spacious room and bathroom with plenty of privacy throughout.  it has an amazing view out over the castro and san francisco.the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this place is truly amazing! i was looking for a place for 12 guys for a weekend in sf and there aren\\'t many places available. after my original booking was canceled last minute, i found this place and it was better than i could have expected. matt\\'s posting is true or better than he described. the one thing i didn\\'t expect was the abundance of parking in this part of sf. the views on top floor and rooftop are amazing and i could stay there looking at the views all day. i can\\'t say anything negative about this place and matt was in constant communication with me throughout my stay. i absolutely recommend this place for large groups and the price is worth it. thanks for everything matt!the host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the house was large and beautiful (lots of stairs!). it was a perfect evening venue for my girlfriend\\'s birthday party. since there isn\\'t a tv in the house, we used a projector to project onto the large living room wall.great house would definitely recommend, i didn\\'t want to leave the house it was incredible! had a blast!! the host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.i stayed with talia for two nights this summer during a trip to san francisco. i felt like we had been friends for years. she was so fun, accommodating, and we ended up having a blast! she even let me borrow her clothing for a night out with friends :) her and her partner alex are as sweet as can be. would definitely stay here again during my next trip out west. eric and barb were wonderful hosts! this was a first time experience for us using airbnb and we couldn\\'t have asked for a better host.  they were attentive, outgoing and respectful of our space.  the room was clean, and had many amenities you wouldn\\'t find in an average hotel. i would definitely use them again!eric and barb were excellent hosts. my dad was visiting me for the weekend (i live in the area) and they made us feel like welcome guests and friends right from the start. the room is cozy and private and fully stocked with snacks and a nice big tv. it\\'s in a convenient location and i\\'d totally recommend staying here!this was my fourth airbnb experience and it was mind blowing yet again! eric and barb are great hosts and extremely detail oriented yet flexible. the room looks exactly like shown in the pictures and described in the posting. they have taken care of every single thing you would need during your stay - starting from basic necessities to rich entertainment, everything! the only negative is that the room does not get a lot of sunlight since there are no direct windows in the room. but a very convenient location of the building and the quality of service you get from eric/barb easily outweigh this negative. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall, i highly recommend this place and probably going to extend my stay here! eric and barb are very kind hosts, and have a cute room in their place! i love the snacks and drinks available, which were perfect for me after long work hours. they\\'ve done a nice job with detailing and are very attentive. and pigeon is super cute!great hosts who went the extra mile to make sure i was comfortable and had everything i needed.  lots of nice extra touches including free toiletries, minibar and cable tv.  a very comfortable room meant i had a good night\\'s sleep every night.  eric and barb were very friendly and sociable and i would certainly stay here again.staying with eric & barb was the absolutely perfect.  first the room: everything you could need and more! there is plenty of space to put your things. the bed is soft but provides supports and linens are top of the line. the room is very well lit, with lamps that allow you to create the mood you want. then there is the set up: microwave, mini fridge, snacks, coffee, drinks and more. the bathroom is clean, set with towels and every toiletry you need. the temp in the room was perfect and i slept like a baby every night. the building is centrally located, super easy to get from the airport and accessible. most importantly, you feel super safe at the building and in the room. second: eric & barb! they are the perfect hosts and attend to your every need. communication was easy and attentive. they got me the food i requested and had it waiting for me on my arrival. it was so awesome to talk to them and i felt at home from the moment we met. i only wish we could have had more chances to talk but i was super busy with work. i only hope their place is available every time i go to sf, but its so great that i will need lots of luck! thank you eric & barb, you are the best! eric & barb were lovely hosts. they saved my life as i had no bag as i arrived (airline problem) and i got everything to enjoy my time in sf. great, clean and comfortable room and a tv which is men\\'s dream. ;-)\\r\\ni would definitely recommend their place. thank you!!!nice stay at eric & barb\\'s. their apartment was very conveniently located closed to my office. i didn\\'t spend a lot of time there, but it was very convenient for the few hours i was spending every day: private bathroom with all amenities, rooms with coffee machine, microwave, cable tv, etcfirst airbnb experience - but couldn\\'t have matched any better!! the rooms are very cozy, comfy, clean and  set up with love to details... and barb&eric are just awesome:))  \\n\\nlocated very central with lots of amenities just within a short walking distance. also train, muni and bus around the corner that take you everywhere.\\n\\nwe didn\\'t miss anything and definetly will be there again on our next  visit to sf!  had a great time :)\\n\\nand thanks to youtwo  for your always helping hands,too!\\n\\nmiriam&dennisour first trip with airbnb was a excellent one, after many long days of venturing up and down hills around town nothing was better then coming home to a nice comfy bed with amazing sheets and a huge tv with every channel you could imagine. we found ourselves at times wanting to stay in more then go out as we had everything at our fingertips which was excellent for those lazy night. eric and barb were also great hosts, sharing some local tips from favourite restaurants to just getting around the city. if the rest of our airbnb accommodations are like this, i don\\'t see myself staying in a hotel any time soon!  thanks again eric and barb your hospitality was much appreciated!  :d\\r\\n\\r\\n-cdi rented this for my folks for a weekend visit.  it was super nice to have them just around the corner. barb and eric were kind and helpful and the room is clean & exactly as pictured and described.  my folks said the bed was comfy too!wonderful and generous hosts.. great location and accommodations.. all the extras you would like and more.. !  loved greetings from pigeon the cat each day and  we will surely return\\r\\ncarolyn and rickthey were great hosts. would definitely stay here again!my stay at eric and barb\\'s space was great. my room/bathroom were clean and neat. the bed was very comfortable. eric and barb were very accommodating and friendly. the place was very nicely equipped and had almost any snack or popular drink items available at a very reasonable price.  met eric and their cat pigeon who were both very nice during our short stay.  everything was just as stated in the bio.  communicating with eric and barb via texting was very easy and they were very responsive.  was easy to get to using public transportation from sfo.  caught the bart, then a bus for 5 blocks and we were there.  after doing some exploring we found we were only about 2 blocks from the 4th and king station so it was very easy to get to the piers and also to most of the stadiums (since they are closing candlestick park after this season\\'s football, not sure how tough it will be to get to the new stadium).  overall, a nice comfortable place to stay.eric & barb are well reviewed for a reason. they were excellent hosts, communication was great, the room is arguably better than most hotels and they are very nice people in general. you definitely have your privacy if you want it and the stay there was absolutely top notch. many amenities provided at a reasonable cost and well below what a hotel would charge. also their cat is about as friendly as i\\'ve met!this was my first experience with airbnb.  i can highly recommend it.  eric and barb were perfect hosts and it was my pleasure to stay with them.  i would recommend them to everyone.  \\r\\nbrenda patterson\\r\\nalabamaeric and barb were excellent hosts! so helpful and considerate, we felt like we were right at home. plus the sheets and bedding were incredibly comfortable. would definitely stay there again when we\\'re back in the sf area! eric & barb were very helpful and prompt in communicating with us while we were planning our stay, as well as during our stay in their home. the room was everything as described and was very comfortable. eric & barb were great hosts who provided fantastic recommendations about the city. we had a long list of things to do and see, and they gave insight to other attractions and the best mode of transportation/direction in order to make our trip flow smoothly. it was awesome having a local\\'s perspective! eric & barb were both very friendly and gave us space to explore on our own, but were always there to give us great advice. their space is in a perfect location of the city, and we would highly recommend staying with them! exactly what we needed-a place to stay close to the city. surrounding neighborhood is safe compared to some stories i\\'ve heard from friends staying at other airbnb locations within the city. they really went out of their way to add extra things like a mini fridge, snacks, toiletries, microwave, etc. it\\'s a shame we were too busy exploring the city to really stay in and enjoy it all. hosts are nice, accommodating and friendly, room and private bathroom were both clean but did smell a little like their cat. bikes were not available to use but there were plenty of places to rent that were close. two days before coming i requested an extra set of keys and since they didn\\'t have time to make an extra set, they let us use their own copy and had to share with each other, which i thought was very nice of them. i would recommend staying there and would stay there again myself. i stayed here for a week while in town on business. it\\'s a fantasticly comfortable room and private bathroom and eric and barb have gone above and beyond in terms of providing 5 star amenities including an amazing array of snacks and drinks that put expensive mini-bars to shame.the hosts are very efficient in terms of coordinating arrival details and making sure you have whatever you need. alas, i was working most of the time and didn\\'t get to spend too much time chatting, but in my brief interactions they were extremely friendly and welcoming. the apartment is conveniently located in soma with a 20 min walk or short cab ride to the financial district and easy access to other parts of the city. would definitely stay here again.\\r\\n\\r\\ni stayed here for a week while visiting the city.  eric & barb where vary friendly and offered great advice on the city.  you have a private bathroom and all the amenities you could need.  also had no problem walking or using uber to get to anywhere i wanted to in the city.  only down side is no window, but over all i would highly recommend them as hosts!!eric and barb were extremely hospital, super friendly and attentive to all my needs. the room was comfortable, quiet and had everything i could\\'ve asked for, bathroom amenities, snacks, coffee, tv, temperature control. i highly recommend choosing eric and barb\\'s place as your home away from home when staying in san francisco!eric & barb were great hosts, arranging to meet shortly after arriving back in san francisco before heading to the apartment to be shown around.  the room is perfect and you definitely get a great nights sleep every night.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s in a great location for walking around the city and fairly close by to moscone. also has super fast internet for when you need to get a little work done. highly recommend. :)really good host ! \\r\\ni would recommand them!eric and barb not only have the best place to stay for business or vacation, but they are also the perfect hosts. they are great company if you want it and will leave you be if you prefer that. this place was great. i literally died in that bed everynight. i would i highly recommend staying here!!eric and barb were great hosts, super friendly and accommodating to my needs over the whole week.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room was comfortable, amenities were great and the location is fantastic. highly recommended. eric and barb are amazing host, their place is nice and accessible to sf downtown. cat is cute!although i was kept busy with work throughout my time at eric & barb\\'s place, they went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. it\\'s clear from the moment that you enter the room that barb & eric want to make your stay memorable. they have extra purchasable items for very fair prices and ample amounts of extra blankets. not to mention five different shampoos! one item of note is the intense squishiness of the bed. i sunk into the bed so much that i found myself sleeping on the edges of the bed (funny to think that a softer bed was more difficult for my back). but if you like super squishy beds, this place is for you! thank you eric and barb for everything. we loved to stay at yours :) the room and the bath were very clean. it\\'s all exactly like on the pictures. barb showed us some details on a map (busstation...) that helped us a lot cause in san francisco was our first destination in the usa. they were both very friendly. i can just recomment their accomodation.had a great stay here! would def recommend and will be coming back for sure!my 1.5 weeks here were one of my best airbnb stays ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is a cat in the apartment who will usually stay out of the room, and in fact i had to actively coax pigeon to come into the room. i have 6 cats (and a dog!) and missed them tremendously, having been on the road for a week before i got here. so having pigeon around was perfect, and i was very happy to see a friendly cat who loved being petted and scratched. the icing was when the hosts were both away over the weekend and pigeon was obviously lonely and missed human company, and so i managed to get pigeon to spend the night with me on the bed! but again -- if you don\\'t want the cat in the room, she will not come in and it is very easy to ensure that she will not get in.\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise, the room was comfortable, with a super comfy bed, directv+netflix, a very well equipped room, and a spacious bathroom. the location of the listing was also perfect for my needs. barb and eric were great hosts, very personable and i had great chats with both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only thing i would flag, is that because of how the room is set-up, there is \"visual\" privacy (nobody can see what you do), but there is limited \"audio\" privacy (the hosts can hear the sounds in your room, and vice versa).\\r\\n\\r\\nwill definitely stay again!i was in sf for a conference at the moscone center and eric and barb\\'s place was perfect.  i didn\\'t actually meet barb because she was out of town during my stay, but eric was a great host.  gave me lots of great food recommendations in the area.  the room was lovely, just as described.  i very much enjoyed my stay and would certainly stay again!i stayed 4 days in the room and it was really great ! everything you need is present in the rom and eric and bard are really nice hosts (advices on the city, ...). the room is located near many touristic point so it\\'s really easy to go everywhere pretty quickly. \\r\\ni\\'ll recommend that room to anyone who want to stay in sf ! i had 5 relaxing days in this very comfortable room at eric and barb. it felt clean, and the bathroom was modern with good standard. i find the add very accurate. and already being prepared for the room not being soundproof, the sounds from the rest of the apartment never disturbed me. (i hope i did`nt disturb them). eric and barb answered my texts before my arrival and during my stay fast and helpful.me and my wife had a wonderful 6 days stay with eric and barb. the room is really as described and chockful of amenities and extras which will delight even the most fussy traveller. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe only problem is the late 5pm check-in which may foil first day plans or jet lagged travellers but that\\'s just a minor issue. \\r\\n\\r\\notherwise a 5 star stay!!!this was my second time staying in this listing, so obviously it\\'s a good experience staying here. again, the thing i love most about this listing is the cat -- pigeon is simply so adorable! i have 6 cats at home so i do miss them a lot when i travel (esp for almost 2 weeks as with this trip), and having pigeon around made me happy. to be clear, the hosts -- and pigeon herself -- are very good about the cat not coming into the room, and i had to strongly encourage pigeon to come in before she would.\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise, the room was clean, comfortable, had a spacious attached bathroom, has a tv with directv and netflix so there\\'s tons of stuff to watch, and has space for my luggage and clothes etc. the location in soma was great for my purposes. i would definitely stay here again.very nice room like a luxury hotel.  my very late arrival and communication around it was handled very well.  great eating option very close by. very nice and highly recommend i stayed with eric and barb for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. the room is fully equipped as the listing states and had every necessary toiletry that i could think of! there\\'s a nice big tv with cable, a coffee machine, microwave, refrigerator and plenty of drawer space for clothes, etc.. if there was one downside to such a well equipped room, it was that i found i had difficulty finding an open space to charge my electronic devices such as laptop and portable gaming consoles.\\r\\nthe room is well located in soma, has good transit nearby and is within walking distance from the main downtown areas such as market st and union square.eric and barb\\'s place was great. plenty of amenities just like a hotel (down to the mini bar and in-suite k-cup coffee maker). the place is in the middle of soma near a bunch of the tech headquarters and popular places to eat. i was in town for airbnb open and most of the events were on the other side of town so i didn\\'t get to spend much time around the place or the neighborhood as a whole. one thing i do know is that on my next trip to sf, i\\'m definitely checking to see if they\\'re available because i very enjoyed eric\\'s hospitality.wonderful host.  very pleasant and professional.  kept great communication.  would highly recommend this place, it was very enjoyable.eric & barb were wonderful hosts and very welcoming. they were very flexible and made sure to accommodate my travel schedules. i would definitely recommend them! comfortable bed, cozy room, new and clean bathroom.  loved it!this was my first airbnb experience and i was really pleased with how it worked out. eric and barb were great to work with in getting it all set up and were very accommodating for little things like providing a blender, making sure i had ice, that sort of thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe bedroom and bathroom are exactly like in the pictures. all very comfy and felt very homey. and all those channels on the big screen tv, who could ask for anything else? :-)\\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely stay with eric and barb again.this was my second time this year staying here. great and convenient as always! eric and barb were also very accommodating of my late arrival. thanks guys!very comfortable stay. eric & barb were very welcoming and the bed itself was one of the most comfortable i\\'ve ever slept on! mini bar treats were also very convenient and reasonable and as a non cat person i have to admit i was won over by this one!interesting place! eric and barb have created a pretty high-end hotel room in the middle of their apartment! very tastefully decorated, super-clean, nice private bathroom and very comfortable bed. and the  in-room snack bar and stocked mini-fridge were very welcome after a long day! (otoh, a basket full of snacks can be detrimental to your health.) \\r\\n\\r\\ni was busy while in sf and interacted only a bit with eric, and not ant all with barb. but all our communications before and during the stay were easy quick. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe only downside of this room is that sound transmits through the apartment quite a lot. barb and eric were fantastic hosts. i was greeted by barb upon my arrival, we had a great conversation, and the room was very comfortable. the stocked fridge, snacks and other amenities were a nice touch and the private restroom really helped make my stay a calm one. pigeon was also quite adorable. what a fantastic stay.  eric and barb are great hosts and the room was perfect. internet speed was nothing short of awesome, and i was able to get a lot of work done in the evenings.  i had my own private bathroom and did not feel like my privacy, or theirs, was an issue at all.  \\r\\n\\r\\nas a bonus, barb and i went out for a great walk and got to see the neighborhood; that was a great ending to a few very productive days in san francisco.this is my third time staying here, and it\\'s as good as before -- clean, comfortable and conveniently-located. and of course the resident cat pigeon is as friendly and adorable as always (non-cat-lovers don\\'t worry, pigeon will not come into your room if you don\\'t her to). eric & barb have added a table since i was last here which turned out to be a very good improvement. they were also super accommodating when i arrived an hour earlier than expected.\\r\\n\\r\\notherwise, just note that sound travels in this room, but it was not a bother or issue for me at all.the hosts were very friendly and helpful when i had any questions. the room was nice - clean and nicely decorated and as pictured, with a super entertainment setup. as others have mentioned, sound travels in the apartment, but i found it fine to sleep in.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was quiet and very handy too. i could walk to moscone center in about 20-25 minutes. while there are no shops in the immediate vicinity, it\\'s a quick enough walk to the caltrain station and some nice surrounding cafes and bars. near the caltrain, the creamery and iron cactus were good. it\\'s not immediately obvious, but they are attached and you can actually sit out the back of iron cactus, it\\'s a good work environment if the weather is good as they have free wifi. also recommended are epicenter (also with free wifi), whole foods, and (in the other area) live sushi bistro.eric & barb have been very friendly and accommodating from the point we arrive, check in and depart. the place is clean and they do provide all the necessary toiletries for use. they are also very flexible, and we were appreciative of the fact that they allowed us late check out due to our late flights.this stay was for one of my companies employees. he was very happy with his trip. great location.   15 minute walk from moscone center and att park.  whole foods that serves a great selection of beer 10 minutes away as is a starbucks.  room is stocked with lots of snacks, waters, microwave, keurig.  private bathroom and being right off the door is perfect.  the neighborhood is up and coming.barb was attentive upon arrival,  i had no problems checking in. room and amenities were as described - stocked with lots of beverages and snacks. everything was clean and organized. sound does travel in the apartment, but it was not disruptive to me stay. thanks for a great week!very disappointed from start to finish!  as a frequent business traveler, i have stayed in thousands of places around the globe.  i am sorry to report that this stay will be on the top 10 list of horrible experiences.  this was my first time booking through air bnb as a result of a last minute business trip to sf.  most of the hotels were completely booked and i thought i would try this option.  as a result of this stay, it will probably be my last.  lowlights of my 3 day experience (note that i was out of the room from 7 am-9:30 pm each day - #3 put me over the top):\\r\\n1. \"checking in\" not easy - rules say check in at 5 pm.  i flew into sf very early the 1st day and was in meetings till 7 pm.  unfortunately, hosts were out and couldn\\'t be back till 9 pm.  after waking up at 2 am, this was a little inconvenient. \\r\\n2. after check-in, i crashed in the very soft bed (i don\\'t prefer soft beds, but was too tired to care).  although i fell asleep quickly, it was interrupted by the constant chirping of the smoke detector\\'s battery.  bad luck, maybe.\\r\\n3. it got worse on the 2nd night.  after being gone from 7:00 am and a full day of meetings, i came back to the room at 10:00 pm.  exhausted, i quickly fell asleep but again my sleep was interrupted by some thumping sounds that i thought was music by some neighbor.  i got out of bed at 3:30 am to realize that some sort of music was being played in the other room!  i was too tired to put clothes on and go into a stranger\\'s house to ask tell them that their music was disturbing my sleep.  but, why would someone even need to complain about something like this??  it is hard to describe what was going on but it sounded as though someone was testing or composing different instruments.  i was completely shocked that someone would be playing or composing music all night long.  i sent them a text message at 4:15 am but it did not stop!  \\r\\nafter spending $250/night for this room, i was expecting a bit more - or at least a good night sleep\\r\\ni respect the fact that everyone is different and have habits which i may not agree with.  but, after reading the hosts describe the room as an oasis for sleep, i have to strongly disagree.   beware!!eric and barb was a wonderful host, had a great time talking to both of them. barb was quite accommodating to my arrival time, even though she was in a rush, she stayed until i arrived and make sure i checkin properly. the room was clean and tidy, it had all the amenities described, it\\'s the best i have experienced so far. there may be some lights or sounds outside the room during the night but that does not effect me much, i slept well. they were also quite nice to let me leave my luggage at the doorway so that i can pick it up later for my evening flight. pigeon was always there to welcome me home and send me out of the house.the hosts greeted me when i arrived.  the room was as advertised.  big screen tv, nice bed, large bathroom.  the space was quite functional.  i used the desk and the iron and iron board was a nice added touch.  i was able to walk to the office.  i enjoyed my stay.eric and barb were great hosts! the room was as advertised, very clean, with a beautiful tv. the bathroom is separate, with a lock between the room and the door, providing extra security.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bed was so comfortable that i fell asleep with book in hand, pretty soon after i laid down. you can hear some noises from inside of the house, but you\\'d be hard-pressed to really hear anything particular other than eric and barb shuffling through the apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\npigeon the cat greeted me when i came in, but as they promised, never entered my room.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this was a fantastic stay! i will stay there the next time i visit, if it\\'s available. highly recommended.was great.eric was very friendly and helpful. i was busy during my conference so we didn\\'t get to interact much but he went out of his way to make sure my stay was pleasant. pigeon is also one of the cutest cats i\\'ve ever seen.i stayed there for 10 days. eric and barbra are great hosts. the room (with own bathroom) was nice, spacious and clean. the neighborhood is quite nice too. it\\'s very close to caltrain and many big tech companies in soma. don\\'t hesitate to book it!my father and i stayed at eric and barb\\'s place. \\r\\neric and barb were very helpful and were present when we arrived. they helped us settle in.  pigeon their cat was well behaved and adorable. \\r\\nit was convenient stay for us.eric and barb were great, made me feel really welcome and showed me around the area. best airbnb hosts i\\'ve had.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room was a good size with a big tv and a really comfortable bed. there\\'s your own bathroom next door too.\\r\\n\\r\\nfound some good bars and places to eat in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks!the host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this place is awesome. just outside the city with amazing views. bob has spent decades carefully adding pieces to his place. very tastefully decorated. always clean. very relaxing. home away from home. beautiful!  pictures do not do this immaculate property justice.  bob is very accommodating, truly an excellent host.lovely, immaculately kept home!  the views from bob\\'s home are stunning, especially at night.  we enjoyed just sitting and taking it all in after we\\'d come home for the night!\\r\\nbob was a delight, had coffee ready for us in the morning and was very accommodating and approachable.  bed was very comfortable, area quiet, safe, and with easy parking.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommend.bob was a super host...very friendly, relaxed, and also gave great advice about places to visit in the area. the place was gorgeous and very clean and decorated in excellent taste. recommended.bob is a wonderful host! charming, classy and friendly. i enjoyed staying at his flat. bob\\'s place is fabulous, located on top of diamond heights, it gets the bird eye view of the whole san francisco, and it\\'s convenient to get to other parts of city, easy to find parking places, and supermarket and post office are just around the corner.\\n\\nit\\'s a pity that bob is out of town, so we didn\\'t get a chance to meet him personally, yet bob arranged everything for us to ensure a smooth and comfortable stay. bob\\'s friend michael has been a great help to us, offering advices throughout the city and we get along quite well during our stay.\\n\\nhope we can stay longer next time, in bob\\'s lovely place in unique city of san francisco.we were waiting for enter our new home in san francisco and had to find a temporary place for our family. bob\\'s house was a wonderful find. very well located for commuters, 3 minutes away from the grocery store, and in a very quiet neighborhood. bob\\'s taste for mid-century made us felt in a museum. i worked very comfortably from his living room and office. his kitchen is super equipped for home cooking , state of the art appliances and chef pans. but the best is...bob himself ! very warm host, respectful of our privacy. we have enjoyed chatting with him every evening. sadly we only met bob for a few minutes before we left, but we had a fabulous stay in this amazing house. great art on the walls, immaculate and well appointed and a spectacular view that photos just can\\'t do justice to. we really felt \\'at home\\'.just watch the parking on alternate thursdays.amazing place , with such a nice view !\\r\\nlocation is very good \\r\\nbob is a very good host who has a lot of intentions for his guestsbob was an amazing host! he was very helpful and friendly. i felt as if i had known him for the longest time. his house is very beautiful and it has a great view of the city. the bedroom is very comfortable and private. over all it was a great experience and i will most definitely stay at bobs again. it is no wonder why bob is a superhost; his home is spectacular, communication is excellent, and his hospitality and personality are exceptional.  the 20 min drive from downtown was rewarded with an unparalleled view of the city in quiet comfort.  bob accepted a change in my plans unquestionably.  i would look forward to meeting bob again and already miss his unique home and magical view.bob\\'s apartment was beautiful! seriously fantastic design and view! bob himself was an accommodating host, we checked in later than expected but this was not an issue. our bedroom was clean, comfy and although we didn\\'t really spend too much time in the apartment (we were out in the city) it was an enjoyable experience. the only minor downside was that it wasn\\'t right in the heart of the city, but we knew this before booking. plus his area was super safe and did i already mention the view?!? incredible. bob is a super host on airbnb for a reason, so we felt in good hands. bob\\'s house was fantastic! exactly how it was described in his listing but better. the view was stunning and the house itself was a time warp to the 60s. the best airbnb i have ever (email hidden)municating with bob was great. although we would have loved meeting him, he emailed us with careful instructions on how to enter and exit the house. highly highly recommended. bob is a great host. he made me feel welcome and at home from the first moment. his apartment is spacious and very nice, the views over san fran downtown and the bay area are stunning.mathew\\'s place is easily accessible from the train. it is indeed walking distance to the beach and is a very quiet, peaceful neighborhood. mathew was very helpful in telling me about the city, the ocean and pretty much anything i wanted to know about the area.matt was a terrific host!  i greatly appreciated him finding a bike for me to rent and he and the other guests were all a delight to get to know.   i loved being a block from the beach and a few blocks from the wonderful java beach cafe, a community center as well as a coffee shop.great location. \\ngreat host. \\ngreat city. great place, especially if you\\'re traveling alone, get the futon. met some real cool people, it was like a real more intimate hostelnice, relaxed beach vibe which is still easy access to the city.\\r\\nliterally just over a block to ocean bch. i took a wetsuit and they lent me a board to hit the water. \\r\\neverything is clean, there are easy to follow instructions and everything works!\\r\\nthe transport was nearby, there are parks, a good couple of cafés and restaurants and this was all pointed out by matt.\\r\\nthe area feels safe and friendly with neighbours saying hello.\\r\\ni will definitely returngreat place, great location, great host\\r\\ngreat, clean space in a cool location. matthew was super accommodating and friendly. would definitely recommend!neighborhood:\\r\\nthe place is exactly as mentioned; in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood just a block from the beach. commute is super easy and close by with muni bus station just one block and muni metro station three blocks away. some grocery stores and local cafes are located nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space:\\r\\nthe futon is pretty comfortable and big enough for one person. there are several windows in the living room for a cool breeze as it gets hot in there sometimes and there\\'s no ac. \\r\\n\\r\\ncouple things to keep in mind though:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. you are essentially sleeping right next to the door so guests coming in and going out might bother you a bit specially if they have late night arrivals. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. since it\\'s a living room space, there is no closet or storage space to put your luggage in. its basically just lying there by the fireplace in the living room. i pretty much lived out of my bag for a week. matt did offer me to put it in the laundry room but that is more sort of shared and often occupied space as its within the bathroom. plus the shelves were always overflowing with fresh and used laundry which wouldn\\'t leave you with much space anyways.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. the entire space including the living room, kitchen, bathroom and the laundry room could use some serious dusting and cleaning. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe host:\\r\\nmatt is very friendly. he would love to chat with you when he\\'s around. you can have long conversations with him about changing the internet while trying some of his homemade sauerkraut. that tasted really good btw. he also gave me some tips about commuting safely in the city which really came in handy.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would give it a 3.5/5 stars.i don\\'t mind to live in the living room but include kitchen. the bed is near the door that people come in and go out. some people cooked in the early morning and some of them came back in the lated night. i can\\'t sleep very well. bed is comfortable. if you want some place that quiet and close to the beach, i \\'d recommend. staying with matthew was the perfect beginning to my stay in san francisco.  he was a thoughtful, entertaining host.  my bed was beautiful and extremely comfortable and i woke up as the was rising over the city- a beautiful view.  staying in the house was like stepping back in time.  i will always treasure my time spent in the company of the grand old house and it\\'s talented, warm owner.  thank you, mike.matt is such a fun guy with insights and great passion for surfing! i enjoyed the stay at his place and the long catch-up on the first day we met. the location is at ocean beach - only two blocks away from the beach. therefore, the commute to downtown / union sq. is a little bit time consuming. one thing that impressed me a lot is how neat and well organized matt\\'s place is!my time with matthew was excellent. he\\'s a really interesting guy and someone to have fascinating conversations with. matthew was very welcoming and flexible with check-in and leaving time. everything was clearly communicated prior to my arrival and i had no problems finding the place. the location is perfect for those that want something a bit quieter. the listing was exactly as i expected, clean, spacious and the curtains around the futon are an excellent addition, definitely adding privacy to the stay. the futon is comfortable with plenty of room for one person but there\\'s not much room for luggage. so this listing is probably best for someone travelling alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere\\'s usually other travellers in the place, which is a unique feature that makes it a really interesting place to stay. it was very quiet after hours too, so everyone could get a good night\\'s sleep and the footfall near the futon didn\\'t mind me one bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nsan francisco is a great city and while this listing seems far from the city centre, it\\'s super easy to get public transport to anywhere in the city and it\\'s very cheap, it takes less than an hour on the muni to the other side of the city. i am glad i stayed in this listing, i much preferred staying with matthew and catching public transport than staying somewhere closer to the city centre. this place is right at the end of the n-judah line so public transport is readily accessible.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would really recommend this listing. you\\'ll have a great time!matthew is very friendly and helpfull. we could use the bikes as well the surfboards. was there with my son (12).\\nas i made a quick booking, did not realize that  we have to sleep in the livingroom and kitchen which is used from many people, as there are three bedroom plus our futon in the livingroom and also you have to sleep besides the entrydoor (sometimes highly frequented) to the appartement, bed is \"separated\" by a curtain. apartment looks on the picture more tidy as it was and could need some deep cleaning. \\ntotally i were not satisfied, compared with the costvalue (two nights/two persons/ 280 $) but this was also my problem as i did not read the airbnb announce and review properly. great place. matthew was away but his housemate rob was around instead. rob was awesome telling me all the spots, helping me with surfboards, bikes etc., even took me to the bakery. even though the futon was in the living room, the other guests were very respectful and i slept like a log. highly recommended.this ocean beach apartment is really easy-going and just one block from the sea. perfect for a short stay if you want to surf, since matt has many boards that you can use for free. being able to rent bikes is also very convenient. i would however recommend to get a room, if available, and not the sofa, as it is not the most comfortable thing to sleep on (there is a very hard section right in the middle), and not waking up when less considerate guests come home in the middle of the night is hardly possible. that said, i highly recommend the apartment in general as well as the host (who was not there, but his flatmate rob was very helpful).\\r\\nit was so nice to stay in matthew\\'s house. we can relax here. close to the ocean beach and bus stop, so we can enjoy staying in sf!the location of marrhews place was really great! close to transportation and some good restaurents. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was okay to sleep on the futon in the livingroom, though a little bit noisy sometimes.. the house is great ! very good location to visit both gold hate park and the (url hidden) is a pity mr.matthew wasn\\'t at home when i was iiving , but his friend rob was very nice and helpful! he help me checked in and explained everything to me . the house has surfing board and guitars, i also rent his bicycle to visit the park and downtown! next time when i come back i wish could try surfing and learn from matthew:) highly recommend his house:) matt\\'s place is pretty neat and well maintained. while there might not be human contact, but he has made sure that the guests are comfortable by meticulously labelling everything around and has left detailed instructions for everything.\\r\\nthe only challenge is that it is slightly far from the city centre - but the upside is that it is extremely well connected by muni. would recommend staying here if you are looking for some sanity in this insane city.\\r\\njust one word of advice - if you are staying in one of the rooms, then please do not lock them, they do not have a key.we really enjoyed staying here. it is in really safe neighbourhood and the ocean is one block away. matthew is an awesome host, place was very clean and comfy so we really felt like home.this is my first airbnb stay for 2 nights!\\ni could say that it was a wonderful experience, when you can meet different nationalies guest. \\ni\\'ve stay in the easy room, basically is a sofa bed in the living room with curtains installed if you want privacy.\\nthe apartment has basically all the basic needs!\\nthe bike rental is cheaper than rental at sf. \\ni had cycled from fisherman wharf to golden gate bridge and the other piers.\\nalthough i didn\\'t met in person with the host, as he\\'s traveling but we kept in contact via airbnb msg.\\nit is a good place to stay if you like living close to the beach in sf !really great location and super easy instructions for arrival and departure! would recommend and stay there again!matt was very friendly and made the entire trip a breeze!  the listing was quite accurate and the location was beach goers dream!  i would stay again! :]nice place to stay!everything was awesome. everything was labeled so i didnt have any questions. and the location was amazing. nice place , friendly host , great location :) matts plac was great. wasn\\'t there too long. couldn\\'t sleep had a bad cough and asthma acting up. up all night filling out a zoc doc  account. woke up at 7 and went to the doctors. all in all a nice set up. hope i didn\\'t bother the others too bad with all my coughing.awesome place to stay matt was very nice ans informative! my friend and i had an awesome time staying on the futon we still had privacy and warmth! will most definitely be back my experience there was really good. matt is a really nice person. the futon was really good and although its located on the living room the curtains helps us with some privacy.great place ! and the host is very nice!this hotel is close to the beach. good cafe was close to it. \\nthe room was clean and comfortable. matthew is very friendly. it was very helpful for us to let us use laundry detergent.matthew and i had an interesting conversation. we shared the apartment with a couple from china and another from baltimore.  i enjoy meeting different people.i was nervous that staying in a living room would be a tad awkward, but it was actually great. i had enough room even with the curtains drawn and all the other guests in the home were respectful. matt was great company and an amazing host. had an amazing time talking to him and he was very helpful with letting us know the things to do in the city. the neighborhood is a good one but a bit far off from the main city, there are trains and buses that run there frequently so it\\'s no trouble. the house is perfect and full with other guests to meet and interact with. would come back to his place next time i\\'m in sf as well.tidy house, gracious host, and two blocks away from a most gorgeous beach.\\r\\nwonderful host, had very detailed instructions and labels everywhere to make it easy to help yourself. was also quick to respond to messages if you had any questions. a+ experience and awesome location. it was a clean and safe place; both of which are very crucial. \\nthe location was also a plus- it\\'s a two minute walk to the beach, and a 9 minute walk to the muni station.\\n\\ni recommend it. the \"easy\" option is great if you don\\'t need a lot frills. great experience.well, just like the listing suggested, my stay here was super easy. matt makes everything simple for you. if you\\'re looking to save a bit of $ and be out of the madness of the city, i highly recommend matt\\'s place. it had everything i needed, including a blender and i was able to do my laundry. there are also some really cute restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood. will definitely be staying here next time i\\'m in the city. matthew was an awesome host! very friendly and very helpful. during our stay one of the other guests\\' car got towed very early in the morning but matt helped the guest out regardless, letting them know where to go and what to do. \\r\\nthe actual house is in a quiet neighborhood a block away from the beach. also close to golden gate park and lands end trail. \\r\\noverall a wonderful first airbnb experience for me! interesting guy and cool place. has everything you need and easy parking. nice home in a good location, although i had not met matthew, but everything was organize well.very friendly host. great surfer mat is a fantastic individual to have a meaningful conversation with. he is absolutely a cut above your average guy. i enjoyed the laid back atmosphere of this apartment near the beach and away from the bustle of the city center.very great experience with matthew ! the place is just perfect and matthew is a very nice guy ! if we had to find a place in sf, we\\'ll come back to his house ;) ! \\r\\nthank you for everything ! i was mislead the entire stay at the easy. on the info it states the golden gate bridge was a few blocks away but it took me and the other person 2 hours to bike to it. more than four people were living at the house; which we were not aware of.  my wife and i only stayed at matt\\'s place for one night which we got by making a quick - booking.  everything was as according to the description. the futon in the kitchen/living room is probably a good option for a solo traveller, as the setup doesn\\'t leave much room for privacy. i only spoke with matt briefly because we were tied up for the night, but for the short time we spoke he seemed as a nice guy with a open personality.i had two really good nights at matts place. everything is as said. it\\' a busy house with several guests, but everything works really fine. good bed. nice and clean bathroom. good value. and a really nice and quiet local area. \\nhave your breakfast at devil\\'s teeth, great food and great people.\\nthanks matt, for the advice on buying the car, it was very helpful! the listing was accurate and the matthew was very welcoming!\\r\\ni had a lovely stay!perfect place to stay. i recommend it to anyone in the area. my experience at matt\\'s location was convenient and easy!  matt was a great host, he replied to me quickly and pretty much saved me cause there was a huge convention in town and all hotel rooms were booked.  if your looking for something affordable and just need a place to rest i suggest you stay here!  the futon is very comfortable; it has a layer of padding and plenty of pillows. the house is within walking distance to some great restaurants and the beach. matthew has all around good vibes and is full of helpful information. highly recommend!matthew\\'s place was perfect for our stay. everything was exactly as listed and more. he was super friendly and helpful. the location was amazing, right down the street from the beach and great cafés/resturaunts. parking was easy which was a relief. i was a little worried about staying in a livingroom with other guests staying in other rooms but we had plenty of privacy with the curtains in the morning. i would most definitely stay here again!matt has a nice house by the sea, the neighbor is nice and quiet. it is a two minute walk to the ocean. the house is well labeled and laid out. there were two other groups staying, which allowed us to interact with other airbnb travelers. the pull out was great for our needs of a one-night couch surf.i would recommend this place! everything was as described, communication was very easy. the house is very clean. \\r\\nif you don\\'t mind going to sleep with the last guest and waking up with the first one, staying in the living room is a good and affordable option. we had some good conversations with matthew and other guests and enjoyed our stay in sf :)matthew was an amazing host, after staying at other airbnbs, i can confidently say that he has one of the most accessible and well equipped kitchens even offering \\'free\\' items like coffee and wine for guest to enjoy wonderful experience staying here with my sister! the place was clean and comfortable and even in the futon room the curtains provided enough privacy. the house is easy to access with public transportation and matt sent a very helpful and detailed welcome email with information. great experience! matt has everything prepared in the house for everybody to be comfortable.great guy great bedmy friend and i had a wonderful experience staying with matthew! i think we would stay a little bit closer to the heart of the city on our next trip to san francisco, but it was lovely being so close to the ocean. our accommodations were very comfortable and matthew was super friendly and helpful. we would recommend matthew to anyone. nice stay. like the beach there!great house!matthew was very welcoming and knew tons about the city. will stay here again! i had a great experience! matt is a super nice guy, who really cares about anyone who comes in. really chill and really smart haha. he provided great communication and the description on his page was accurate.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe futon was comfy, i slept well. the curtains provide privacy. everything was really clean. \\r\\n\\r\\ni rented the bike for only $10, there\\'s so many great places to ride too and see. i also borrowed his beginner surfboard for free! he gave me some tips on how and where to go.  we just needed to take nap for two hrs but it appeared clean and reasonable ! \\nclear instructions were in email and parking was no hassle , thanks so much ☺️clean and nice apartment with access to everything that you need! matthew is a great guy and very informative, and you can really make yourself feel at home! even though you sleep in the common area, it feels private since you can pull curtains around the bed. highly recommend matthews apartment as a place to stay!i have to say there are two great things for matthew\\'s room. firstly, the location is next to the beach(2 minutes walk). we had a wonderful jogging alone the beach at morning. secondly, matthew builds detailed rules and instructions for all guests to keep them know how to behave without much oral communication with host. that can help to keep things simple and effective. but i have to say it\\'s not that good to sleep in the living room. we are disturbed by other guests though they didn\\'t mean to.  the place is a little bit overcrowded.staying here, overall, was a good experience - we were able to make full use of the kitchen to cook and laundry, too. i think it\\'s important to note the lack of privacy, though - the curtain does help but doesn\\'t eliminate sound, and there were often people up till early hours of the morning. earplugs are provided but maybe bring some better ones if you really want a good night\\'s sleep. it wasn\\'t incredibly comfortable but good enough for a couple of days, and still great value. the location isn\\'t in the city but is great for exploring other areas of san francisco, and transport links are great. matthiew\\'s appartment is very nice, clean and well equipted! we slept on the futon and it was really comfortable! we really enjoyed the bikes. we recommend this place!! matthew is such a helpful and friendly host. his place is set up for comfort and also set up to promote travelers to go out and soak up as much of the culture and activities in the area. real comfy beds & everything you need is provided! great location with free parking. easy access to the house. made everything convenient to get to. great stay. definitely recommend good stay overall. parking was readily available. privacy was fine with curtain but lucky with other guests being very quite and i was the last to go to sleep and first to rise. noise could be an issue otherwise. our stay was located near the beach and nearby the n light rail line into downtown. the room offers limited privacy, especially from curious guests. the kitchen provides a lot of value for cooking meals at home.we were in the \"easy\" room and the curtain provided enough privacy for us two girls. matt was an amazing host and he is a great guy! take advantage of the bikes provided, they were so much fun! next time i am in the city i will be booking with matt again!matthew was waiting for us upon our arrival where he made us feel welcomed and excited to be in his city. the beach house was just as described and even though my friend and i stayed in the common area, the futon was roomy, comfortable and the curtains gave us a sense of privacy. the other guests were mindful of our presence there and didn\\'t cause much noise while we slept. we felt safe in the neighborhood and everything was within a couple blocks from the fresh produce market to the beach shore. the house was very clean and well kept, and in a decent location to downtown sf. matthew was very polite to us during our stay and would recommend for anyone looking for a relatively cheap place to stay.it was such a pleasant surprise to see how well organised and easy you can access to the apartment and use it. matt is very nice person and will make your stay a great experience. the location is great! just 1 block away from the beach.everything is just like is described and even though the apartment is not near the principal touristic places to go, the public transportation is the best. we couldn\\'t meet matthew but maria the person who helps cleaning is very nice and gave us the best advices. thanks matthew for everything.felt like a communal environment.  just a bunch of people sharing a space.\\r\\n\\r\\nit worked for me as i only needed to crash a couple hours for an early flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nread the description carefully.  the bed is a futon in the kitchen with a curtain around it.really great place to stay with some great food and the beach close by. the \\'futon\\' is a full on super-comfy double bed!\\r\\nloads of advice available on things to do and where to eat, we had a great time!good space in a well run home.  definitely staying in a shared space, but matthew took all the steps necessary to make the stay a convenient and enjoyable one.very nice flatshevi was a great host - very easy to deal with! we loved the location of the apt - great views of the city and walking distance to both noe valley restaurants/whole foods and the castro and muni station.  doloros park is also very close and so is the mission.  the apt is very bright and open with excellent music collection. ideal if you are looking for a high quality place in a great location.great house.  stylish, modern decor and excellent views of the city from the master.  quiet neighborhood with good restaurants and basic needs shopping nearby.  shevi was a good host in helping us make a decision on lodging and responsive even though on vacation travel herself.  with current sleeping arrangements, the house is well suited for a couple with two kids.  we tried to get two couples and two kids and that may have been a little much.shevi\\'s house is beautiful with a family oriented, open design layout. the light in her home is gorgeous, it was a pleasure waking up in her house every morning.very nice house in great location. master bedroom has open air design with common areas of house and thus may be noisy with large groups. host responds promptly to all communication, and organizes arrival entry and departure exit well.the house was fantastic and shevi was a great host.  everything was as advertised, shevi responded promptly to questions and we had a fantastic stay!what an amazing experience!  we just spent a week in this beautiful modern home with our two children while visiting our family in san francisco and we couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.  the house was immaculate, the views were gorgeous, and shevi was an incredible host.  we look forward to being able to return again in the future!  thank you shevi!we had a wonderful stay in san fran at shevi\\'s place.  shevi was a great host and her place was perfect.  we would definitely stay there again.\\r\\n\\r\\njuliebeautiful house in a great san francisco location, with beautiful views over the city. beautiful home…great views, spacious living area with kitchen & living room.  master bedroom had amazing views of san francisco.  loved the high ceilings, clean look of house.  would definitely stay here again.  great location, nice neighborhood.  shevi is an excellent host - responds quickly and is very helpful.we absolutely loved this house! the views are spectacular and the backyard is perfect for a city escape. shevi is quick to respond to any questions and a perfect host. i plan on using airbnb and (hopefully) staying at shevi\\'s house many more times. we loved this place! the house is gorgeous and located in a nice neighborhood. i love how it\\'s close to restaurants and stores. it\\'s a perfect size for 6 people. shevi was a great host, she was very responsive to all our questions. an unmatched airbnb experience in san francisco - me and a few business partners rented shevi\\'s house for a weekend work retreat and bootcamp. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe set up our laptops around the beautiful wooden table for a relaxing and comfortable work environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is a marvel in architecture and interior design. the large floor-to-ceiling windows pour in natural light. the fixtures are selected with great taste. there\\'s a great view from the living room level but if you go up stairs, it\\'s even more epic. \\r\\n\\r\\nat night, the house is just as stunning. there is more recessed lighting than any house i\\'ve ever seen to create perfectly balanced and soft light throughout the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nshevi was very easy to communicate with and the check-in process was a breeze. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was easily the best experience on airbnb i have ever had. although airbnb pads can be found for cheaper, shevi\\'s house is an amazing deal for everything you get, ranging from the comfortable 3 bd/ 3br rooms to its beautiful backyard and hottub. i booked shevi\\'s lovely home for a day offsite with my team. we had the best time and simply fell in love with her home. from the breathtaking view to the charming backyard and hot tub, we were smitten and did not want to leave! thank you shevi for sharing your lovely home! we were 3 persons staying at shevis place for a week. it was a great location, nice and quiet. the house was as beautiful as in the photos :) i really recommend staying here!  this is our first place to stay in san francisco during this trip.\\r\\nit is really a amazing modern views house.\\r\\nyou can see a wonderful city view from the third of main bed room.\\r\\nthe house is very modern and clean.\\r\\nwith many toy, my kids is very love of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring this trip my daughter is keep calling 3937 3937\\r\\nthe street number of the house.\\r\\nshe is miss this house so much.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you ms. she i\\r\\nshevi let us stay in her wonderful house, that is very modern and cosy at the same time. i havn\\'t seen such a wonderful place before, the view is absolutely stunning! every detail in the house is perfect, and all the hints and informations shevi provided us with very very helpful. a great place in a great city! we did not get to meet shevi as she was away, but we loved her house. well situated in a quiet area with ample parking, yet with the trolley bus at the end of the street if you do not want to drive into central sf (parking around pier 39 is around $30). the photos do not do it justice. the main living area of the kitchen, lounge and dining table all open plan on the 1st floor is lovely. the 2nd floor master bedroom and en suite are fabulous, with a great view over the city, however has no separate doorway from the staircase, so not that private. the other two bedrooms were on the ground floor, however a bit disappointing, one just had a mattress on the floor rather than a bed which was not ideal, the other had a couch bed and no blinds at all so we had to use black bin bags as curtains. it was great to have laundry facilities but there was no iron or board. shevi said that she gets her ironing done down the street but we did not look into this. also just so you know (in case you expect it) there was no kettle or toaster (or grill). the hot tub was a real bonus. overall a good stay, well situated.shevi\\'s home is spectacular -- gorgeous views, great open and functional space and friendly host.   we had a wonderful few days there, and hope to have the chance to come back next time we\\'re in sf. \\r\\nvery nice place, just as advertised.  great view.  perfect for us (2 adults, 2 kids).  parking was always available in front.  we didn\\'t spend much time in the immediate neighborhood; maybe next time.the place was amazing. extremely spacious, very modern, and with spectacular views over san francisco. it\\'s a short walk (5-10 mins) to the main street, but the house itself is in a very pleasant and quiet neighborhood. having been to san francisco a few times in the past, this is by far the best place i have stayed. shevi was very helpful and clear with her instructions and itinerary.  we really liked shevi,s house, it was in a great location and views were great and we were happy overall with house and its location...  we would have liked to have had some proper wardrobe space (we are family of six) as we almost had to keep clothes in open suitcase on the floor.  outdoor area with hottub is super nice... overall feeling was we were welcome in her house and just take care of the house no mad list of rules.., however no special amount of cleaning had been done in preparation for our arrival, especially windows with such great views  ... that is not to say house was dirty... upstairs bedroom was great downstairs bedrooms were a bit tight for 4 kids and sleeping arrangements were a little disappointing and not very comfortable, however lots of fun  things for my kids to do and they enjoyed the house... so lots of great things about this house just needs to take care of details..this house was just perfect for the 5 of us (big enough, good location, amazing view, fully equipped, nice interior design, street parking available...).\\r\\nthe neighborhood is really nice, walkable distance to shops and restaurants, metro station.\\r\\nwe enjoyed our stay in this lovely house and shevi was always reachable when needed.the description was accurate.  the neighborhood was perfect.  great for getting anywhere in the city; the bus came right to the end of the street.  perfect.\\r\\nfantastic accommodation!\\r\\nit was so nice to stay here.\\r\\nvery good time with the owners who showed me the good places of the city!\\r\\na marvelous experience to discover this beautiful city!\\r\\nhighly recommended.the reservation was canceled the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.really friendly + quite extraordinary place. a genuine pleasure staying here. thanks!wonderful, unique, comfortable, roomy space and really friendly people. a bike was available, which was a huge convenience for getting around. matt  was a great host.matt was in for a short time only but gave me the grand tour, got me settled in and made me feel welcomed. i stayed for the whole month of august. the room was great, spacious and clean. \\r\\nthe shared space is amazing, full of interesting pieces of furniture. the place has a character of its own and totally fits into the whole mission style. we had a good stay at the mission arts coop.  the bed was very comfortable and the bike that was available was great.  we didn\\'t get to spend too much time with our hosts but they made us feel welcome.  we liked the location, private bathroom, and having our own sitting area to relax.  we like being able to valencia street and delores park.  access to transit was very good and we biked around a lot.  would definitely stay again.the room was much better than what i saw on the picture here. joe is very open and helpful throughout my stay there, and i\\'m enjoying everything there. i would not hesitate to return here and have another stay when i\\'m coming back to san francisco. i would give a 7-star rating if it is possible at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nhe also provides filtered water, hot water, dishes, and almost everything that a traveler needed. all restroom are clean and neat, and some magazines near the loo is always helpful.my visit i sf was af very good experience. it was my first use of airbnb. i felt very welcome and had af good time at the place. felt \"home\". i had af nice room, with my own bath og toilet. i got good information about any quistion. i liked very much to have at bicykle to get around in the neigbourhood, and across the bridge. the neighbourhood i very interesting. good restaurants and musicplaces. you never know what you meet. bee open. you will meet the unexpected. hope to come back.i couldn\\'t have hoped for a better stay while in san francisco.  within moments of arriving, i felt comfortable and entirely at home. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe space is absolutely beautiful.  super clean and well-thought out, with nice natural lighting.  i felt very inspired by the eclectic decorating, gorgeous furniture, and overall vibes.\\r\\n\\r\\ni made a new friend in joe, the gentleman who was running the show at the space.  he\\'s an incredibly rad guy, and made sure i was taken care of from the start.  his chill and helpful demeanor was a perfect addition to the atmosphere of the safehouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, a great time.  i can\\'t wait to go back.great room. high ceilings, comfy bed. easy to uber everywhere. joe is a chill guy. this place is awesome, and everyone was really friendly. the neighborhood has so many places to eat and hang out, and is also close to the bart so you can go downtown and see how much cooler where you are staying is.\\r\\n\\r\\njoe was our host and he was very friendly and made us feel at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you\\'re looking for a place, this is it.great room. very nice people. a fun experience. the area is a bit hard but also super interesting. we never felt unsafe though. joe and queenie were great hosts, lots of nice people in the house.this is definitely one of the best place i stayed at. matt and joe are very nice and welcoming - very available too. the loft has its very own genuine style (i mean, nothing is faked). the room offers much space and is very comfortable - and there\\'s a roof top! very nice place to hang around if you tired running the streets, museums or business meetings. place is well located in a quiet street of mission, not far from cool places (valencia street) or public transportation (buses and bart - direct from the airport). very good stay - highly recommended.great host. felt very welcome. they even offered to throw some wrinkled clothes i\\'d packed into the dryer when i didn\\'t have an iron. really nice space, too.matt was a great host, gifting us (in his own words) with a truly san francisco experience. the place was exactly as described in the pictures - a super original and gorgeous apartment, built over an old warehouse in the mission. the place was very spacious (which is rare in sf) yet very comfy. hot shower and super functional furniture. as the first floor is used for comercial purposes, it was a bit noisy from early morning until early afternoon. not an issue if you are a heavier sleeper like me... although the interior of the place is flawless and super comfortable, the neighbourhood is not recommended for walking alone in the night-time. \\r\\n\\r\\nas a whole, i just loved the experience and would definitely recommend the place and the host for all of my friends. overall, our experience was great.  the room was exactly as described and pictured, and it was in a very convenient location.  even though matt wasn\\'t around during our stay, he gave very detailed instructions as to how to access the building/room, and he and his girlfriend made sure we had everything we needed.  matt\\'s place is inspirational. it\\'s the kind of place you talk about to your friends-- well, i gushed about it to my friends. i really wanted to invite all my friends over. the space is extremely spacious and creative. very friendly people also--matt wasn\\'t in town but he still makes sure you\\'re taken care of. highly recommended- 10/10matt\\'s space is beautifully decorated and caters to dreamers, travelers, those on a wanderlust and anyone who appreciates attention to detail and human interaction.  you quite simply won\\'t find a more inspirational or collaborative environment than the one he\\'s created at safehouse.matt is a one of a kind individual and so is his place. welcoming, characterful and soaked in positive energy. i stayed there for a week, but the experience will stay with me disproportionally longer. no frills (images here represent the vibe but are not up to date) but very soulful. a strong embodiment of airbnb\\'s core spirit. hope i can return when in sf.matt was a great host. the room was really cool- heaps of light and space and was in a great location. there were cafes,bars and restaurants really close by. would definitely stay here again! the host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.unfortunately i did not get to meet ashish as i had to leave earlier than planned but i met ken, one of the other residents of the house. he is a lovely person, gave me a lot of information about the city, openly shared his stories and even offered me a ride with his car. so thanks a lot ken! :) the room i got was beautiful, lots of privacy, its own bathroom and a nice view over san francisco! thanks a lot for everything. this was my first experience using airbnb – having ashish & ken as hosts has made me a believer. in addition to being a warm, engaging couple (i had many an interesting conversation with them) their hospitality enriched my experience in san francisco. they are quick to share their knowledge of the area and the city and even gave me a guest pass to a museum that had an exhibit i wanted to see (you might, also, be interested in visiting the contemporary jewish museum). the dogs are very friendly and well-behaved, overall, as well. \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir house is lovely and convenient to diverse local restaurants & retailers. mass transit is easily accessible, via the muni trains. ashish and ken have a few different lodging options, so one should fit your needs. i was in the master suite, on a futon in the living area. the set-up won\\'t suit everyone\\'s needs, but as a single traveler, it was perfect for me. it was a pleasure waking up to their gorgeous view, overlooking the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you have a chance to dine with them, do so; not only is ashish a great cook, but you will be in good company with him and his friends from the neighborhood. it\\'s a family-style meal and they do a wonderful job of making you feel at home.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, ashish & ken were great hosts that i would happily stay with again.ash and ken are wonderful hosts and very enjoyable to hang out with. their friendliness and warmth made me feel incredibly welcome and comfortable. they epitomize what an airbnb experience should be and is the reason i won\\'t be staying in a hotel ever again. this was my first time using airbnb and ash is the reason i\\'m raving to friends, family, and any acquaintance why this is the only way to experience a new location.\\n\\nthe home is lovely and both the shared and private room for which i had the privilege in staying in (thanks again, ash!) are clean and organized spaces. you\\'ll also love the view from both! \\n\\ni very much enjoyed my time with them and truly wish them both the best that life has to offer because they\\'re good people. if you\\'re visiting san francisco, i highly recommend you do yourself the favor in booking with ash and ken in the castro district. ashish, ken and the two dogs were like a real family to me! my experience in the house was amazing, i have recived love, help, and all that i need. they have invited to dinner, have help with the tickets to alcatraz (impossible to get by myself) and go with him to golden gate by car... very lovely. \\nthe house is really awesome! very big, clean and funny. the views from my room are spectacular, the bath is very big with a fantastic shower. great decoration and best place: the castro st, the best street in sf, very quiet but near of the best clubs in the city. great!!\\nthose days was a fantastic days that i\\'ll never forget, if i return to sf i\\'ll repeat my experience whit them. \\nsorry for my english, i need to express in spanish too:\\n\\nrecomiendo totalmente este hogar a cualquiera que quiera vivir unos días inolvidables en san francisco! los habitantes de la casa, ashish, ken, los dos perros y las chicas japonesas son excelentes personas!! son divertidos, cariñosos, serviciales, distendidos, agradables, y me faltan adjetivos para describirlos. conmigo se han portado como mi propia familia, brindándome cariño y ayuda siempre. incluso me han invitado a cenar con ellos, me han llevado a la playa y al golden gate, e incluso me han conseguido un ticket para visitar alcatraz, cuando era prácticamente imposible. geniales!!! muchas gracias de nuevo, chicos. \\nla casa es inmejorable, muy bonita, decorada con muy buen gusto, limpia, súper agradable. la habitación del futon es la mejor, muy amplia, con unas vistas de la ciudad alucinantes y un gran baño con una ducha deliciosa!!\\nla ubicación perfecta, en la mejor calle de san francisco, castro st. donde se ubica la casa es muy tranquilo pero a un paso está toda la movida de castro, con los clubs más divertidos de la ciudad. muy bien comunicada por metro y tranvías antiguos (muní)\\nnunca visare estos casi cuatro días que he pasado con toda esta gente maravillosa, os lo recomiendo 100%\\nun beso a todosash and ken were great hosts! the futon was like it\\'s pictured, i never had any problems going in/out of the apartment and they always shared their meals with me. i was definitely not a stranger and i felt like i was a part of the house in 3-4 days.ash and ken were wonderful hosts! the first night ash cooked a whole salmon and allowed me to stay for dinner. both of them were very helpful in giving me advice about jobs and connecting me to other, more permanent residences in the area. i also got the opportunity to meet the other occupants in the house; they were all delightful. the room itself is large, has a big screen tv and has a beautiful view of the sf. if you are not a morning person, be sure to bring a sleeping mask as the room is brightly lit up early in the morning. lastly, if you love dogs, there are two adorable ones ready for you to play with :)while my stay was quite short, i had a great time staying with ashish and ken.  they were very gracious hosts, and their home was both beautiful and comfortable.  i would definitely stay with them again.  one quick tip: if you\\'re arriving late at night, you might not notice that the numbers for 240 are obscured by some vines.  it\\'s the same house that is numbered for 238.even though my stay was relatively short, i had a great time staying with both ashish and ken. they were both very friendly and generous and gave me great advice for traveling around san francisco. the two dogs were also very friendly and well behaved. the location was also great for traveling to various parts of the city, especially with such an easy access to the muni. i would definitely recommend their place for anyone traveling to san francisco for whatever reason.  lived with ashish for a week and absolutely enjoyed the stay. the futon was very comfortable and the view as mentioned in the listing is really good. you can sleep in a way so that once you get up the first thing you see is the awesome view. the apartment is very conveniently located. i used to go for work in soma and it took me 20 minutes max to reach from ashish\\'s place to my office door. \\r\\n\\r\\nashish also has really well behaved dogs and it would be a delight for people who like them. i had a fun time playing with them after coming back to his place everyday. i think ashish has trained them well to welcome the guest whenever he is not around. i would definitely recommend ashish\\'s place to everybody.ash is great and so is his place. he\\'s always a generous host and has great stories!\\nrecommend, definitely.ashish and his partner are amazingly accommodating airbnb hosts. they had my room ready 5 minutes after booking, fed me delicious dinner and breakfast and even took me to the airport. the house was clean and spacious and there were great views of the city from the futon. i was welcomed into the home as a fellow house member and very much enjoyed my stay. thanks.  i couldn\\'t have asked for more generous hosts than ash and ken. days before my arrival ash called me to make sure my arrival was coordinated and ask about dietary concerns.  my late night arrival was no inconvenience to them, and everything was clean and ready when i arrived. the view was fantastic and the location very convenient. a couple of nights they had a communal dinner with friends and other guests, a nice perk for a single traveler. i felt like i was staying in a hostel. these are genuine hosts who truly care about people and enriched traveling experiences. i would definitely recommend staying with them!ashish and ken were fantastic hosts. ash was great about communicating logistics before my arrival - ash and ken were out of town the day of my arrival, so i was put in touch with their roommate, who is also wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe futon was very comfortable and the view of sf is amazing from the room. while the room where the futon is located shares a bathroom with the master bedroom, the room is separated from the master bed, so i felt like i had my own space. the house is in an extremely convenient location, particularly if you\\'re looking to explore castro and the mission, but also by using the 24 muni bus (which is a 10 second walk away) or any other public transit located a block away, you can easily get all over the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are two dogs in the house that are a lot of fun and very lovable. i would just be sure you like medium-sized dogs (and aren\\'t allergic) before staying here.\\r\\n\\r\\ni enjoyed a homemade dinner with ash, ken, their roommate, and some of their friends one of the two nights i stayed - i was immediately welcomed by the group and felt completely at ease. ken also made breakfast one morning and talked with me about fun places to visit in the city. they were so generous, not only with their space, but also socially and personally.\\r\\n\\r\\nstaying with ash and ken was much more than simply place to sleep - it was a chance to get to meet interesting and kind people, and also receive some great tips about sf. this was my first time using airbnb - it was an overwhelmingly positive experience!excellent hosts. super friendly, made me feel right at home. shared a few meals together, gave me solid advice on what to do around town, and were overall very accommodating. they live in a beautiful area with lots to do and it\\'s easy to get around town from there. would book again in a heartbeat! i would classify their attitude as \"our home is your home\". exceptional and awesome hospitality. they are amazing. booked the room super last minute and they let me in when they weren\\'t home really trusting. cooked breakfast in the am and left chocolates on my bed!! they are really a great example of how a host home should be!! would highly recommend a stay here they are lovely peoplewonderful experience! i have never booked a roof over my head with airbnb before but, boy, am i glad i did. ashish and ken welcomed me in their beautiful home with open arms. their futon was comfortable, the view was breathtaking, the room cozy and homely, with an extra-extra large smart hdtv. they made me feel safe and part of. they were courteous, trusting and super nice. they fed me (delicious frittata, ken), made me tea (how refreshing, ashish), introduced  me to new friends and made sure i had everything i needed to make my stay most enjoyable. we conversed, we laughed, i even got to walk their handsome dog paul in the castro neighborhood (great location). i came to san francisco to run my first marathon ever, (which i completed in 4 hours and 6 minutes, respectably)my 2  days in san francisco were amazing! thanks to ash & ken, two very nice and friendly hosts. \\r\\nmy staying was lovely and i wanna return there as soon as possible.\\r\\nthank you so much for this days, castro is a very beautiful area and the view of the city by the room is pleasant!\\r\\nsamy from france! :)wonderful experience.  the location is perfect due to it being on the doorstep of the castro muni station.  so it was simple getting there form sfo and a very short ride to downtown san francisco.  ashish is very hospitable and welcoming and also very respectful of your privacy.  the futon is perfect for the solo traveller.  beautiful large clean bathroom.  it was also lovely to be offered the very healthy dinner and breakfast that the guys put on most days, particularly as it allowed me to meet other guests.  layout of the house is also great in that you often feel you have the place to yourself.  in summary, great value for money, perfect location (if you want to be away from the downtown hustle) and lovely hosts.  ashish was such a great guy. i came to his house pretty late and he offerred me some dinner and to chat/visit with his friends. all of them were nice and i enjoyed chatting for an hour or so. made some friends in the process.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bathroom was super clean and the futon was pretty comfortable. i would definitely stay here again and recommend ashish\\'s place and excellent hosting skills for people wanting to come to san francisco. it was a great stay. everyone there is helpful.what a lovely place ashish and ken have! they made me feel very welcomed and, boy, was the food goooood! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is excellent and the place is very clean. and the dogs are just cute!ashish was very welcoming, the neighborhood was beautiful as well as the apartment, it was exactly what is described and more. unfortunately i couldn\\'t stay for the blueberry pancakes because i had to be out early, but i\\'ll hopefully be back for some soon!this was an amazing stay.  both ashish and ken were really helpful and inviting.  i felt like i dropped in to a thriving san francisco community. place was awesome, close to everything, safe, i could walk everywhere.i just have one thing to say: great! my stay on castro street was just amazing. not only was the space spacious, luminous and clean, but the human experience topped it all. ashish and ken are amazing people, and the whole dynamics of the house makes you feel like you\\'re at home. i am extremely happy of this stay and would recommend this address to anyone i know and like. and i will leave this house feeling happy and enrichened. and very grateful. thank you guys!i was aware the owner will not be there, but hi left all aspects under control and even was efficient returning concerns or answers over details. \\r\\nthe house was good, neighborhood as expected. pictures are always pictures ... but i was over all satisfied and it was a pleasant experience! \\r\\nash, i look forward to meet you in a future trip! ash and ken were lovely hosts who welcomed me into their home and went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. i had a wonderful time staying with them and their housemates who were equally as lovely. paul and chase (the two dogs) were lots of fun to be around and well behaved so they were a bonus too!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was comfortable and the sleeping area is bright and airy. there is a lot of natural light that comes through during the day and there is a nice view of the city from the mezzanine. location wise, it is only a few blocks from market street so getting around on foot or via public transport was really easy.\\r\\n\\r\\ni really enjoyed spending time with ash and ken and would love to come back again the next time i\\'m in the city. they are beautiful people with big hearts and i would highly recommend their space to anyone who is looking for a relaxed and easy going place where you are welcomed in like an old friend.  ash and ken are adorable!. nice house, amazing view, internet wifi very fast, polite people are all the ingredients for an excellent experience for my first time in airb&b! i suggest this house absolutely!amazing, is a very nice place to stay. ashish and his partner ken are the best. is a very nice place to stay, and the ken¨s breakfast are the best. i will stay again when i come back to sfo. \\r\\nthanks for all. it was a great location, amazing views, and wonderful hospitality! ken was a great host- gave me some useful advice on places to go and how best to get there. the dogs were adorable too! i really felt at home there.\\r\\nthanks again ken and ashish!this was my first airbnb experience and it was a positive one!  i had a fantastic time with ashish and ken - they were awesome hosts.  the view is incredible, the house is neat and clean, and beautiful from inside and out!  they know the neighborhood very well and were able to provide plenty of tips and advice.  very accessible too - muni just down the street, plus of course lots of shops in/around market and castro.  they also cook!  i had a delicious lunch the day of my arrival, and coffee & breakfast the following morning.  they really made my stay feel like home.  the hosts were very personable and i was very happy to have them around to talk to and get to know a little more about each other.  there are 2 very friendly dogs which was also a big plus - i love animals and miss them when i travel so it was nice to have some furry critters around.  my only complaint is that i wish i could have stayed longer!!  the day i was leaving, ken and ashish were having folks over for a bar-b-cue - they invited me and again the food was fantastic but i had to leave early to get to the airport.  i\\'m really glad i chose these guys to stay with!  everything exceeded my expectations.  can\\'t wait until next time.\\r\\n\\r\\nashish and kenny could not have been more welcoming during my stay with them. ash invited me to meals and multiple social gatherings, it was really generous. they gave me plenty of space which was impressive as i was staying in their common area! the other housemates were friendly and welcoming as well! although i cut my stay short due to a last minute trip to point reyes, it was a pleasure to meet and stay with ash & kenny!\\r\\n\\r\\ni am pretty sure ash also introduced me to the best ice cream i have ever had. ashish and kenny made me feel right at home right away.  meals were fantastic, homemade crab cakes, yum!!!  picture is exactly what i got and the views were incredible.  and you can\\'t ask for a better neighborhood than the castro.  for a shared room experience, this is a great choice for the price.ashish and ken are amazing, gracious hosts that made me feel welcome upon my first visit to san francisco. prompt communication, keypad entry into the home, fantastic views and location make their place a great choice for anyone staying in san francisco!ashish accepted my late request (only one night in advance) without any problems, even let me leave my luggage there until check-in. i stayed there for only 2 nights but he and ken took great care of me and helped me a lot to get around the city. in combination with the comfortable futon i definitely recommend to stay there, even if you might just want to have a great view of the san francisco skyline.i enjoyed staying at ken and ash\\'s home nd look forward to staying with you in the future! adventures around the world. they also helped me out with some tips about india, i\\'m planing to go next year and they have plenty of experience because they do volunteer work there every year. i did love my stay with ash and ken. the house and neighborhood are great. the house has a nice cultural vibe, maybe because  the indian influence on the decor.  the comfortable futon is on the third floor with a beautiful view  of san francisco. the house is clean and it has two restroom on two different levels. a beautiful kitchen and a back yard complete the house very well.  their house care taker thomas is always around for what ever you need, if ken and ash are not around. ash took me a couple of times and show me the bakeries (i love bread) around the neighborhood. ken cooked me  a delicious breakfast every day that i enjoyed very much over his conversations of his trips and social services in india. ken, ash and \"pablo\" their beautiful dog are very warm and down to earth people that make you feel home since you arrive. the castro neighborhood is very well located and it\\'s  full of good restaurants and shops. if you want to know anything about the history of neighborhood feel free to ask ken or ash; they have been living on the are for several years. also they will be happy to do any good recommendations of activities or places to eat. over all my stay was great and i\\'m looking forward to be host with ken and ash in my next visit with my family to san francisco on april 2015.   great accommodations and solid location would totally stay againhad an amazing time getting to know the \"family\". it\\'s what airbnb should be all about. sharing stories and life with interesting people and feel like you belong there. the house is very silent and tidy, so absolutely fine sleeping in the living room. the dogs are adorable and very well behaved. if you are social and up for a true experience this is the best place! really hope to come back soon!what a great way to travel to sf for the first time. ken, ash, and paul all greeted me with a warm dinner and a great big smile. the view is amazing, so be sure to wake up to see the sunrise! ash even drove me to see the golden gate bridge! \\n\\noverall, a very great experience for my first time using airbnb. definitely recommend them, especially if you\\'re a social person! very nice stay. ashish and his partner made me feel very welcome and prepared a delicious breakfast.  i recommend them very highly.great breakfast, easy going, phenomenal location, amicable pets, crowded yet quiet house, beautiful view. i been a host for 10 months with over 40 trips at my listing, this was my first time as a guest, thank you for the memories!in short: excellent stay with welcoming and warm hosts. from the moment i arrived ash and ken made me feel at home. from the homemade blueberry pancakes each morning to inviting me out to dinner with a bunch of their friends, they are really kind, social beings who sincerely care for their guests. the location is wonderful, the futon is comfy, and the view is amazing. they offer great advice about restaurants and areas to explore in the city. overall an excellent stay in a safe area with interesting and hospitable hosts. i would definitely stay here again. ash and ken are really friendly hosts and respect my privacy. they have two adorable and cute dogs. the house is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. you can get anywhere  by bus and metro.ash and ken were very accommodating, inviting and friendly. they often invited me to their meals, which made me feel at home. they really built a wonderful community and home. their two dogs were also great and sweet! i really enjoyed my stay and gave me advice for the tourist spots. they made my first airbnb experience a memorable one :) thanks so much!i had a wonderful stay at ashish and ken\\'s! they were very welcoming and sweet and very good company - was very nice to speak to fellow teachers :). i was offered to join in on both breakfast and dinner and felt very much at home. \\r\\nlocation is great too :) would definitely come back!very nice hosts, great location, and a gorgeous house. everything was better than expected.\\r\\nthis place was wonderful. the people were wonderful. the views were wonderful . this is why i use airbnb. this is where i will stay every time i am in san francisco. michaelwonderfully located, efficient check-in. nice people. i would stay here again.nice place in an awesome neighborhood , would definitely recommend .i loved this space - it is quaint, cozy, and clean.  lots of interesting decor.  even though ashish and ken were gone they made sure to have caretakers that kept everything looking nice.  the amenities are particularly nice and everyone in the house was kind.  also the location is superb!  if you get lonely the sweet doggies will keep you company.  i would definitely come back.very good accommodations and yes, view was great.  futon was nice and  comfortable.  tim was very nice.  no complaints at all -- but with one positive suggestion.everything was as described. i somehow missed that i would be sharing a bathroom, but that worked out just fine. thomas was great and loved the friendly dogs!great view, clean, perfect location !i had a wonderful stay. the location is perfect, the cozy and comfortable enough fouton. details that made the difference: welcome chocolates on the pillow, beautiful flowers on the table and lovable dogs. the view was undoubtedly the best. great value for quality accommodation, i highly recommend it.it was really an excellent choice for me to stay at this great apartment! very clean and artistic place! i had an audition at san francisco conservatory of music. it literally takes about 10 minute to get to the school by taking muni(subway) at castro. thomas and his girlfriend greeted me when i was there and both very friendly people! and they have an awesome well-trained dog!! :-)ashish\\'s place was pretty clean, quiet, and comfortable. i spent awesome time there. his place is close to the muni station and castro town, there are good bars, restaurants, and grocery stores. definitely, i\\'d like to stay his place next time. highly recommend you stay there when you visit san francisco.very nice apartment with friendly people in a great location. i stayed here for 7 nights and i can confirm that this is a superb location to stay and great value. extremely close to many transport options to explore all parts of the city. although ash and ken were away at the time of my stay, tim looked after everything! the room was well presented, comfortable and had amazing views! communication was excellent and particularly helpful to me as i had flight delays in arriving. i would 100% recommend this to others who are looking to stay in sf.  i enjoyed this stay very much. the space is very clean and the decor is charming. there was ample privacy despite being a futon in an open room. it felt very much like being in a room of my own.\\n\\nthe view of the city is beautiful and wide, and there are comfortable chairs by the windows.\\n\\nthere are two adorable, friendly and very well-behaved dogs. they were mostly unseen to me during my stay but i would not have minded seeing them every day.\\n\\nthe neighborhood is quiet, safe, and comfortably close to castro station.\\n\\nmy hosts were friendly and very accommodating although we didn\\'t cross paths more than once or twice.\\n\\ni would definitely stay again and recommend!staying at ashish\\'s place was great. though the futon was a bit tough on the back, you really can\\'t get more bang from your buck in the middle of the castro. overall, the house was super clean and the hosts were very respectful of my privacy though i was staying in the living room. if you\\'re looking for affordable housing in the middle of a great location, this is the place!view was great. bed was comfortable, and good place to go downtown by public transportation. really enjoyed my trip! nice~everything was great with the stay - the view and neighborhood were exactly as promised!all the hosts went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. the place was very clean and has a gorgeous view onto san francisco - just breathtaking! additionally, it is centrally located - just 1-2 minutes from the castro station, so a perfect starting point for discovering san francisco. ashish was always very quick in answering my questions and was very helpful in making my stay a good experience. next time i am in the city, there is no doubt in my mind that i will stay here. thank you!great hosts, really made me feel welcome and at home. the view in the loft was great! this space was amazing!! perfect location i can\\'t wait for my next trip to sf and hope it is available. ashish is very welcoming and hospitable. they make you feel like you have known them forever.ashish is a great fun host. his house is clean. the neighborhood is in a great location.this place is the most beautiful place that i\\'ve visit around castro! not only because of its beautiful view and quite neighborhood, but also  host and his dog are so nice and kind! i\\'ll come back again if possible.ashish and kenny are great hosts! they welcomed me with such openness and friendliness, making me feel right at home. the lounge room was fantastic! you can wake up early to watch the beautiful city sunrise right from the window, or simply be woken up by the morning sun. the place is at a great location in castro, easy to go to anywhere. the corona heights park was within 10 min walk. you can walk there and have a 360 degree unobstructed view of the whole city! anyway, great place to stay! highly recommended! the coolest airbnb ever! great hosts, lots of hospitality and great food. i would definitely stay here again. :)i had a very pleasant stay at ashish\\'s place. although i didn\\'t get the chance to spend much time with the host, through a brief conversation it\\'s not difficult to tell ashish is a very nice person. what else can i say but \"wow\". ashish and ken were the ultimate hosts, treating me like both a longtime friend and a family member in their home from the moment we met. i not only felt comfortable, safe and clean in their home, but i felt welcome. the house is in a great neighborhood within walking distance to great food, coffee and drinking options, along with public transportation that will get you anywhere in the city you need to go. ken offered some incredible breakfast options every morning and ashish even took me to crissy park for a run; both went well beyond the call of duty. the space, although in an open area of the top floor, felt private and respected, and was spacious with an incredible view of the city. this is a no-brainer:  for your next trip to sf, don\\'t think twice about staying with ashish and ken. an incredible, memorable experience!what can i say that hasn\\'t already been said?! ashish and ken where excellent hosts. i was warmly greeted and felt  immediately at ease in their home. location is ideal if you want walking access around castro and mission and public transit is just a few blocks away. you can get anywhere you want to go easily and affordably. the futon was comfortable and offers enough privacy to feel like your own space.  really warm, genuine people that go above and beyond to enhance their guests experience. thanks ashish and ken -it was so lovely to meet you both. an inspired trip was had and i hope to return again sooner than later. take care!hosts were great! they offer great ideas on what to do in the area. both are well traveled, hardworking and considerate of their guests. very hospitable and they make a great breakfast! their home is comfortable and beautifully located in the castro neighborhood. i would stay again for sure if back in sf!i had a very enjoyable time staying with ashish and kenny. they were both very hospitable and made me feel completely welcome during my entire stay. the space was exactly as described and, indeed, included a magnificent view. the futon, located on the top floor, was actually quite comfortable and felt very private for a shared space. overall, this served as an amazing, centrally-located spot from which to explore san francisco. i had a wonderful time staying with ash & ken.  this was my first airbnb experience, & it couldn\\'t have been better.  every morning, ken would make us a super delicious breakfast, & maybe due to coincidence, i loved all the guests!  they were so nice, they have invited me to two dinners (one was a birthday party for close friends) and introduced me to many of their friends.  one of the best treats was paul the black lab greeting me every morning :)  i\\'m sure he won\\'t if you don\\'t want him to, but it made my stay!  if all airbnb experiences are like that then it doesn\\'t get any better!  stay with ash & ken.staying with ashish and co. was a wonderful experience! from the minute i got there i felt welcomed, and totally comfortable. a beautiful house, and sleeping on the futon afforded lots of privacy and the most beautiful view. i can\\'t recommend this place enough! friendly, warm, clean and all with a good laugh and a pancake breakfast. thanks again for the top notch accommodations! you want a freakin\\' awesome place to stay in sf. this is a freakin\\' awesome one.ash and kenny have a lovely space that is tended to almost as well as they tend to their guests. ;) you\\'ll feel at home from the moment you\\'re greeted by paul, to your last delicious breakfast with the fam. as a bonus both ash and ken give excellent touring advice, all of which is easily accessible on foot or via public transport from the castro. highly recommended airbnb if you\\'re looking to meet some quality, legit locals with big hearts and killer kitchen instincts.  ☆☆☆☆☆ashish and ken have to be the greatest hosts ever!!! they made me feel as if i was part of their own family and extremely helpful. even to the point of negotiating my pay package for a new job lol. they really are the best two guys you can stay with. now about the house, it\\'s everything described and more with one of the most spectacular views of the city and the futon was incredible to sleep on and provides you with everything you need for a great experience in san francisco. i would recommend these two in heartbeat!!! nice two days with these really gentlemen. a big and tasty breakfast each morning and good conversations. thank you for your welcome and next time i ll bring you à little dog.\\r\\ni recommend great central location for exploring the city. hosts ashish and ken are lovely. paul the dog is a good, good boy. be sure to ask them about the ashish breakfast.and the view from the third floor is indeed wonderful. so let\\'s just start with the house! the view alone, would make anyone drool and stand in awe. the location of the  house is in the center of the castro, and i know i spent many hours of my trip just exploring the neighboring area! ash and ken (along with paul), made me feel so comfortable and treated me like family. i was invited to their dinner party on sunday, and felt that i have made life long friends with them and the other attendees. i was completely comfortable and very happy with the accommodations. i will never forget the wonderful chats i had with these fine men, and the moments of tagging along to walk paul. i was so happy that they brought me into their home, and made me feel so welcomed. when i come back to san francisco, i will definitely book with ash and ken again. i miss them so much already, and i wish them all the best! they are truly my home away from home. \\r\\n\\r\\ncheers!i only stayed for one night, with a short sleep between night and morning business meetings, and this was the perfect place to crash. ashish is a great host, the bed is very clean and comfortable, and the room have a beautiful view with sun coming in in the morning. highly recommended!the description for the room was accurate as well as the neighborhood. was very centrally located to lots of bars and restaurants and parks.very clean and comfortable, and good location. if you would like to explore the fascinating city, this is a very nice place to stay.ashish and ken were so kind and awesome. i would definitely book again here. the location was on point and parking was surprisingly good for the whole stay. thank you guys!  it was great!ash and ken where amazing hosts. as my first airbnb experience i expected some hiccups, but non were present during my trip. the location is great, one block from market and next to a great bar scene. the room itself was staged as a mini bachelor with a futon bed, mini fridge, tv, and one amazing view of the city. on my last day ash and ken invited me to breakfast; food + conversation was great. they make you feel at home while always handy to give suggestions/directions around town.this was my 3rd airbnb experience and i can honestly say it was the best one so far. the other 2 were great, but ash and ken went above and beyond to create a true b&b feeling. the space is lovely and clean, the breakfasts each morning were delicious, and the hosts were kind and welcoming. if/when i\\'m ever back in sf, i would definitely want to stay here again.great everything! very convenient neighborhood! ash and ken are awesome hosts! ken is super nice!!! it is an amazing bnb experience~!!!ashish was so, so lovely! could not have asked for a better place to stay during my time in san francisco! they even made me blueberry pancakes one morning (they were delicious). \\r\\nneighborhood is great and lots of bars, restaurants, etc. within walking distance. if you\\'re visiting san francisco this is the place to stay! ash and ken were amazing hosts and have a beautiful apartment located in the castro area. they not only suggested places to visit, but the also cooked lovely breakfasts (and a dinner) for me. if i were to come back to sf, i would definitely stay there again.absolute pleasure to stay at ash and ken\\'s. beautiful place, well-located. outstanding pancakes. excellent option for those visiting san francisco! 5 stars!i had the best time staying with ken and ash. i truly felt like i was one of their close friends. our two morning walks with mr. paul were incredible. they deserve 10 stars for how awesome their airbnb is. ashish and ken were excellent hosts.. i was welcomed immediately with a friendly dinner amongst friends. their home is beautiful, clean and in a perfect location to get anywhere you need in the city. highly recommend staying with them.ashish and ken are great hosts and interesting people. the space, which has a great view of the city and cable tv, was private and out of the way of the main living area. lots of nice details, such as chocolates on the pillow.my hosts made me feel very welcome in their home. they offered me a wonderful dinner and breakfast. eventhough the futon is in the living room i never felt disturbed by anyone. they are perfectly located in san francisco, i never used public transportation since walking was more comfortable for me. also big plus, ashish and kenney can give you best advice on where to go and where to eat.ashish and ken were awesome hosts! the room was very sunny and spacious, and the view was spectacular. location is great, walking distance from the heart of the castro, and a short muni ride from elsewhere in sf. i\\'d absolutely recommend staying with them for any length of time - there might even be donuts :-)everything was as described, phenomenal view and they invited me for a nice dinner cooked downstairs and gave a bit of local and personal history + met other interesting people living or visiting there.  highly recommended :)felt like coming home. easy going, accurate description of space. kinda hard to leave. if and when i get back to that city this is my first place to check for availability.this is a beautiful house with stunning views and a perfect location for exploring the city.  toby was an excellent host and the resident labrador paul is an added bonus.  couldn\\'t have asked for a better introduction to sf - highly recommended.i was more than happy to book ashish’s place when i read that he uses the proceeds from airbnb to do volunteer work around the world. it was a in fact a pleasure staying here. the place exactly as it is explained and shown in the pictures. very convenient location - right in the middle of everything, yet quiet and comfortable. sunny with a beautiful view. \\r\\n\\r\\nthough i didn\\'t meet ashish, i had the pleasure of meeting their nephew toby. he was very accommodating and extremely respectful of my privacy. he was also very prompt with his responses to all questions. \\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!!\\r\\nthe place was wonderful, with a sunrise ever morning, very nice neighborhood and close to everywhere. even i didn\\'t know personally ashish, he\\'s nephew nswerd all my questions. i will recomemd anyone traveling solo to stay at ashish\\'s place.great place to stay that\\'s easy to get around. toby was a great host, helped with any questions i had, and gave recommendations for places to eat. flexible with check in and check out.the descriptions in the listing are very accurate. it was an excellent spot for me on my first visit to san francisco. clean environment, great calm and clean house dog, the amenity availability.\\n\\ni didnt take the opportunity to watch tv or use any amenities besides the bathroom. the host was very friendly and gave good advice on travelling.\\n\\nthis listing is excellent for someone like me who was just passing through san francisco for a couple nights and wanted a safe, comfortable place to sleep while they are out in the city the rest of the time.\\n\\nthe view was great and nice to wake up to.\\n\\nyou are sleeping on a futon in a common space as opposed to a private room, but the area is on the third (and final) floor and it felt private enough during the time that i was there.\\n\\nthe location was also great as well, close to multiple public transportation systems that i used to check out alcatraz and different downtown areas.\\n\\nbeing a first time airbnb\\'er and california traveler, it would be difficult to beat the value that i got from this.i was early and i was able to store my bags there. the place was well kept and maintained. the neighborhood  was safe. the only issue was that the water heater didn\\'t work and i had to take a cold shower. it woke me up though!! :) overall it was a good place to stay. i stayed in the loft area on the top floor and it was fantastic! the windows run the entire length of the east wall and boast stunning views of downtown and the bay. the sunrises are ridiculously beautiful (unless it\\'s foggy of course, but even then it\\'s a beautiful, peaceful world outside the window).  ashish was out of town during my stay, but his nephew was a wonderful host and was able to get me checked in a bit early. there was a bit of an issue with the hot water, and he made it a priority and addressed it quickly. paul, the dog, was a joy to be around, a very mellow fellow. i even got to tag along on one of his walks to the park. the location of the house is perfect and provides an easy walk to the castro muni stop, or the f-market trolley car line (goes to the ferry building or fisherman\\'s wharf), or the n-judah muni train that goes right out to ocean beach for stunning sunset views.  and it\\'s an easy walk to the castro theatre.  be sure to catch a classic movie there and enjoy the live organ music before the film, such a great venue.  the loft room at ashish\\'s has a mini-fridge and a microwave, very convenient.  note that it is a true loft and privacy is limited, but it worked great for me as a single guest.  i would love to stay at ashish\\'s again.  thank you for offering such a cozy and welcoming environment in a charming san francisco home and neighborhood.wow what a great place to stay.  the hosts were so warm and welcoming.  i loved the loft upstairs with the view - and such beautiful artwork on the walls.  it felt like home.  additionally there was another couple staying downstairs so i spent the day the touring the city with them.  so much fun.  much better than the boring downtown fancy hotel i stayed at.home is lovely and welcoming with interesting artwork and fabulous view. host was very accommodating and friendly and made me feel comfortable. will definitely stay again while visiting my  new grandson (and his parents too!)this is a very welcoming and considerate environment. also a beautiful home with a great energy about it, i felt right at home. the location is totally accessible and i would totally recommend staying here! great place if you\\'re traveling to sf and just need a bed to sink into. clean, quiet, and cozy!i have wonderful stay in ashish\\'s home. recommend those who want to stay closer to downtown but not want to stay in hotel!asish was welcoming and helpful, the space was clean and exactly as described. i would come back for this experience!staying at ashish was simply the best possible experience i could have while staying in sf. the location is exeptional so is the futon! i sincerly recommend.\\r\\ni had a great stay, i felt comfortable and welcomed by the hosts who have been so kind to me.\\r\\nashish\\'s house is in the best location, so easy to go around sf from castro. the house is very clean and nice itself. \\r\\ni will highly recommend this place to any traveler visiting the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you again for everything !what can i say about ash and ken that has not been mentioned previously? from the moment i stepped through the front door for the first time (mind, this was my first airbnb experience), their place genuinely felt like home. their kind, buoyant spirits are infectious, they are incredibly hospitable and certainly go out of their way to ensure you have the best time possible during your stay in san francisco. their willingness to share local knowledge and just their knowledge in general was something i was so grateful for, and as a side note, their cooking is top notch. we also went to the theatre on my final night, which was the perfect way to conclude my stay in sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house itself reflects their character and showcases some amazing artefacts collected during their many travels they\\'ve shared. the space in which you live/sleep is a shared place as described, which certainly was not a problem. the views every morning are worth the price of admission alone as you get to see the sun rising over a wide panorama of the city skyline and surrounding neighbourhoods. and pauly....this dog is one of the cutest gentle giants i have had the pleasure of meeting. he has some incredible dancing shoes! \\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend any friends to stay with these gentlemen. my time there was an absolute pleasure and i\\'ll definitely rebook with them whenever i return to sf. i have returned to this location now 4 times so i obviously think it is great. ashish and ken are the most hospitable hosts i have encountered...........always inviting me to participate in their festivities, activities, and food! the home is beautifully decorated with interesting art from around the world.  the room is spotless, the view amazing, and the atmosphere relaxing and comfortable. they make you feel like old friends as they share this special location. hosts were super hospitable. they even invited me with a wonderful breakfast the two days. \\r\\nthe place is located at a quiet nice neighborhood, just as described. \\r\\nthe futon is comfortable to crush 1 or 2 nights. \\r\\nthe only thing which didn\\'t say in the description is that the futon is just in front of the hosts room and you have to share the bath with them. something to consider if you are looking for privacy. \\r\\nin general, the stay was great.ashish and ken, and even their friends are amazing people. they really welcome you with open hearts and arms, and i promise you that you will laugh at least twice for every conversation you have with them- especially ashish. ken is very sincere and kind, and the room is very comfortable with a nice view. i really enjoyed my stay there, and their community is something that i haven\\'t seen in a long, long time. they really have a great sense of family and friends :) everyone was so welcoming and nice. i was instantly invited to brunch and i had not even arrived yet. the fulton was a shared space but that was not an issue, as privacy was still given and the view was amazing to wake up to in the morning. its looks exactly as listed. i would recommend this place to anybody visting sf. a great first airbnb stay.ashish, ken and paul the dog were just awesome. i was in town on business and they went out of their way to accomodate anything and everything i  needed. from touring the neighbourhood to foodie advice and even custom breakfasts in the morning. raised the bar for airbnb hosting!ashishi and his family are friendly. the room small but warm and quiet. good place to sleep. i recommend.great host, location, & stay! thanks!excellent hospitatility, great location, safe, reliable and within great distance of city life and transportation. i\\'ll definitely book this room again.   great location and value. highly recommend!he was not able to be there. nicely left chocolates on the pillow. great neighborhood. lots of stairs which was ok for me.i had an amazing time staying with ashish :) eventhough it is an open space privacy was not an issue. ashish, devlin and paul ( their gorgeous dog) were super accomodating since the begining and the location allows you to move easily through the city! there are great restaurants and nightlife close by and the view from the room is beautiful. \\r\\nthank you for such a fun time! was very worried of what to expect trying something like air bnb, which for me is extremely new, and very progressive.... all i can say is i am very thankful i chose ashish as my very 1st host! the room was exactly what i wanted and more. so clean and cozy... i was here for work, so i didn\\'t have much time to enjoy all the wonderful amenities which were available to me. he answered every question i had, and very promptly... will most certainly stay again and i highly recommend!!perfect location steps from the castro muni.  the apartment was clean, well decorated, and the view was superb.  i had a phenomenal stay and would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable, quiet, and convenient place to stay while visiting the beautiful city of san francisco! i had a great experience at ashish\\'s place and with toby\\'s help. it was a great quality and affordability for the area. it was just 2-3 blocks from market street, leading up to the famed 18th street of castro. you could easily find food, night life, or anything else you wanted to in just 5 minutes of strolling. you could also walk to dolores park in 10-15 minutes. i was bit worried with being in a \"shared room\" but i had my privacy with the coverings. your bed is right next to a large window, but i was not expecting the morning sun on my face at 7am! that\\'s alright with me however because the view was great and i needed a nudge to wake up :)very convenient location, walking distance to the muni stations, market st. castro centers etc. the view from the living room is amazing... see the sun rising right in your bed... a little noisy because of the street but i loved it. thanks toby for being such a great host...my stay in ashish\\'s house was perfect! even the bed is in living room, it\\'s highly private and comfortable!ashish has a lovely apartment located in an amazing part of town. if you are looking for somewhere affordable and lovely to stay near the castro or the mission, look no further. i had no trouble finding the residence which was so beautifully and centrally located-exactly what i had hope for in regards to my plans and time spent in san francisco! ashish made himself available as well as a family member just in case since he wasn\\'t in town. i was blown away and would highly recommend-in addition to planning to return myself, in the future! it\\'s really amazing experience to visit here, comfortable and quiet place. the host lisa provide everything as she could do, it\\'s like your own home with great detain design everywhere. i will definitely to revisit here in the future. thanks lisa!ashish and kenny were warm, wonderful hosts who went out of their way to make cinnamon (my maltese) and i feel like home. they have a black lab paul who is super well-trained and a perfect gentleman, and they all showered cinnamon with love and care. they were so generous to extend invitations to a few delicious home-cooked lunches and breakfasts while i was there. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is in an amazing location, just up a small hill from top restaurants and life/culture of the castro district. convenient to transport and a short walk to 3 awesome yoga studios i would definitely recommend (yoga garden, yoga tree and laughing lotus)!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe futon itself is super comfortable, the room is light and bright on the top floor. bathroom is clean and shower pressure great! \\r\\n\\r\\nit is a cheerful place and visitors and guests are coming and going, i loved the connections and story sharing i experienced during the stay. thank you ashish, kenny and paul for a wonderful stay!!!ashish and ken were great hosts! they happened to be hosting a dinner party the night i arrived, which i was invited me to join for a delicious meal. ashish was very accommodating with my dog, and provided me with some really good recommendations of sights to check out and places to eat. i was also invited to join them on a morning dog walk at crissy field, an amazing dog friendly park right under the golden gate that i never would have found on my own. the shared space and bath were both very clean, and the futon was surprisingly comfortable to sleep on. their home is in a great location, right in the heart of san fransisco, with countless food options, parks, and things to do within walking/biking distance. ashish also let me use their washer and dryer during my stay to do a much needed load of laundry. i would certainly stay with ashish again, and recommend his home for any one looking for a great san fransisco experience at a very reasonable price!ash and ken were very warm and welcoming.  paul, their wonderful black lab was particularly welcoming.  ken cooked a great breakfast for us on my departure day.  great location, view of the city from bed!ash, ken, and paul were all very chill. i was new to the city and they were very nice people. i would totally stay with them again. :)i had a great stay with ashish, ken and paul( their very sweet, well-behaved dog). the room i stayed in was clean and comfortable and the room had a great view of the city. ken cooked a delicious breakfast the following morning and i enjoyed chatting with him. i would definitely recommend staying with ashish and ken if you\\'re thinking about a trip to sf. ash, ken, and paul were all very chill. i was new to the city and they were very nice people. i would totally stay with them again. :)tom made me feel at home for my stay there.

feature is beautifully designed and tastefully arranged. my favorite part was the southward view from the third-floor balcony, complete with outdoor lounge chair. i wanted to cancel my sunday plans and just read all day in the sf sun and watch bernal heights and the bay change color. location is key, a few blocks away from dolores park, and within eyesight of a muni metro stop. bed was so comfortable i\\'m considering changing up my entire bed situation at home. you will love this place! perfect for:\\r\\n- communal meals\\r\\n- family gatherings\\r\\n- controlled kids\\r\\n- exploring the mission \\r\\n- public trans\\r\\n- modern architecture groupies\\r\\n\\r\\nwe stayed at the olcott\\'s house with a bunch of relatives for a family wedding, and our choice was perfect! if you\\'re looking for a house to put your feet up, this is not it: white couches and modern bathrooms with accompanying squeegee responsibilities! this is a design jewel - the essence of modern with some quirks. the hosts left very clear guidelines on how to maintain the house and what to watch out for, which made it easier. still, the beautiful decor and convenient location could not be beat. the dining room was our go-to spot, and made catching up with family as a group easy.thank goodness, because the kitchen cries out to be cooked in! additionally, i was delighted by how child-friendly the space and hosts were - swings downstairs, toys left out for our daughter and a crib all set up for us. she had a blast playing with the trains and toy kitchen and we loved the kiddie gates. the welcoming touches made the grown-ups just as happy: sweet snacks and a bottle of wine. overall, i cannot recommend this spot highly enough. we spent about a week at the olcotts\\' residence and totally enjoyed it. it is a wonderful neighborhood with a beautiful park next to it. old folks may find the hills a bit of a challenge but otherwise for a young family, i highly recommend it. thanks again for sharing this wonderful home with uswe (a family of 5) felt privileged to stay in this spacious, light house in a quiet street in the civilized part of mission district.  especially the kids loved the bath and  for them it was a little hard in the beginning of the stay to deal with no tv in the house. the beds which were sleeping very well. well equiped hous and kitchen, great views from the balcony. and a house where you realize you live more in the back than in the front. dolores park around the corner. walks to mission (downhill) and castro (uphill) not for the faint harted but highly rewarding. the j-line stop almost on your door step opens the rest of the city for you. \\r\\nvery nice and clean place!a fantastic style in a great part of sf. the host communicated superbly and helped personalised our stay. the house its self is amazing. high end spec and great quality.we felt very welcome. the house was lovely as is clear from all the online pictures. the location is ideal.julie and brad\\'s home feels as wonderful as it looks in photos. the house itself is amazing, the neighborhood is fantastic, super close to public transport, and walking distance to great eats. for a group of four adults we had all we needed for a week\\'s stay, and i\\'d definitely try to seek this place out again next time!lovely house in a great location. pictures are true to what the house was like. julie and brad were available if you needed them.great neighbourhood, great views and lovely house, highly recommended.we spent five days in julie and brad\\'s around thanksgiving break.  julie and brad warmly welcomed us to their beautiful home, quickly making us at home.  they were generous and flexible to allow us to have a big thanksgiving dinner.  their kitchen is well equipped and was a great place to cook.  the house is tastefully and thoughtfully decorated, calm, fun and peaceful.  the location of the house is also a big plus.  overall, a wonderful stay. beautiful house and very helpful hosts. the neighborhood is great and the house is literally a few steps from the muni to downtown sf. had a few problems with the wifi, and the speakers did not work, but besides that, everything was great. i moved here for school and this was the first place i felt truly welcome.  i wish i could have stayed.  its right around the corner from judah and golden gate park.  the house is super nice, but the people are even better.  the bed was super comfy. this is the type of house and people i dream of living with.  thanks alan.  alan made us feel as if we actually lived in his house. he made us feel very comfortable and safe, and it was as if the city was our own. he did a great job at letting us know where everything was at, i.e.) grocery store, liquor store, etc. we had access to everything we needed in the house, and he even lets you watch netflix, haha. the room was very cozy, and the hot tub was always a great time. alan is a great guy, i highly recommend staying here. the flat is in a very nice area close to the golden gate park, 3 mins to metro and bus. there is a hot tub in the backyard, everything is very clean and you have much space.\\r\\nthe bed for two is gread, but i would not recommend the couch if you are more people for more than a few nights, as the mattress is very soft and thin.\\r\\nit was great to stay there, thank you!alan was very friendly and accommodating. a friend and i just needed a place to crash for two nights, and the room fit us perfectly. the location is very convenient and really is just a block from catching the n towards downtown or the beach.had a short stay in alan\\'s home. we didn\\'t get to meet alan, but he confirmed our arrival time and had keys waiting for us! it was clean comfortable and in a very nice neighborhood walking distance to the golden  gate park. we went to giants game and only had to walk a few blocks to the n train that delivers you to the stadium for 2.50! can\\'t beat that.accurate description, nice neighborhood. loved the house at the first look, alan is great, we were allowed pretty much everything, and were comfortable with it of course. if i am to come to sf again, i would gladly stay there. our stay at alan\\'s place was amazing! very (!!) nice and clean house, great location (close to train to city, the ocean, and lots of shops.

living room! great host, great city! we would definitly recommend it to anyone! (we were a group of 4 and did not have any troubles regarding space) alan  was extremely accommodating and available for questions and help during our stay. the place was fantastic. it was really easy to get around the city from his location. we walked in the area a lot. there were great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance, which is really important when you don\\'t have a rental car. i highly recommend this place and host. it had everything we needed!great place, great host and great location. alan keeps a clean and welcoming place that i would suggest to anyone. being next to the park and public transportation was awesome.accurate description, alan\\'s house is a cozy place. alan was a great host - responsive, accommodating, and has a very well-kept and comfy house!

the house was very clean and just as described. the instructions were easy to follow and there was no problem with check-in or check-out. the city/neighborhood info that matt includes with the apartment is thorough, helpful, and incredibly useful.\\r\\n\\r\\ni reserved his place for my parents and some of their friends who were in town for a long weekend. speaking as a local, you cannot get a better location. totally walkable to multiple neighborhoods that have great sites, restaurants, and cafes. centrally located and only 2 blocks to public transit. \\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommend matt and his home for a group of people. split the cost and it is cheaper than a hotel. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks!great home in the heart of san francisco. myself and two co-workers rented the house for a work week in san francisco, and enjoyed it thoroughly. the house was very clean, nicely decorated and very comfortable to live and sleep in.\\r\\n\\r\\nmatt was very helpful in getting us all set for our trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nmany fun coffee shops, restaurants in all directions from the house.this was my first time using airbnb, and matt made it such a great experience!

the house is huge, all three bedrooms had plenty of space and large closets and the bathrooms were a great size as well. beds were very comfortable. living area downstairs was spacious and well decorated! my only regret is that we didn\\'t book it for the whole weekend so we could enjoy the space longer! matt was a terrific host! he was incredibly responsive to all emails and requests. i\\'m very picky, so i had a lot of questions before we rented his wonderful home.  he always responded cheerfully within an hour or so. we had a few issues upon arrival, but matt and jason attended to them immediately. they were really conerned about our comfort and well being, which was greatly appreciated. the listing was accurate, and the home was even lovlier than depicted in the pictures. the rooms were bright and spacious with new contemporary furnishings. there is a wonderful deck overlooking the sweet backyard and the house is very private. the home was extremely quiet which allowed for very peaceful sleep in comfy new beds. no street noise whatsoever on a quiet, safe and cute street. the neighborhood was great with everything you need just around the corner. plenty of cafes, restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops...yum!

a short walk to some of the best coffee, restaurants, bars, clubs, public transit, and also dolores park. this home had everything we could have asked for and more. i\\'ll definitely be recommending this listing to friend and family. thanks matt!matt\\'s house is incredible. we felt at home during our stay here. the location is great, with great restaurants nearby. i can\\'t recommend it enough, as matt was really friendly and assistive during our stay there.the house was beautiful, very spacious,  and clean.  bathrooms were great!

the hosts have thought of everything. it\\'s a great experience. i\\'ll definitely choose here next time if it\\'s available.\\n:d my wife, daughter and two friends and i stayed at this house for eight days. it was wonderful. the house itself is the best of both worlds: you feel the century-old character that you expect from a residence in an old san francisco neighborhood, but it comes with modern conveniences that are nice when at vacation spots, like updated kitchen and bathrooms. we found that the large kitchen, dining room, and balcony/deck just off the dining room were perfect for cooking or takeout when we needed a break from the plethora of local restaurants within walking distance. the neighborhood is exciting and lively but the particular street that the house resides on is quiet and residential, the perfect combination. plus it\\'s just steps from a number of muni routes that get you anywhere you need to go. matt was responsive to our questions. i\\'d stay here again.staying at the edwardian in the heart of the castro was fantastic and a welcome break from the craziness of conference life. the neighborhood was quiet, but only one block away was life and partying in the castro. getting downtown was super easy with the muni right nearby and excellent food and drink was right around the corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was fantastic - more than enough space and very well appointed. it was an amazing place to relax after a long day. all of the linens were plush and made for a hotel like experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nmatt and jason were excellent hosts and provided a plethora of information up front that allowed for a very easy stay. matt was responsive to any inquiries and made for a very easy stay.my friends and i couldn\\'t have asked for more. this house is perfectly located in the heart of the castro. any amenity from the house or the neighborhood is easily accessible and available. it\\'s astonishingly quiet given its location. \\n\\ncheck in and checkout was seamless, and the use of the august lock meant we didn\\'t have to carry keys with us anywhere. i would stay here again in a heartbeat!house was very nice and in an excellent location.  it was clean and comfortable.  we enjoyed our stay.matt\\'s house surprised everyone in my group of 5 as being even nicer than in the pictures.  it\\'s a beautiful, comfortable, and spacious home.  it was very helpful to have use of the garage and laundry as well.  i\\'ll definitely look to stay here again if i travel to sf again with a group--great location and great hosts!this house is absolutely beautiful and in great shape. i stayed here with my bridesmaids for my wedding weekend and couldn\\'t have asked for a better location. matt was also super organized and the 18 page welcome packet made everything so easy! thanks so much for letting us stay here for such a special occasion. highly recommend for any groups traveling to sf!this house was one of the best airbnb experiences i have ever had! it is just amazingly beautiful, the location couldn\\'t be better and the host went the extra mile to leave us a bucket of candy as we arrived on halloween night and should be prepared for any trick-or-treaters. \\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!great place, easy check in, conveinient locationmatt is a fantastic host; he made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our time in sf.  the house is beautiful and in a great location.  everything you need is in walking distance.  public transportation is a block away and very convenient.  being able to park right in front of the house and have access to the garage made our lives so much easier.  the only thing we lacked was knives and cookware for the kitchen.  since we spent thanksgiving at the house we definitely put the kitchen to use but we had to buy quite a few things to make up for what the house did not have; however, i left a suggestion list for matt and i\\'m sure he will buy a few supplies.  overall, i would recommend this home to everyone and i will definitely be back.  thanks matt!!  we enjoyed it! :-)   matt was a great host. the house was beautifully decorated. everything worked really well. we were so sad to leave this wonderful homewe can\\'t stress enough how much we enjoyed our stay here. the home is beautiful, the pictures don\\'t do the home enough justice. it\\'s close to a long list of restaurants and bars, yet the neighborhood is still fairly quiet as we were not disturbed in the late evening. thank you guys so much and if we come to san fran anytime soon we will be sure to stay at your home again.matt san\\neverything is perfect. clean and beautiful. so comfortable. and location is very good. around house it is very convinience to go to everywhere. thank youi stayed here over the new year with my parents, sister and her partner. we had been to sf before so we were wanting to stay further away from the really touristy areas (fishermans wharf, union square). the location was great for us. lots of good places to eat and a short uber ride to almost anywhere. the muni station and tram stop were also super close by on market st.\\nthe house had plenty of space and was well maintained. the full kitchen was fantastic if you wanted a night in instead of eating at a restaurant. matt and jason made it super easy to access the house via a lockbox. they also sent over a handy (and funny!) manual for the house with dining an transport info for the local area.\\nthis is a great option if there are a few of you staying together.\\nexcellent trip!

(sorry zoe, i hope it will not force you to open a coffee place for your guests). zoe is an awesome person. at first, i was happy that we will be alone in the apartment, but now knowing zoe (and her cat!),i wished she had been there the whole time. \\r\\nwe had the absolute best time in sf staying in zoe\\'s apartment. her place is much more delightful than the photos could ever show. her taste is impeccable. additionally, zoe is a gracious host. she made us breakfast our first morning there!

thanks zoe! ultra stylish apartment in an ultra hip neighbourhood. loved it! we were 2 adults, 1 toddler, and 1 infant. the place is up one flight of steepish stairs, so wouldn\\'t be easy to get a large stroller up and down (luckily we had a small one). some of the furniture looked a bit delicate, some table items placed in not toddler friendly places. we tucked a few things in the closet so we wouldn\\'t have any accidents. beds/sheets/pillows were super comfortable. it\\'s the perfect living room for hanging out with a few friends over a bottle of wine and some sweets from bi-rite.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s well located for foodies, and zoe provides and extensive list of recommendations upon arrival. yum! we could have stayed there for a whole week to try out all the restaurants we wanted to, but not having a babysitter put a bit of a damper on that. but who knew bi-rite grocery has a delicious deli and prepared meals. very much enjoyed getting tartine pastries for breakfast in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is notorious for not being parking friendly, but with kids we decided to rent a car and parked in a indoor lot about 7 min walk away for $25/day. we walked for the most part, and used uber when we were tired.this place is beautiful and zoe was a lovely hostess. the apartment is full of well chosen furniture and quirky art, living room full of sun in the afternoon, comfy bed, everything we could want. \\r\\nmy husband, daughter and i stayed for a week and had a great time. the apartment is right in the thick of things, all the valencia st shops and restaurants, right close to dolores park and the awesome new playground, easy walk to bart. \\r\\nthanks you zoe for a terrific, relaxing vacation. staying at zoe\\'s place was the best part of the sf trip. the place is awesome! beautiful, fresh and funky. zoe met us at the door and we felt right at home. everything worked, nothing was missing. we were 3 sharing the space and are all super content. the kitchen is great, there is a little hang out area next to it which gets a lot of sunlight so we were hanging there some. the two bedrooms both feel like 5-star hotel rooms with personality and the living room is super chill. the location is great, on a quiet street in the middle of mission. will stay there every time i\\'m in sf if i can. through out the stay zoe checked in on us making sure we very happy, she advised on things to do, restaurants and invited us to hang out. awesome girl! i\\'m zoeified.loved staying at this beautiful apartment in such an amazing location. zoe was a fantastic host. she thought of everything from giving us great tips for local restaurants to providing bathroom products and an immaculate apartment. i would definitely recommend staying here.very comfortable, excellently located and beautifully decorated airbnb.such an awesome host! would be a pleasure to stay at her property again. this place is tremendous ! very nice apartment, spacious and beautifully decorated. i love the style, feel like at home instantaneously... also the location is great, right in the vibrant heart of mission district. you will find everything you need at walking distance, shop, groceries, wine shop, bar & restaurant, classique & upscale... i put this place in my favorites and will return for sure. i had a great time. the apartment is large, stylishly decorated and well equipped for a perfect stay. coffee bars, groceries (bi rite) and restaurants are all walking distance. zoe was very friendly and welcoming host, and made sure i had a great time.  zoe was a wonderful host. her apartment is beautifully appointed. the neighborhood is eclectic and convenient. we would definitely choose to stay here again on future trips to sf. zoe was an incredibly gracious host. her space is truly a sf gem; one of the nicest appointed and most comfortable i\\'ve seen in a city i\\'m quite familiar with. truly a pleasure and recommend for anyone looking to stay in the middle of one of the city\\'s vibrant neighborhoods in comfortable surroundings.zoe was an incredible host! her house was clean, tidy and so comfy! it is also very nicely decorated! the location was awesome, and our stay was wonderful all in all! i will definitely book that listing again!what an incredibly spacious, stylish and welcoming apartment. zoe made sure we felt right at home in her unique and eclectic world of warm woods, rich leather, cozy comforters and amazing art. we\\'re still shocked how quiet it was when the hip hustle and bustle of the mission district was just a few steps away. restaurants, boutiques, street fairs, music and people watching were right in our backyard--along with a lovable, non-allergic, tail-free cat called rabbit!  our 20-something daughter had her own room and bath, and couldn\\'t wait to host a dinner party for a small group of friends in zoe\\'s well-stocked kitchen. it was three days of bliss that we wished we could\\'ve stretched to three weeks...months...years. zoe and her home are the perfect reflections of one another:  gracious, joyful, open, inviting and a lot of fun! we can\\'t wait to go back.cannot recommend zoe\\'s apartment highly enough.\\nsimply a delight to be in -  beautifully styled interior, well-stocked kitchen (if cooking is your thing), spacious bedrooms, and a gorgeous, sun-drenched living area. stunning as well as homely - huge beds, walk-in wardrobes and lots of hanging and drawer space.\\nwell-located - 10-15 minute walk to bart, and short walk to dolores park, valencia st shops and bi-rite. even enterprise car rental is within walking distance.\\nzoe herself is a fabulous host. she stayed home especially to take delivery of a cot we had rented for our son ahead of arrival, and checked everything was ok several times during our stay.\\ngo ahead and book it!we had a lovely time with our toddler staying in zoe\\'s place in the mission. the location is ideal--close to restaurants, shops, parks. zoe did a fabulous job of making helpful recommendations and ensuring we had everything we needed to get set up (installed a baby gate, organized cleaners for us, left restaurant recommendations, etc.) zoe was responsive by phone to any queries we had during our stay and was a very pleasant and thoughtful host. the apartment is well maintained and we felt right at home in it. thanks zoe!amazing host - couldn\\'t ask for better!  zoe was very prompt in her communications (literally only a few hours max to respond to any email!), very considerate of guest needs (eg installing stair gate for our toddler without even asking her!, offering to forward packages if they don\\'t arrive in time etc), and overall extremely warm & friendly.  zoe goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and at home!

\\n\\nonly regret is not having had much time to spend at her place as we were at work most of the day. wow! where to even start?! zoe\\'s apartment is simply beautiful, immaculate, and full of gorgeous artwork and furniture that is nothing short of inspiring. not only that but it\\'s in the very heart of the awesome mission district but on a lovely quiet street - literally the location cannot be beat. plus super friendly neighbours downstairs who were more than happy to help with any questions and have the greatest dog, peanut, who is a total sweetheart (not to forget rabbit the cat, also a little cutie!).\\r\\n\\r\\nbut most of all i was lucky enough to meet zoe and she is just one of the most loveliest people i\\'ve ever met! after finding out that i was on my own for the last couple of days of my work trip stay, over halloween weekend, she took me under her wing and i ended up having one of the best sf weekends of my life!

neighbourhoods.\\r\\ncommunication was very easy.great host.  great place!i absolutely loved staying at carter & kaleen\\'s apartment! it\\'s within walking distance from the 24th street bart station, but be warned that it\\'s more than a 10 minute walk and some of it can be pretty steep. i do not recommend walking if you have heavy suitcases.  \\n\\nthe apartment itself is spacious, very well designed and comes with an amazing view of the city. they\\'re currently building an outdoor deck for the apartment which i have no doubt will be as amazing as the apartment is itself. the welcome

comfortable couches, very comfortable bed, and a well appointed kitchen. \\n\\nkaleen and carter were the nicest hosts. they gave me a tour of the space and were very responsive and attentive. i loved

the apartment. \\n\\ni definitely recommend staying here if you\\'re looking for a more relaxed sf experience.\\ncarter went above and beyond to make me feel welcome when i was in town for work. some snacks and bagels, bottled water in the fridge, and a chalkboard of recommendations for eateries in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home itself was immaculate. charming, personal, and super clean. i\\'ve tried to book his place again, but he\\'s understandably in demand, so if you have the chance to book it, go for it!we had a wonderful time enjoying carter\\'s apartment in portrero hill. my only regret is that we didn\\'t stay longer!\\n\\nthe location was great - right off the 101 and very easy to find. there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance and there\\'s a market

his wife went out of their way to make sure we had a good stay. when we arrived, they had dog treats, as well as a food and water dish for huck, which was so thoughtful. they let huck have the run of their backyard, even letting him hang out with their three sweet dogs while i was at work during the day. i couldn\\'t have asked for a better stay, and both huck and i left feeling like we\\'d been on vacation. they truly went above and beyond, and i hope to stay again soon!we had a great stay here. super comfortable, the backyard patio was really a nice addition and carter was a great host. he

corner. the mission/24th street bart stop is about a 10 minute walk away. all in all - perfect!\\r\\ncarter and kaleen were warm and welcoming. there were beers in the refrigerator and bagels and cream cheese for breakfasts and lunches.\\r\\nwe will definitely return!a very spacious and beautifully decorated apartment. carter was one of the most attentive host we have had in 18 months of airbnb. so many nice touches in his home and he could not have been more helpful. thanks thumbs up. enjoyable staywe felt right at home in carter\\'s place.  his urban oasis is clean, comfortable, and cozy.  each room is so tastefully done: great taste.  the extra bed in the living room is very convenient.  we especially appreciated its proximity to the mission district just a few blocks away.  because carter gave us a later checkout, we were able to enjoy much more time exploring that part of the city.  and thank you for sending us the jacket that was left behind.  hope we can stay there again in the future.the apartment is amazing!\\r\\nvery spacious, with designer furniture everywhere and all the good amenities.\\r\\nthe high-quality shampoo and body wash were also *really* nice.\\r\\nand the location was great.\\r\\nwe enjoyed every second we stayed in it.beautiful place in a great location. the host was responsive and non-intrusive. i\\'d love to stay here again.me and 3 friends flew to san francisco for a beautiful winter time trip and stayed at jays\\' beautiful home. everything was epic from the most beautiful furniture and appliances and most comfortable a bed and comforting showers. the hot tub was a beautiful way to end an evening. the house was surprisingly bigger in person then i expected. such a central location with easy access to anything you need. i highly recommend this home for any friends or family who want a luxurious trip to san francisco. will definitely use this home again for a future visit . clean, fresh, and welcoming. thank you again for an epic trip.this is an exquisite proper with the most attention to detail by the owners of any place i have ever stayed. they are attentive, fast to respond, and concerned about guest comfort. i wish all airbnb hosts were this way, they set the gold standard.the listing description was very accurate - even better than the pictures.  a nice bottle of wine greeted us at the place.  the beds were very comfortable and the shower was nice.  great location also.wonderful place, all in very good taste. fully equipped, clean and comfortable for a family of 6. the host is super responsive and helpful. great location. lovely home and super responsive host (including when we locked ourselves out!). pictures were very accurate. one small disappointment -- no steam shower though it was in the description (appeared to be locked). but overall had a great stay!we had a brief (but very relaxing) staycation in jay\\'s home. it\\'s beautifully designed, large, with high ceilings and bright light. the kitchen and dining space is perfect for dinner with friends, the couch is perfect for a good movie night--the tv is even equipped with netflix! the rooms are spacious and the beds are super comfortable. not to mention the spa-like shower in the master bedroom. the hot tub in the large backyard is also a huge plus. lastly, this place is in a prime location. next to some of the best restaurants in the city. highly recommend staying here with a large group!jay and serena made us feel extremely welcome! even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy. when i first arrived, i didn\\'t know the wifi password and had a question about the tv. i gave them a call and they generously helped me right away. the apartment is absolutely beautiful and looked even better than the pictures. \\r\\nthey also let us check in around noon because our flight arrived early. that way, we weren\\'t stranded in san francisco with all of our bags. i would stay here again, and i highly recommend this to anyone looking for an absolutely gorgeous, high end, spacious, comfortable house in sf. thanks again to both serena and jay!incredible host, amazing property, great location...  \\r\\nif you get the chance to stay here take it.  i truly did not want to leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe were in the city for business but when we came back to jay\\'s flat it felt like a vacation.\\r\\n\\r\\nall around best experience! \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat house in an incredible location. the kitchen is a dream, and the master bedroom shower is a wonderful luxury. the house has every amenity one could need, and the hosts are super responsive and clearly communicate. i would stay there again in a heartbeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hot tub was unfortunately not filled at that time, but i\\'m sure it will be good to go soon!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only thing to note, which is clearly described in the review, is that parking is a bit challenging in this area. as long as you have a solution for that this is definitely the house you should stay at in the mission.jay was great! very accommodating and extremely flexible given the tight time restraints i had. place was beautiful and everyone loved their stay. thanks! the apartment was perfect. what a great space! light and spacious, and beautifully furnished. we loved our stay. the location is amazing right, you are right in the action. the apartment was really quiet though you would have no idea you were right in the heart of the mission. would definitely love to stay again!everything went off without a hitch! the place was right in the middle of everything in the mission - couldn\\'t have asked for a better location, or a nicer place to stay. the master bath is phenomenal.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis place completely exceeded our expectations. the flat is absolutely beautiful, with a warm, mid-century design. the location was great. it was located right in the heart of the busy mission area, but it felt quiet and secluded inside and in the amazing backyard. the host made everything easy. the only downside is parking is tricky, but we were able to find metered spots within a couple blocks of the flat. i would definitely stay here again!myself and 2 co-workers stayed here and it was fantastic. it\\'s a beautifully designed apartment. i lived in sf for 10 years and know the area (url hidden) a great location for access to transit & nightlife / shopping.this apartment surpassed our expectations. it is beautiful. gorgeous furnishings, spotlessly clean, thoughtful layout, great lighting, lovely linens and comfortable beds. the location is fantastic - close to good transportation, steps away from fun and interesting restaurants, bookstores and shops. it was such a nice place to come back to after days spent in more touristy areas. the shower in the master bedroom is outstanding! we stayed with three kids who loved everything about it, including the proximity to urban putt, the park, and bi-rite ice cream. we carried out from beretta, downstairs, one night, and highly recommend it. i would say without any hesitation to stay there. also thank you to serena for such great communication throughout our stay!not only was the flat fantastic, the host\\'s service was excellent. we ran into a few \"user error\" snags and received timely assistance. the design, finishes, and amenities are top notch while meshing well with the history of the home. all with a comfortable and welcoming feel. big pluses were the hot tub, sonos surround speakers, and espresso machine. the area has lots to offer as well. long term parking was difficult but we managed to find spots both west and east outside of metered/2-hour limits (10-15 min walk). we really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. jay\\'s apartment was really spacious and well appointed. the hot tub is fabulous. we didn\\'t meet jay but he gave all the info we needed about the house. when we checked in, the place wasn\\'t that clean. we reported it and jay sent someone to clean the day after. the location is perfect, close to everything. we really enjoyed our stay there!this home in the mission was perfect for me and my coworkers! it\\'s a lovely home with plenty of room for 3-4 people, with a ton of outdoor space. i wish we could have stayed longer!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe 2 rooms that face the street can be on the noisy side, but there are ear plugs in the master bathroom. i had a white noise app that worked well to block out the noise.this place was great - the photos don\\'t do it justice, it was a really awesome spot. everything was easy and straightforward. thanks for the stay! the place is fabulous. truly amazing. exceeded expectations. visited san francisco with family for four days. really enjoyed the stay. everyone had plenty of space.  great access to mission district and easy access to transit. owner was extremely accommodating and even had a bottle of wine waiting on us. home was very nicely decorated with many unique features - lots of space, yet very cozy. great place to stay in san francisco.  mission area had plenty of places to eat and shop.  close to downtown and easy access to everything we needed via bart or uber.  host was very responsive to all requests. beautiful house. great location. host was prompt and responsive to questions. i would stay here again in a heartbeat!was very convenient to my meetings at the convention center. nice room with private bath. client was a very nice host and helpful.listing description is accurate. the host was professional, helpful and welcoming. the house was better than described. beautiful quiet location. host was very welcoming and accommodating. met a great bunch of people, can\\'t wait to come back!great host and amazing house!i thought that staying at a place with a bunch of strangers would be scary/weird/unpleasant, but i was wrong :d\\ni spent an amazing time with awesome friends. the house is very cozy , quite, and has positive vibes. we had weekly family dinners & movie nights :d \\ni really enjoyed my time, thanks to vic, eric, kevin, tyler, beau, rajeev, allison, paul, valentin, and phil!great time. i already stayed there two more times.to notch. a+ across the board. i loved the space - very relaxing and peaceful. the neighbourhood is quiet and lots of parks nearby. plenty of space to work in the house, and good amenities - laundry, coffee, fridge, and the likes.vic was very accommodating and prompt with his communication.  he  reached out as soon as our reservation was made to introduce himself, provided transportation details a week ahead of our trip, and followed up the day we arrived to ensure we had everything we needed!i loved my stay at the hackerhome! i was skeptical about sharing the room and house with so many others, but i made amazing friends during my stay and now see them all the time! the space was always kept clean, and it was super easy to get around (the 6 and 7 buses stop one block away) and you can\\'t beat the views!! everything i needed was available, even laundry detergent and little space heaters! just be warned, there is a flight of stairs you need to climb with your luggage. vic was always extremely responsive if there was a problem with anything at the house, and for me, it was the perfect introduction to the city: a vibrant international real community.simply put - vic & the hackerhouse are amazing.  highly recommend!our experience at ken and natallie\\'s place was great! \\r\\nthey are very friendly and helpful. they were very responsive to our questions prior to arriving and during our stay, providing many helpful advices to enjoy the city (interesting deals and places to visit). they were also kind enough to take care of our luggage for a week while we were on vacation in las vegas, after our stay. \\r\\nthe place is a lower unit and is very comfortable and modern as it was renovated very recently. it has a very helpful remote home security system. the door can be locked/unlocked with a mobile application and the temperature can be controlled and programmed with the same application. everything that we needed was there: a very big and modern fridge, dryer/washing machine, two big closets, two comfortable sofas, etc although the most incredible thing was the 70\" tv with subscription to netflix that you can also use to do presentations in case you have a meeting at home. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is also very convenient. there are 3 different buses very close to the apartment that you can take to reach the center, a bart station is 15 minutes walking and the us highway 101, which goes directly to silicon valley, is very near.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you are looking for a convenient location and a comfortable place to stay in sf, definitely this is a great option! \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you ken and natallie for making our stay perfect! after using airbnb for my trips to california for over two years, this is by far the best experience i had. this multimillion dollar modern sf house is absolutely great. high quality materials and furnishings (all new), super clean and equipped with every imaginable amenity, it \"radiates\" comfort, warmth and sophistication. jess is an absolutely amazing host. from refrigerator filled with delicious breakfast essentials to being almost immediately available for any questions and communications. absolute luxury, absolute 5 stars all the way (if there was a way to give more, i would). thank you so very much jess and i hope you will let me come back in the future!lovely home. perfect for our multigenerational family. the beautiful kitchen, dining area and living room layout were very conducive to our family reunion & interaction. well equipped kitchen with top appliances & complete guides for use of all equipment. nicely furnished with comfortable sofas, attractive furniture, etc. \\r\\nluxurious master bathroom suite and extra bathrooms on each floor. \\r\\nwe had privacy on each of the four floors; from the master suite on the top floor we didn\\'t hear noise from the media/play room on the bottom floor.  the 2 little children in our family enjoyed playing with the toys that the host child generously offered for our use. lots of windows with great treetop views giving openness & light with privacy.\\r\\ngood communication with friendly host and neighbor who met us at the house.  great home.  very nice experience for our family.from the beginning of the booking process, jess was very responsive and accommodating.  the house is lovely, large, extremely comfortable -- exactly as pictured.  miriam met us at check in and gave us a very friendly and thorough orientation.  jess left a nice welcome note and some eggs, sausage and champagne.  the layout was perfect for our group of three families -- we were each able to take a floor and have our private space, while coming together in the common areas.  the house was extremely clean and full of high-end details (loved the radiant heat floors!).  it is also so well equipped for those with small children -- lots of toys and books generously shared with guests.  and the movie projector was awesome for staying in on chilly nights.  glen park is a cute neighborhood, both urban and accessible and close to miles of trails.  we had a couple of minor issues (ants fleeing the rain and not-so-hot water in one of the showers) that jess offered to call in professional help for, but we opted not to take her up on that given how relatively short our stay was.  highly recommend! this has absolutely been my best airbnb experience i\\'ve ever had! jess was an awesome host from the beginning to the end of our interaction. she was extremely responsive to any questions throughout the booking process. on arrival, she had a welcome bottle of wine waiting for us. the house itself is simply gorgeous! there were 10 of us in the house and there was plenty space for everyone. again, the house itself is a beautiful work of art, i definitely had some serious house envy. i did not want to leave. i actually contemplated a return trip to sf so i could spend some more time in the house. it is very centrally located to sf downtown and to the airport. i can keep going, but there was absolutely no downside to our stay. if you are looking for a booking for a large group in sf, it does not get much better than this. thanks jess!jess was incredibly responsive and helpful before we arrived. she welcomed us with goodies and thoughtful gifts for the kids! when my mother asked if there was an ironing board, jess showed up with one a few hours later. honestly, it was better than staying in a luxury hotel and we couldn\\'t imagine a more perfect place as our home base in san francisco.my trip at jess\\'s place was great, new model house with a lot of living area. my family loves it. the location is great too, could drive straight to downtown by high way. will definitely visit sf again.jess is really great! she was really helpful and went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. the house information package was really informative and there was a lovely note to greet us.  \\r\\nthe house was roomy and homey, it made us want to stay inside all day long and just relax. the home appliances were top notch complemented with a great home entertainment system. it is definitely the perfect place to have a relaxing time in san francisco. i have done extensive traveling and stayed in some of the finest hotels, but i can honestly say that i have never felt more welcome than my family and i did in this home. jess met me on the day of \"check in\" with miriam, one of her neighbors, and reviewed all of the many amazing features in her home (and believe me, it is a techie/gadget lovers paradise!) she even bought us some initial groceries, a beautiful bouquet of flowers, and gave us a gift card for the canyon market (one of the nicest markets in the country). we were using this home as a family gathering, with four generations staying under the same roof. jess knew that we would have several young children with us, and made sure that we had every amenity to make her home \"kid- friendly.\"  she provided an amazing amount of children\\'s activities,  toys, and supplies (stroller, high chair, pack and play, etc.). in addition to being kid-friendly, this spacious house is a paradise for grown-up kids!  with the media room, gourmet kitchen, and beautiful master tub and bathroom- stocked with toiletries, even the most discerning adults have reason to be pleased. she truly opened up her gorgeous and immaculate home to us and i am forever grateful.  i hated to leave!  i hope to get the family together soon and be able to stay here again. \\r\\ni loved staying in the castro at katie and chris\\' place!  they were out of town and was unable to meet them in person, but their place has their personality all over it.  the bed was extremely comfortable, plenty of towels, good working heater, amazing location.  i would highly recommend staying in their home- very clean and welcoming.the apartment is really nice, close to everything in castro and just a tram ride to many other sf attractions. parking space is available on the street. i would recomment katie\\'s and chris\\' home to people staying in sf.though the long flight of stairs was a bit intimidating for my dad who\\'s over 60, the apartment is spacious with high ceilings and lots of natural light. katie and chris were available for any questions and super ready to help when we couldn\\'t figure out the stove.\\r\\ni\\'ve already decided they will be my go to place for whenever i\\'m in san francisco! i loved it there.i had such a great 30th birthday celebration with my dear friends at the apartment! the back yard was so quaint and a perfect place for morning mimosas! chris and katie were really easy to contact and they made cleanup practically a non issue. beds were comfortable and the house really felt like a home!chris and katie\\'s home was absolutely amazing.  chris made the stay very welcoming, told us to enjoy every aspect of the place during the stay. beautiful location, walking distance from the heart of castro. i will be keeping you guys at the top of the list for any future stay. thanks again for everything.clean and exactly as desvribed, hosts took care of everything and it was very comfortable. highly recommended! katie and chris are very responsive, friendly and easy to communicate. we never had a chance to meet but they gave us a clear, detailed instruction of check-in. and the house is really great and beautiful. great location in castro. our family enjoyed our trip in their house. highly recommended! we arrived early, so chris gave us the tour and let us drop off our bags before heading out to find delicious brunch. \\r\\n the apartment is just as beautiful as the photos, with amazing views.  it was very clean, and had everything we needed.  all the beds were comfortable, and we had plenty of blankets.\\r\\n  its a bit further down market than expected, so it was a bit of a walk to the metro line, but otherwise a great location.everything at chris and katie\\'s was wonderful. the location, although on the main thoroughfare of market street, was quiet and close to some of our favorite spots (although you have to walk a bit to the nearest store, it\\'s not that far). the space was beautifully lit, clean, and comfortable and felt very spacious for 4 of us. booking with chris and katie was very easy and they were extremely accommodating. the kitchen was very well-equipped and we were able to cook breakfast everyday during our stay. i highly recommend this apartment and it\\'s gorgeous views of the city!3 guys on a business trip with some sightseeing in our spare time requiring a functional, practical place to stay close to town is exactly what we got, on top of that we got a great view at the back of the property. chris was a great host, hospitable and happy to spend as much time as needed to guide us through the property and advice on the local area. chris was also very gracious in spite of a slight issue we caused on departure. it was quite amazing to think we were in the midst of san fran and it was so quiet. would not hesitate to re-book!english:\\nthe apartment is amazing! we are a family of five that stayed there very comfortably. it\\'s gorgeous and well located considering you can take the f streetcar located a few blocks away, that takes you all the way on market st.\\nvery clean and the beds are sooo comfortable!\\n\\nespañol:\\nel apartamento es asombroso! somos una familia de cinco y estuvimos muy cómodos en nuestra estadía. es hermoso y bien ubicado considerando que el tranvía f esta ubicado a pocas cuadras y va derecho por la calle market.\\nmuy limpio y las camas son muuuy cómodas!another amazing stay.  katie and chirs are great hosts, and the apartment was fantastic.  great communication and perfect for a weekend stay.  i look forward to staying at their place again.katie and chris\\'s appartment was delightful. and bigger than we had imagined. it really felt like a home away from home. great neighborhood, awesome view and a special vibe. thank you!chris and kate made my friends and i feel entirely welcomed!  they accommodated our late/early check in/out times, which relieved lots of stress for us.   their apartment looks exactly like the photos on the profile.  the beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious, and the views are breathtaking.  the neighborhood is located a few walking blocks from the castro.  i recommend this place!  chris made our stay easy and care free, answered questions and allowed us to check in and out on our unpredictable schedule. we never met in person but all we needed was easy to find. the beds were comfortable, even the mattress he set up in the office for the third bed, and the bedding was plush and clean. loved the comforter!\\r\\ni would gladly rent this place again, though i would refrain from bringing a german quality control engineer with me. he immediately noticed some open wiring in the bathroom and moldy wood paneling around the tub as well as the questionable construction of the wooden deck. i still sat out there to enjoy the fabulous view of the city! overall the place is over 100 years old, so it\\'s got historic charm and with it some dings that are part of the bargain i think.\\r\\nthe neighborhood is colorful as one would expect and groceries and restaurants are easy to get to on foot. the main bedroom out back is quiet, the smaller one faces market and has some traffic noise, easily countered with earplugs or beer. great apartment full of character and charm. stunning views. great neighbourhood. spacious enough for six. very comfortable beds. eclectic vinyl collection. but no hot water. for 4 days. definitely not worth the price given this major flaw. as such, none of us would consider staying here again.katie and chris\\'s place was just as shown. it was a fantastic location for sf pride. they were lovely and attentive. there was enough room to fit the three of us comfortably. we would stay here again! my colleagues and i really enjoyed staying at katie and chris\\'s. the apartment is in a great part of town, close to a lot of good restaurants and public transit, but quiet too. the view out the back windows are beautiful, and the home up twin peaks is not nearly as difficult as it looks from below. communication was always prompt, check in and out were painless, and the house was in good order. i would recommend the place.excellent location & furnishings. well positioned to see san francisco while still being quiet at night. loved it and amazing area with great restaurants a wonderful grocery store and a tram right by had a wonderful time much enjoyednever had a chance to meet katie and chris in person, but they were fantastic to deal with and had everything ready for us upon arrival.  the place has tons of room, the master bed is especially comfy, and the kitchen is roomy and has everything you need to cook meals.  we were able to walk to dinner every night and try different restaurants each time, the castro neighborhood is certainly lively and unique!  there is a set of stairs that you must use to get in and out of the apartment, so just make sure anyone staying there is cool w that.  would highly recommend to anyone looking for an affordable place in san fran that will have you feeling like a local!great neighborhood, great location, great place. chris was easy to contact and getting into the place was quick. i\\'d definitely recommend. i stayed in  serendipia nest for 1 week, place was amazing & super clean. met very smart motivated entrepreneurs. one of best places i lived in sf. all your need is there: work space, bedroom, living space where you meet friends and connect.. will diffidently come back again.  i stayed in serendipia nest for 5days.\\r\\nthere are awesome people and you can communicate with them.\\r\\nlouis also very kindly. i\\'ll miss you guys.:)\\r\\nthe place is good to go downtown and piers.\\r\\nif i\\'ll visit sf again, i\\'ll stay here. :)talk about “the hostess with the mostest”.  jennifer is such a warm, gracious, generous and wonderful host.   the house is so warm and inviting, and you truly feel that you are home the minute you walk in the door.   we love staying here and will certainly be back.  \\r\\nif you are a bibliophile, you will never want to leave!  but, if you do leave, everything you need is a walk away.  perfect location.  perfect host. \\r\\nwe spent another fabulous week at jennifer’s home, and enjoyed it even more than the first time.  we were able to enjoy the deck and gorgeous english garden, and enjoy the other rooms and nooks for cozy lounging and relaxing.  jennifer was always a text or call away, but everything was so easy that we never had worry.   catching the latest foreign language film a few short blocks away and then curling up with one of jennifer’s hundreds of books is pretty close to heaven.\\r\\nlove this house and host.    excellent owner timely responses to any questions.\\r\\naccurate house description.\\r\\nexcellent neiborhood.\\r\\nvery comfortable house with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms.\\r\\noverall experience 5 stars.beautiful house with a great location. zest an made it easy to check-in and grab the keys. the place was lived in but all the tenants left their space clean and ready for rental. overall couldn\\'t have asked for a better setup. thanks again for everything.the host canceled this reservation 98 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we had a wonderful stay over the historical super bowl at this suite! beautifully decorated and homey, clean and very professional. check in was very easy and we had a lovely well stocked kitchen which was an added plus! the only issue i had was that we were three people and i thought there were two beds, in fact one was a pull out couch but it was not made up for the extra person and we could not locate extra bedding so i had to sleep on top of the couch with a borrowed sheet from the master bedroom! still even with the lumpy sleep it was a nice stay.it was a wonderfull experience to be at greg\\'s place. greg helped us a lot around the neighbourhood and even we checked out already he still wanted to help us with our travels! although we paid for a shared room he let us use his full appartment and made some plans to give us our privacy too! the location is perfect as well, nice restaurants, next to the entrance of golden gate park and less then 5 minute walk to the beach!! if you want to experience some san francisco beach time, greg is the perfect host and his place makes sure you will not forget what its like to live at the beach!i got lucky and was able to use the garage parking.  i liked having a spot to come and go and not worry about street parking.  close to golden gate park and within a gold driving distance of pier 39 and the golden gate bridge.  greg is a really cool guy and his dog, heath, is super friendly and mellow. the location to the beach and golden gate park were amazing, plus it was a block away from the n train, so a super easy commute to market st. there are a ton of amazing laid back restaurants and i\\'m so glad to have enjoyed this part of san francisco! thanks greg and heath!!we had a really fun and interesting week! eventually we even ended up making a stop motion film with lexies adorable daughter. thank you for always making such an effort, lexie!it is a very pleasant experience living with lexie. she is very nice, considerate and helpful. the neighborhood is quite and safe, and there are even quite some nice chinese restaurants nearby.  the bart station is only 15minutes\\' walk, and it\\'s very convenient to go to downtown by the bart (only 4 stops to civic center).\\nlexie\\'s lovely gifts for our two kids are really a big surprise and they like them very much! thank you, lexie.we spent only one night there, but lexie was so helpfull.\\r\\nwe really liked it!a very pleasant experience! everything was as promised, nice neighborhood with many places to eat around; not far from public transport. very friendly and helpful host - lexie gave us some suggestions about what to see in the city and was so kind to lend us some warmer jackets when san francisco weather caught us unaware! thank you for hosting us!lexie\\'s apartment was very eclectic and clean. she was very friendly and willing to help me navigate the city. i enjoyed my time there! lexie is a passion host, always make guest fun, we were enjoy be there . \\nthanks lexie.lexie was great! can\\'t say how much we enjoyed staying with her. she helped us alot during our traveling in sf. with affordable house, good location and the best host this is the best place to be in! 5/5 for lexie!my family in sf. lexie, a beloved mother and friend. the coolest woman i ever met!!!! i hope i can stay there and live with them for longer. we drink and talk a lot. she got a wonderful house and a really smart girl. keep in touch.  i\\'ll come back and visit again! we had a short but amazing stay at lexie\\'s beautiful place. everyone was really welcoming. thank you!amazing. lexie is so kindly. we had a great time. lexi is very easy, relaxed and helped us out whenever we needed.\\nquiet place and only 30 min to downtown by train.lexi was so sweet! what a wonderful host. the room was perfect for the 3 of us and she has an incredible back garden. would definitely recommend.lexis is very easy and helpful. she provided us with a map and many information to go through the city.how to say (url hidden) like home.\\r\\n\\r\\nlexie love to speak with everyone, to help you and give advice. the place is very quiet. you can go to downtown by bus (30min) or by car (but the park is very expensive)\\r\\n\\r\\nwe spoke about music, tv shows and other stuff. it\\'s a lovely place with lot of stuff but you feel like home\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again and hope you see sooni traveled to san francisco with my girlfriend and her friend and we had the pleasure of staying with lexie. as a host, she\\'s very pleasant and eccentric. she is not nosy and lets you do your thing while being helpful and accommodating. \\n\\nher house is as eccentric as the host. it\\'s located a little out of the way away from the hustle and bustle but near a bus stop which will take you to the city or a bart if you need to travel. there\\'s also lyft and uber for additional modes of transport which is what we used. we didn\\'t drive so we didn\\'t notice the parking situation but i can imagine it being difficult. \\n\\nthe room we stayed in seemed perfectly suited for our situation. there was a pullout sofa for my girlfriend and i with another futon type sofa for the friend. i wish the pullout sofa was a little more comfortable, but it is a pull out sofa so you can\\'t expect too much from that. there was also a single person air mattress that we did not use, but i\\'m not sure there was space after we had the sofa pulled out. the room also had a tv with not too many channels as well as lots of random books if you need a little entertainment. the room could have used an air freshener or something to help counter the smell of the pets roaming the premises, but it wasn\\'t too overbearing for me. \\n\\nthey only have one shower, but we never had issues being able to use it. the bathroom is very clean and we were supplied with ample amounts of towels. \\n\\nwe did not use the kitchen too much, but it did appear to be fully functional, as advertised. there is a microwave for quick meals, but when we used it, we noticed it could use a bit of cleaning. also, if you plan on bringing a lot of groceries, the fridge was pretty packed. luckily for us, we spent most of our meals out enjoying what the city had to offer. \\n\\noverall, the place was decent. it provided us everything we needed at a reasonable rate with a very helpful host. in addition, i appreciated that she printed out some tickets for us when we had no other means. it was also nice to know she would have let us keep our bags there past our checkout so we could continue to wander around town. staying with lexie was super accommodating and her home is very eclectic and cool. you feel like you are right at home so for us it was a great break from staying in a hotel or camping out. lexie offered us advice on where to go, a map to plan out our stay, and an overall pleasant experience in san fran. not to mention, her place is in a great location. thanks again lexie!nice stay with lexie!  \\r\\nthanks tom help me looking for the parking spot!lexi is very kind and accommodating. she has great stories and a fun eclectic home.

communicate. two quiet and cool cats, one of which rarely showed up. the room is quite big. two sofa beds. extra air mattresses are provided. enough for 4 people but may be small for 5 or more. public transportation is very convenient. the last night of our stay we really had a magic time with  lexie.  lexie is a great, energetic host and made us feel very welcome and at home. she knows her way around the city and offered good advice on how to visit san francisco. her house is also incredibly unique, filled with eclectic relics and decorations.  the area we were in was definitely quiet compared to the more popular parts of the city. parking is a little rough if you\\'re driving.lexie was welcoming and helpful. we had a good experience in her home. the room is not big, but it is very comfortable. i will recommend her place considering the fair price.lexie is now family!  as this trip was a busy one with family and business, i enjoyed her home, personality and the privacy.  it felt like home! \\r\\n\\r\\nit was within walking distance to the bus, which is a lovely ride to downtown, and not too far from the bart.  great food in the neighborhood and child friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe

to have a wonderful time in a wonderful city.we had a really nice stay at lexie\\'s place. the neighborhood was quiet. the room had plenty of space for three persons. the beds were comfortable and clean. lexie is a very cheerful person. she greeted us on arrival and explained to us the different ways to go to many sf venues. transportation facilities are located near. you can take the 14l bus for a direct access to downtown sf. definitely a good place for a nice shot-term visit of san francisco.lexis is an amazing host. once we arrived after a brief hick-up; everything went smoothly. the front house was spacious and roomy enough for my friends and i. everything in her ad is promised. we all enjoyed our stay with lexie and would reccomend her spacious front room house. she gave us a map that helped us get around. my siblings and i had a great experience staying at lexie\\'s. sleeping arrangements were comfortable. the space is perfect for 4. getting around by public transportation was pretty easy as well. she\\'s also walking distance to walgreens/cvs and restaurants, which made it easy if we need to pick up something small. i would definitely stay again!lexie is a welcoming and enthusiastic host with truly eclectic taste!  the beds were comfortable and we slept well;  i enjoyed perusing her bookshelves and art collection, as well as getting to know her a bit!!  the garden is beautiful and relaxing.fantastic place! my families all enjoyed the stay. the host lexie is really nice! i should try the tent next time :)our stay from lexie was very nice,\\r\\nthe house is not in the center (which for a city like san francisco is the best) but it is very well connected and public transports are very efficients.\\r\\nlexie is a very kind person and very interesting: it has provided a lot of information on how to make our stay as pleasant and told us many things about the city and life in america in general.\\r\\nwant to live a real experience in san francisco? you have to stay with lexie and enjoy her amazing backyard!lexie\\'s place is located in a quiet and convenient neighborhood with a few good places for breakfast. traveling around the city was convenient with the bus just a few blocks away. lexie provided us with a map of san frans that was really useful. my family is super grateful towards lexie for driving us from and to the airport!  apartments has its unique atmosphere. lexie is very friendly person, whose hospitality we enjoyed. highly recommend.lexie made us feel very welcome. she is very easy-going and fun to talk to. we enjoyed communicating with her. she helped us with parking, some computer-related issues, gave a map of sf and excellent tips where to go. the place was great, it was spacious and four of us were very comfortable there. the bathroom is great, nothing to complain about.  we had a great time there , my family and i, we love lexie, she is so kind and helpful! the place is nice with convenient location to take a bus to the city center and there are markets and restaurants around! hope we can be there again! we stayed at lexies place for 2 nights and it was really a great experience. she provided very helpful advice for our time in sfo. our kids enjoyed playing with lexies daughter and the guest room is very cozy. although the house is located in the south of the city you can reach the city center comfortable and quickly by express bus. we hope to come back some day!\\nmichael and family from munichgreat house and nice host. \\r\\nit takes 40-50 mins to get to downtown by bus or bart, so i will highly recommend to rent a car instead.lexie never failed to make us laugh every day we stayed with her. she always kept us feeling so comfortable and at home! we loved wheezer, scooter and the cat houses haha. lexie gave us her favourite map to navigate around san francisco and useful tips to get around the city, which was super helpful! will definitely swing by in the near future! thank you for everything, lexie.very interesting place, the beds are extremely comfortable!good experience! i and my family absorbed enough warmth during that two nights by using lexie\\'s ac and heater, even though the weather in sf did not cooperate in summer lol. besides, her house is amazing, like a collection museum: lots of cute stuff to watch and play with. love that garden, love that cat and love that little girl!lexie was very welcoming and we appreciated her help with getting around san francisco and her excellent map she gives visitors. we loved her beautiful garden she has created. the accomodation was rather cramped for 4 people and seemed overpriced for what it had to offer. we had a very pleasant stay at lexie\\'s! it was only for a night but she was very accommodating and friendly. she also communicated very well right from the start. thank you again!lexie is really welcoming and enthusiatic towards every guest. once we arrived she used an hour to introduce us sf and gave us very useful information. the room is large and comfortably accomodate 4 of us. the cat is adorable and it sometimes goes to your room and sleep on your bed. unfortunately in the first two days, the toilet has broken and it is a bit inconvenient, and the kitchen is not in its best condition as well so we didnt cook. the public transport there is a bit inconvenient though, and it is quite far away from the tourist spots. but overall we have a good stay in lexie\\'s place. feels like home.we had a nice stay at lexies and her daughter. her room was perfect for a family with kids. her neighbourhood is almost tourist-free and super nice.  we experienced a very open-minded, friendly and helpful host.lexie is very passionated,  nice and helpful. even we arrived late, she still helped us to sort out our travel information.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room is also great, i love it so much! definitely will recommend to friends and will stay here again on next visit!lexie went above and beyond to accommodate us. very courteous of our privacy in the front room, but always available to help and provide. disregard any negative reviews, we will definitely be back!we\\'re a family of four, and we stayed for three nights. excellent value--the guest room worked really well for us. there\\'s readily available street parking, which is amazing for san francisco, although it\\'s about 10 blocks uphill. lexie was very welcoming and helpful, giving us lots of good advice about how to get around and being prepared for the weather. it\\'s about 45 minutes to get to the sf waterfront by bus, and about 30 minutes by car (we did both). it was also really cool walking around the neighborhood. highly recommended if you\\'re on a budget, probably not so good for older travellers because of the distance to the street parking.lexie is great,the house is cool,everything\\'s good,i love this place!lexie was a great host! she helped us getting started in sf with places to visit and how to get there. lexie is very helpful. she even offered to drive me and my friends 4 o\\'clock in the morning to help us get tickets to alcatraz! \\n\\nbut if your looking for a tidy place to live in while in sf, this might not be the place for you. we didn\\'t have a problem with it, but she has a lot of stuff in her home. the room that we lived in was great though! lexie is a great host. we are very appreciative that she accepted us at last minutenice host, comfortable bed, very good experience at lexis\\' home. ps. garden is beautiful : )lexie was very nice and helpful and did everything she could to make our stay good. however this is not a house for you if you specially like your privacy, can\\'t handle a bit of messiness and having a few animals running around.i did not end up staying here due to lack of good communication. can\\'t say anything about the listing, besides communication with host is not ideal. lexie is really helpful, it\\'s a really lovely home to stay.lexie is a wonderful caring  host and provides lots of good recommendations and tips. we felt just as being at home.awesome airbnb!\\r\\nthe room was very spacious and really nice. the house had lots of interesting stuff.\\r\\nthe best part was the host: lexie was really nice and helpful. she even drove me to the airport after our stay.  we had tons of fun with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nlexie was very a very nice and offered to show a map of where to go.  we had set plans, but certainly appreciated the offer!we showed up really late. much later than expected. no matter, lexie was awesome and inviting and helpful. with magic, we found parking, settled in, and we had a fun stay. we\\'re trying out different spots and different ways to stay in san francisco, and we\\'ll definitely consider staying there again in the future. :)i had a fantastic stay at the lexie\\'s house . lexie was an amazing host, funny and very to communicate. i highly recommend this place. thanks lexie!lexie was a great host. she is nice and her daughter is cute.lexie is nice person , she is cool ,she share lots tourist details with us !\\nlexie\\'s house is lovely but too mess to me . but her picture looks so clean and tidy , so we have some disappointment after we arrive . \\n the garden we can not have fun cause too much her stuff on the path to the garden and the house and our room is not as clean as her pictures are . she really carry lots of cool things , buts seems it make the house really mess . we had a nice stay in lexie\\'s house. she was very welcoming and helpful. we used the bus to get to san fransisco down town, about 30 minutes by bus. if we come back to san fransisco we would probably chose to live closer to down town to spend less time on the bus. lexie was very friendly and open. if you can not deal with artsy folk and arnt spontaneous or  you are ocd about anything, this is not the place for you. its a fun and colorful place, but a small space. no room to \"hang out\" but still nice to relax.  their were bunk beds that were comfortable. a safe place to crash.  it was really convenient to drive into the city for her house however parking is really limited so if you don\\'t feel comfortable leaving your car parked a block or two away, you would be unhappy. however she did offer to move her car for us. over all she was honest and sweet.lexie is awesome. it felt more like we were staying with friends or relatives than strangers. we had as much space as we needed and were given many insider secrets to the lovely city that we wouldn\\'t have gotten staying in a hotel. we four had a very great time at lexie\\'s place. she is really helpful, a free parking lot is just before her house, room is warm with big beds, so we had  adequate space. hot water is available. she even provided free beer and let a vacuum machine to us. so we\\'re pretty much happy, and definitely will stay at her place next time.i just wanna say me and my friends had an excellent time at lexie\\'s. she was courteous and her home is a cozy beautiful place with its own unique personality. it was our first time in san francisco and she made us feel at home. our car got towed and she even gave us a ride to the station to get it back. to be honest i have no idea how anyone could have anything negative to say about lexie. a truly rare person and i\\'m grateful for her and her family\\'s hospitality. plain and simple. lexie was so welcoming and friendly. our drive to san fransisco took longer than we anticipated and lexie stayed up until 1am to greet us, then helped me find parking in her area! incredibly friendly and hospitable.\\r\\nlexie had maps on hand to give us, and gave us a few recommendations of interesting places to go and also told us about clipper cards for public transport. her house is very close to a number of bus lines, and also only a mile from a bart station, so it was really easy to get around. she even made us all a pot of coffee on our first morning! it was definitely needed! lexie\\'s house is super eclectic, and full of colour. the bedroom we stayed in was huge; we actually fit 6 people in very comfortably! a wonderful place to stay. lexie met us with a big smile and a welcoming home in lively excelsior.  she provided us with helpful tips on sf transit and gave us recommendations and a great map to get us started in the \\'city by the bay\\'.  lexie was very cordial and within minutes i felt like we were friends and have always known each other.  our room and bathroom were exquisitely cleaned and we could tell she really enjoyed having us stay with her--always asking to make sure we had everything we needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nher taste in music and art lent itself to a creative presentation in her home; every room had a different personality.  outside, the neighborhood was alive with children and cultures of all kinds.  restaurants on every corner and convenience stores were within 2-5 minutes walking distance.  **this is a city best traveled by foot, bike or public transportation** definitely as amazing place to stay. our host was super accommodating to our very late arrival into san francisco. the room comfortable fit all 4 of us. she made sure we had all our amenities taken care of. super friendly and open host. could not ask for a better experience. awesome neighborhood. pretty quiet and close to public transportation. super sweet catch for valentines day weekend. thank you for everything!!lexie is such a nice lady. she picked us up at the airport and provide so much assistance to us.  we really enjoy ourselves in her apartment!!!lexie was awesome, as her previous reviews stated. she immediately gave us a rundown and map of the city, and was always helpful when we had questions on how to get around. she even drove us to the airport to pick up our friend, and to the rental car place at the end of our stay! very kind lady. \\r\\nwith 4 of us staying here, we had plenty of space to sleep and the bathroom was nice and clean. we loved that we were able to walk to the public transit stations, and lexie suggested some great restaurants, bookstores, and bars that made our experience super fun! it was our first time in california, and lexie was a great representative of the kind people and laid-back culture. lexi was fun and unique. the place was a bit cluttered but an easy stay in san francisco. found parking pretty easily. great time!! the hospitality was great from the start to the finish. lexie was warm and welcoming and had everything provided that she had claimed. rooms and the beds were clean, as well as the bathroom. very great sleep in a great city!lexie was a wonderful host and made us feel very much at home. it was great having a local\\'s knowledge of san francisco, and such a different view of the city than if we\\'d stayed in a hotel. thank you so much! (and we want one of those fly zapper bats!!)lexie, and her whole household, including the cats, were terrific hosts. very welcoming and open, super helpful with information about the city and neighbourhood, and genial company for a chat.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is colourful and full of interesting art, objects and books, and the wi-fi is quick and reliable. if you are a particularly fastidious traveller you may find the space a little crowded, but we enjoyed the collections, and the hamster. and the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\na really great experience for us. many thanks to lexie.the house is near the bus stop.lexie is a lovely and enthusiastic host. the house is in a decent location within 15-20 minutes walk of a bart station and a bus stop at the end of the road. the surrounding area has some great and really cheap restaurants and bars. the room itself has lots of bed space but feels a bit cluttered. if you are a clean-freak then this place is not for you but the bathroom is clean and the shower is great. overall, if you need a place just to spend the night in and shower in then this will do the job.excellent communication from the host as we approached from the airport. the room was pretty full with the four of us and the creative decorations, but lexie was there assisting us to settle in on our arrival. it was a very cosy stay for the two nights we were there. parking was a challenge at times but again lexie came to the rescue when needed. this stay left all of us with great memories.had an absolute ball staying at lexie\\'s. great to get away from the confines of the usual hotel room. this is real san francisco !!\\nlexie was a wealth of information from local eateries to scoring last minute alcatraz tickets.\\nthanks for having us at a time that was very busy in your life xx\\n\\nkeep in touch amanda and the tribe :)she was very nice and helpful. the bed was super comfortable and i\\'ll definitely come back to stay again! \\r\\nour host was very helpful in explaining how to navigate the city by public transit. the neighborhood seemed safe and the stop for a bus were only a few blocks away. the accommodations were adequate for a bare bones, inexpensive stay if that is what you\\'re looking for. a shared bathroom, not en suite if that sort of thing matters to you.it was a terrible experience for us. the biggest problem was being robbed. we have parked the car at place lexie adviced but it has been robbed. so, car parking and safety at the neighborhood is the biggest problem. the cleanliness of room and home is another matter. even if you are not obsessed about cleanliness, it might distrub you. the room practically has only two beds. the single bed is actually a couch and unconfortable for sleeping. so, if you are more than 2 adults and not couples, this will not fit for you. the window in the room is another problem, because it can not prevent the wind to come inside. so, if you do not want to catch cold, be careful in the night. the other problem that we faced with was timing. normally we expected to reach there afternoon, however we reached around 10pm and the room was still not prepared.  our family stayed with kim and greg for two nights. they are in an excellent location, right next to usf. kim was very helpful, telling us about the city and how to find different scenic attractions. we had a great visit.kim and greg are fantastic hosts. their home is centrally located and offers easy access to get around the city. they have easy street parking or parking spot in front of their house. i would recommend their place for short and long stays.\\r\\ni felt right at home!the reservation was canceled 40 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the reservation was canceled 43 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.wonderful! thank you kim & greg for opening your home to me and my daughter. the space was cozy and quiet. the off street parking prevented me from worrying about where to park. i hope to stay with you on my next visit to san francisco. check-in is typically later in the day, but kim accommodated our earlier arrival by having her husband greg show us in while kim was at work. the room is very bright, with 1 window and french doors leading to pretty backyard patio. bathroom is beautiful and living room is nice. wireless internet is provided as well as some fruit, nuts, and coffee. there were plenty of blankets and the dresser was empty. living space was as described. kim was very responsive via text message for recommendations as we toured san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nkim invited us for some tea to the upper level of her house one night where we chatted about traveling and family. she was very generous, giving us protein bars for the busy day we had planned.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe recommend staying here. playing with their french bulldog boo is very enjoyable!kim and greg are one of the kindest person i have met. they accommodated my late check-in, and my late check-out. they help me receive too many amazon\\'s shipment that i couldn\\'t imagine that there could be anyone else who can help me on this with smile. not to mention that they would have to throw away a huge pile of empty boxes for me. some of those shipment didn\\'t arrive on time, and they offered to keep them for me even before me asking for help. kim often invited me for dinner, and offered me with some fruits, snacks and tea. they have been really making me feel at home. i can only say that they are the type of people who always offer their kindness and comfort to everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nabout the house, the bedroom and the bathroom are really nice. the bedroom is belong to their eldest son before he left for college, so of course, they are very nice. the patio and the garden are beautiful. she has been super responsive to the text messages. the free parking is a huge plus. the area is very close to ucsf, so it\\'s one of the nicest, safe, and quiet area in sf. there is a bus stop nearby within a few minute walk, so i can commute downtown very easily by bus because it\\'s very troublesome finding parking spot when i need to go downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nand mr. boo (her dog) is super cute. \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ll be back at her place again if it\\'s available next time.kim and greg are wonderful hosts. they have both been so helpful and the location is great. a very safe neighbourhood and very close to all public transport. they have been so welcoming, kind and knowledgable about the area. the room itself along with the bathroom has everything you may need and of coarse there is a beautiful patio area too. thanks for a wonderful stay, i would strongly recommend this place as we felt right at home. \\r\\nkim is awesome! she even packed us snacks and left them out for us when we left for our 18 hr road trip back home.  the room was nice and breezy with french doors that open to her outside patio.  the area is filled with great restaurants and it was nice to have a parking spot at kim\\'s. kim\\'s place was great and i felt very welcomed with offers of tranport, food and courtesy.  loved the room with the patio; bed was more comfortable than i find in most hotels.  clean bathroom with nice shower.  very close to public transport.we arrived in sf with our 7month old baby in order to settle down in the city. so we booked a room at kim and greg\\'s place. they have been wonderful hosts.\\r\\nthey have given us so many tips about sf and what to do, where to live and how to do things that normally would take you weeks to learn as a new comer in a city. they helped us so much with the baby and changed the way the room, the living room and the bathroom were set-up in order to ease our stay. the garden in the backyard is so nice to have lunch and to rest.\\r\\nthe place was exactly as described. it was very clean and kim and greg were very helpful.\\r\\nwe are going to recommend kim and greg\\'s place to all our friends that are going to visit us in sf!kim is a very nice and considerate landlord, and so as her husband greg. the first time i went into the apartment, the feeling is really amazing, bright room, enough space,comfortable enviroment, nice steps and plants,  all the furnitures were made by greg himself, look so comfortable.i really love the living room which is also a reading room, there is a piano in this room,all these stuffs make me and my wife very happy. the living experience is better than i thought before. kim and greg treated us well, helped us a lot to get used to the life in sf. the apartment\\'s location is quite nice, 10 mins driving to golden gate bridge, 1 mins walk to a main road, geary blvd, and very close to some shopping area, all kinds of restaraunt around the house. sf city univesity is also 5 mins walking distance, i like wandering in the college. kim raised a very cute dog named boo, who brought a lot of fun to us as well.   unforgetable experience in this house, if i could, i would choose the house again! dana was a wonderful host and staying at her home felt like staying in my own home.  the home (and it is more like a home than a house) was charming clean and comfortable.  proximity to the park is great.  thanks dana for making my family feel so wonderful over the winter holidays.we had a lovely stay at this home.  it was clean, spacious and comfortable.  we especially enjoyed the roof top terrace.  dana was an incredibly responsive host -- even in the early morning hours she quickly responded to us when our children locked us out of the master bedroom!  the guest bedroom bed was sofa bed and not the most comfortable, but the rest of the beds - 4 more in total - were great.  we were a party of 8 (4 adults and 4 kids) and so to have a fully-equipped kitchen, laundry room, and three full bathrooms was ideal.  also, \"checking in\" and \"checking out\" was very easy.  we would stay there again!great place!  we used it for an offsite - it was perfect - big enough to spread out and do work.  great light, internet was strong.ayelet is a very nice host. understanding and friendly. everything was perfectwe had great experience at this house! not only was it very clean and spacious, but ayelet was very accommodating. she checked up on us via text to make sure we had everything we needed. we would definitely recommend this space for family gatherings! the home was well large and well located near golden gate park. it was easy and convenient to get down town or get out of the city. hosts were nice and helpful. house is big with independent space. location is great as well.beautiful home and over accommodated our group---which was so nice to have that much space.   amazing location and great host.  we will use again next year for our run\\n\\nayelet was very professional and excellent at communicating rapidly.  we enjoyed her property and it served our needs perfectly!the listing description was mostly accurate though we would have liked to know that one of the bedrooms was in the basement and far removed from the other four. cool area, great place to stay. very clean and comfortable, with easy parking. we really liked the common area in the dining room that ended up being a great place to do work and chat. really good communication from ayelet as well.the house was perfect. we had 8 girls and everyone was comfortable and had a great time!we loved our experience with ayelet\\'s home. it was so clean, comfortable and the perfect amount of space for our group.  booking was easy as well as communication with host. we couldn\\'t have asked for a better experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe will most definitely be booking here again for our next trip! the host was very easy to deal with and check up on us about half way through our stay. the house was amazing for the most part. we wish we would have been told about the down stairs bedrooms. they have a master and a big room with 3 other beds. but for privacy reasons this may not fit others needs. the location is amazing it is in the middle of everything you want to do. shopping sight seeing everything.  kitchen is fully stocked so you have the option of cooking. really cool views at night and in the day. would defiantly consider staying again if we ever visit san fran again.some friends and i visited for a concert. the location was great and the space was big enough to accomidate our group of six. ayet was very friendly. she gave us our space but was available if we needed anything. overall we had a great experience and i would highly recommend this rental.a mixed bag\\r\\na. great location with easy walking distance to golden gate park, many good restaurants   within walking distance, and a short walk to trolley/bus stop with direct routes to downtown.\\r\\nb. lovely master bathroom (see photo)\\r\\nc. host provided half a dozen items for grandkids in fridge to help with arriving after 16 hour flight. much appreciated.\\r\\nd. lovely kitchen with wine cooler, but very poorly equipped for actual cooking. example, no sauce pan to boil eggs\\r\\ne.  access to second queen size bed was most limited. through a narrow staircase without railing and through a garage under repair (see photos). too dangerous to navigate for small children and/or senior citizen wife. was clear on who we were when booked and enquired about access.  son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren had to sleep in separate rooms in single beds\\r\\nf. in general, furnishings were spartan. probably a great booking for college students looking for a weekend space\\r\\nmay have been \"spoiled\" with superb experiences in previous bookings that were not met here.we had a very nice stay. the location is awesome. ayelet was super friendly and helpful! thanksying and her sister were great hosts! very friendly and considerate. the apartment is much nicer than the photos even. location is convenient in soma, close to the caltrain station and not a far walk from 2 supermarkets.  all in all a great place with really cool hosts!ying is a great host. she is very kind and bear me with coming around 11pm. the place is very clean and looks much better than the picture. if i goto the city i would definitely choose her place again.ying\\'s apartment was great -- the pictures on airbnb don\\'t do it justice!

sad to say goodbye to sf.the apartment was as described.  nice and clean.at our arrival the host welcomed us kindly. but there was an issue with the cleaning - at check-in time we found the apartment not yet ready and we had to share it with the cleaners during their work). then the cleaning was not very accurate and we had to complete it ourselves. we complained with the host but unfortunately he refused to acknowledge the inconvenience we had, so from that time on the interaction was not in very kindly terms any more. \\r\\nwe had two little children with us, and the house - a nice and well furnished one, for the rest - turned out to be not very suitable for them (steep unprotected stairs). however the neighborhood is quiet and the apartment benefits from some enjoyable outside space.the reservation was canceled 9 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the unit was very comfortable, clean and well appointed. nice sheets, lush towels and comfortable beds. we didn\\'t use the kitchen much but everything you would need was available. the apartment has enough furnishings to be comfortable but plenty of room to unpack. jason was very responsive to any questions we had, texting back immediately and offering his assistance if needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is convenient and near cafes, shops and public transportation. a short walk takes you to the mission and the main shopping street on 24th in noe valley. and even though on street parking is certainly not easy in sf, we had little trouble finding somewhere to squeeze in.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is a washer/dryer in the unit that is not currently functional, although there is a free w/d in the basement. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe loved the place and would gladly rent it again. thanks jason!jason was an amazing host.  first of all he was responsive to any questions or issues we had, which were slim to none but he was available in case we needed anything.  they location was great because we could walk out furry friend right outside to use the restroom.  there was a sports bar on the corner that we went to one night and a coffee shop down one block for the mornings!

comfortable in every aspect. jason was very responsive to this newbie\\'s many questions. check in was so easy with the electronic access. favorite part for us? the breakfast nook lured us each day to play cards, relax and have several meals. jason\\'s home was clean, welcoming, well designed and furnished. it\\'s also close to mission district which is buzzing with night life. he was more than willing to host my friends and i at the last minute and we had absolutely no issues from our end. \\n\\nps - the biomat is definitely one to check out ;)!our family of 4 had a great stay at jason\\'s apartment. it was clean, bright, and airy, with plenty of room for us all to stay comfortably.  although we did not cook, everything is there in the beautiful kitchen to cook a gourmet meal. we arrived early and jason facilitated an early check-in, which let us get on with our vacation as soon as we arrived. although groceries and excellent ice cream are right near by, this apartment is far enough from the \"24th street corridor\" of noe valley that it\\'s a bit far to walk. muni streetcar and bus are both around the corner, and make for easy access to the rest of the city. overall a great experience!our family of 5 had a great stay of 3 weeks at jason\\'s apartment this february 2016 during for winter holidays. we arrivend early and there were some misunderstanding for check in but later it was fine. the appartment is clean, bright, and airy, with plenty of room for us all to stay comfortably. everything is there in the beautiful kitchen to cook. \\r\\n\\r\\napartment is close to supermarket and muni street car and buses are both around the corner, and make for easy access to the rest of the city. there are recreations centers and park around if you bring kids.\\r\\njason\\'s apartment was great. it is clean, large and has everything you will need. myself and two colleagues were in town for meetings all week and it was a nice little neighbourhood to stay in. the cable car stop is just down the street and it took about 25 min to get to the heard of downtown. no issues, jason was great to communicate with. our stay at jason\\'s beautiful apartment couldn\\'t go better. the location is perfect and the views from the back and front are amazing. we loved to have our breakfast at the back terrace as well as lunch. and even though there is very nice livingroom area with couch and comfy chair we sat at the front windows at evenings just admireing the darkening hills view. \\nthe apartment itself has everything you would need. and it is actually bigger than we thought it would be.  pictures didn\\'t give that a way. \\nour two weeks stay felt shorter than it was and we would come back anytime! our visit to san francisco was great. the flat is even better than the photos, really sunny. there are some restaurants near it and a safeway supermarket one square away. the kitchen is awesome and all beds are great for resting after a long day. also, the transport is really good. glen park bart stop is close, muni buses or uber with the good working wifi. recommended! we had a really great time at viviane and lisa\\'s beautiful house. the house has lots of character and personal touches as well as a lovely garden. we stayed for three nights and found it to be very comfortable. the room and bathroom have everything you need for your stay including the fluffiest towels ever! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is a great place to stay - it\\'s very safe and there are restaurants nearby if you don\\'t want to venture too far away. it\\'s very close to golden gate park and you can also catch the bus to downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nviviane and lisa were very welcoming and made sure that we were happy throughout our stay and answered any questions we had about san francisco. milo their dog is awesome and is happy to perform some tricks in exchange for hugs. we\\'d definitely recommend this place for a stay in san francisco.the house is big with lots of space. it\\'s beautiful and well taken care of. you will feel at home undoubtedly. the garden is great and the kitchen area has a glass ceiling (which is awesome). the natural lighting inside the house is refreshing. you can have bbqs outside if you wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room i stayed in was beautiful. it has everything you may need. if you require anything else, viv and lele will jump to solve your problem. they really make sure that you are enjoying your stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is fantastic. just 60 seconds away from the golden gate park. 2 minutes away from the de young museum and the california academy of the sciences. make sure you check out nightlife on thursdays in the academy. go to the planetarium!

 easy access to 101 and the airport and for getting around.  we had a car so we didn\\'t use public transport.  the mission area is very close by for nightlife.  serena has a folder with all the necessary information in it.  we highly recommend staying here and it is superb for family or a group of friends.  we didn\\'t have any kids with us but if you do then there are plenty of toys and fun things.  lovely garden, although we didn\\'t have a chance to use it as our time went so fast!  book it.serena was a great host very friendly and with informative emails ensuring that every question (even the more unusual questions were answered).\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we arrived there was homemade banana bread,wine and tea left out for us which was very thoughtful (and tasty) as we arrived quite late. the view from the patio was amazing and it was easy to get into central san francisco.nice place, great host!

 excellent house and location. camila is a great host.my fiancee and i had a great time at the house. it was very conveniently located not too far away from downtown and all the tourist attractions but just far enough away at the same time to feel like a really unique and personal experience in san francisco. the bus stops right in front of the house which makes transportation easy. the house is gorgeous and worth every cent. camila always keeps a lot of flowers in the house and its always very clean! it was so colorful and it felt nice and private too. camila is a great host and every recommendation she gave me was perfect and i really enjoyed listening to her recommendations and seeing what she described come to life!

we were lucky to get invited to a private airbnb dinner at the house the day i arrived. this event was great and the good delicious. the atmosphere is very charming and every detail in the house is interesting. cami and carol talk about the history of the house in a very proud and entertaining way and you can see that they take pride in taking good care of the house and making their guests feel at home. highly recommended!

the pictures doesn\\'t make justice to the beauty of the house and the room. it\\'s an amazing place to stay: great room (very cozy, great bed, nice bathroom), beautiful victorian house, great location (next to a bus stop that takes you to any bart station or market street on a nonstop route, and really close to divisadero st, which has a lot of nice places to eat or have a drink), and the best hosts you will ever find: cami and carol! since the first day, they make you feel at home. and if you\\'d like, they will show you the best places to grab a bite (the ones where the local\\'s go to). they are very very nice and kind. i will love to stay here again on my next visit to sf.we had such a fantastic stay at cami and carol\\'s lovely home! the room is not just as pictured... it\\'s even better! the whole house is gorgeously and lovingly maintained. in addition to bedroom with ensuite, you have use of all of the living areas + kitchen. we liked the option of having breakfast or a quick lunch at home before going out to explore. the location was great, too! we walked most everywhere we wanted to go (albeit up some very big sf-style hills). there\\'s lots of great restaurants and bars nearby. i honestly can\\'t say enough nice things about this listing, and i really hope we can return one day soon to enjoy it all again. it was a real treat!

carol and cami and the cats were charming and the room was excellent, too. if you are on the fence about staying at an expensive downtown hotel and staying here, get off that fence and stay here! i will certainly be back!i absolutely loved my stay here.  cami & carol were amazing! they made me feel comfortable straight away. when i saw my room, it was even better than what i could have imagined just from the pictures. that bed alone..... it was hard to get up some mornings and make myself leave the room. the entire house is really enchanting, and i definitely spent a bit exploring and taking it all in.  the best part, is that while they are so inclusive and unbelievable hosts, i still felt like they were really excited for me to explore the city and didn\\'t feel \"hovering\" at all.  you still feel like it\\'s private, but with like, super amazing roommates that you sometimes see, haha. regardless, it truly was an amazing experience. the house is impeccable, the room was amazing, and i hope to see cami & carol again! they made my very first trip \"out west\" even that much better. i stayed in the garden room for six nights. it is a perfect room, clean and comfortable with everything you need. there are washing, drying and ironing facilities (perfect for the business traveller) as well as a great kitchen and a designated spot in the huge fridge.\\n\\nthe house itself is beautiful too - from the architecture to the furnishings. i felt like i was staying in an authentic old piece of sf. the location is very handy - a bus stop right outside,  a short taxi ride from most places i wanted to see and walking distance from others.\\n\\ncami and carol were great hosts - very welcoming, told me where were good places to go, local shops etc. i particularly appreciated their letting me leave my suitcase there while doing some sightseeing on my last day.\\n\\ni can recommend spencer house 100% - would love to come back next time i am in sf and will certainly tell friends and family to stay there if they are visiting!excellent!! great place to stay in a great location! very clean beautiful mansion. cami and carol were ver welcoming! would recommend them to everyone.  matt 4th time staying here... my default option whenever i visit sf. awesome stay, awesome hosts, awesome friends.we really enjoyed our stay in the garden room at the spencer house. cami was such a great host. she was extremely welcoming and friendly and immediately took us around the house and made us feel very at home. she is also really knowledgeable about the area and helpful in providing great restaurants recommendations. the room (and the entire house) was so beautiful and unique (not to mention everything was kept very clean). we would not hesitate to stay here again. thanks for the great experience!amazing place to stay, the house and the room are great. same for the localization on the wonderful host. thank you !

his home felt very welcoming and he had some great treats available for us as we walked in the door. cutting edge technology makes relaxing fun, and the location is great!\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you for a great stay.my experience at howard\\'s sf home was wonderful! his home is beautiful - it was spacious and very clean and comfortable. howard generously provided snacks, beverages, towels, and toiletries and made us feel at home. the living room/tv area was so cozy and the tv had so many viewing options including cable, netflix, hulu, and tivo. howard was so easy to contact and quickly responded to any questions i had. the home was cleaned prior to our arrival date and looked incredibly tidy. i hope to stay at howard\\'s flat again in the future and i definitely recommend him as a host!during my time in san francisco i stayed at two of vic\\'s houses. vic was a gracious and overall fantastic host. everybody at both the sunset an north beach houses were warm and welcoming. i felt right at home from the first moment. vic is incredible at taking care of any issues or problems you may have. seriously, though he may not always be around in person, you are guaranteed he will help to the best if his ability with anything you ask. he was also grey for organising events between the houses as well. i would definitely recommend/ stay at any of vic\\'s homes in the future.i never got to meet vic but the hosts, freddie and chiara, were super awesome and took great care of all of us staying there and the house and spread a good vibe. great location with an amazing view of sf. bonus treat - free bikes to borrow in the garage!vic was super welcoming, and everything was ready to go as soon as i arrived. very responsive host with an incredible home. will definitely be using his places again if i\\'m traveling through. this is a great place to stay if you are visiting sf and are interested in meeting nice, fun people. the house was huge and very well taken care of.   i had a great time and would definitely stay again.vic is amazing!

my experience at the haight house was a truly remarkable stay. the house is super convenient to many destinations in sf. the other housemates were very friendly and made the stay feel like home. the house has an amazing view of the downtown skyline and is very close to several public transportation stops. those are two of the many perks available at this location and you won\\'t be disappointed in choosing this house as your place to stay. vic is a fantastic host. the house, people and neighbourhood were all great as well. highly recommend!

allie and carly were incredibly accommodating and didn\\'t miss a single detail. from the ghiradelli chocolates on the towels when we arrived to the extremely comfortable beds and beautiful home, i would prefer staying here over any luxury hotel in the bay area. i can\\'t wait to stay here again!!we had a wonderful stay in allie\\'s charming home.  she and her sister went the extra mile with fresh flowers, champagne & party favors.  we were celebrating thanks to these lovely sisters for opening up their beautiful home to me. it was better then i expected and i expected a lot. super clean and most of all cozy and chic. check in and out was very easy and they accommodated me whenever i asked. great experience and a super warm welcoming. thanks ladies for making my thanksgiving in san fran amazing!!!!!we had such a wonderful time at carly & allie\\'s beautiful home. it was absolutely stunning. they had decorated the place for the holidays and no detail was forgotten. we truly felt like we were at home. the place was immaculately clean - the beds were super comfortable and there were great bath amenities provided. the location was excellent - just a quick walk to the cute marina shops and restaurants. we hope to return soon & make this our home away from home when visiting sf!

(we fought him tooth & nail and we suggest you do the same!). their bernal heights house is absolutely marvelous. completely studded inch by inch with toby & joe\\'s work. their backyard is absolutely breath taking and their cottage was the home away from home we had hoped for.  it is perfectly clean & cozy.  perfect for two people, or even a lone traveler.  we stayed on relatively cold nights and the insulation of the cottage was so efficient, we never had to use a heater.  we cannot stress enough how absolutely wonderful these hosts are.  they even sent us away with a packet full of prints & post cards to remember them with.  only sad part about the trip was not being able to stay longer!

toby and joe are so inspiring, caring and helpfull persons, and i feel extremely lucky to have met them. when i left they asked their neibour to drive me to the airport when i couldnt get hold on a taxi; to take one example of their helpfullness.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe cottage and the garden is a very mindfull place, the nature and tobys art makes it a perfect place to relax, create and get new energy. \\r\\n\\r\\nbernal heights is a very quit and safe neighborhood with some nice cafes and resturant in cortland avenue. its walkingdistance to the mission area (if you like to walk) and close to alot of busses that will take you to other places of the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nif you get the opportunity to stay with toby and joe you are a lucky person. i will never forget my stay and hope that i can come back in the future. i had a terrific stay at toby & joe\\'s garden cottage in bernal heights, san francisco. from the minute i arrived they made me feel welcome and at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe garden and the little cottage are wonderfully decorated and the quiet there was a nice change to the noise and hectic of downtown, where i had stayed the days before. the house is in a lovely neighborhood and many great restaurants, cafés and shops are in walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe best thing about the stay though, were the two hosts. toby and joe are two remarkable artists and amazing hosts. it is a privilege to hear their stories from around the world, about art and new technologies and to see how affectionate they are with each other. they take interest in their guests and what they are up to, yet always leave you enough space to do your thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe two nights i stayed at their cottage were definitely too short and i am looking forward to coming back. to see more of the city, share more stories with toby and joe and enjoy more cups of coffee in their lovely garden reading.\\r\\n\\r\\ni can absolutely recommend staying with them! (but don\\'t book it all the time so i get a chance to come back.)what a wonderful experience we had staying with toby and joe. it definitely made our san fran holiday. they are a delightful and friendly couple and incredibly talented artists. we enjoyed having breakfast with them in the morning and learning about their lives and sharing ours with them. the cottage is charming in a lovely backyard surrounded by toby\\'s art. although we didn\\'t use it they offered us the washer and dryer which could be very helpful for those on longer trips. the neighborhood was cute and parking super easy. garden cottage is a must see when in sf and toby and joe are fabulous hosts. arriving in cozy cottage we were already amazed. it was even better than on the pictures. we loved the atmosphere. we loved to chat with toby and joe in the morning and would have loved to stay longer. they are wonderful people, great caring hosts. our baby aaron fell in love with them and so did we. the whole place is somehow magic. definitely a great place to stay! we keep this place in best memories and hope to be back on day.eureka!! you know the feeling when one has struck gold....well, we found toby and joe.:) our stay in san francisco was the coziest, heart warming, unique, genuine and inspirational time... given all the places, walks, sights, restaurants, bars, galleries and sunny weather we experienced, our highlight was sharing time with toby and joe shooting the breeze over a hot cup of coffee and fresh bread... they feel like dream grandparents who live life and share their wisdom with a good dosage of humor... we felt like we had our own space, yet we were inspired by their presence and just chillaxed...highly, highly recommended for peeps who don\\'t want a 5 star hotel and prefer a real experience with a lovely couple. need i say more...:)\\r\\ntoby and joe are outstanding hosts, and their garden cottage is absolutely charming.  warm and welcoming, quaint and serene.  the room is amazingly convenient to sfo, steps from great food and coffee on cortland st., and lovely bernal heights with its panoramic views of the city.  you could not wish for a cozier refuge in the middle of a wonderful city, nor could you hope for more thoughtful, personable and fascinating hosts than toby and joe.  i look forwarding to returning often.we came without any expectations not of the city and not of our staying. and we feel so lucky that we had the change to stay in this lovely cottage in the garden of these lovely couple. i won\\'t even try to subscribe it. the best tip i can give you is just book it!! and you will find a lovely story, one of a kind you\\'ll won\\'t come a cross soon again. we have the best memory to take home again. what a nice experience! would we do it again? yes we would! the best part of it all was toby and joe - our attentive, helpful and warmhearted hosts. even though we stayed only 6 nights we got to know each other and got a bunch of useful tips on shops in the area and about sf in general. great for a first time visiter. we really enjoyed bernal heights (has all you might need) and rented electric bikes, had great breakfasts and dinners in walking distance from the cottage. public transport to downtown sf is easy to figure out. the house and cottage has a wonderful creative soul and with two great hosts this is definitely the place to be for those looking for an accomodation - one of its kind - that differs immensely from an ordinary and plain hotel experience.toby and joe are among the sweetest people i\\'ve ever met in sf.  they reminded me of my grandparents even though they are younger than my parents.  joe...helping me with my luggage and stuffing oranges into my bag as i was rushing off to work.  toby... showing me around her art studio.  they are truly lovely people.  bed was very comfortable and cottage was cozy.  the only person for whom i would recommend with caution would be an elderly person who might struggle making the walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  otherwise, so long as you\\'re good with bathing versus a shower, it\\'s a lovely, one-of-a-kind experience with a delightful and inspirational couple. staying with toby and joe was a perfect start for our california trip. they have a beautiful house and a wonderful cottage, almost as if you were entering into a different world that is truly peaceful.\\r\\ntheir hospitality is only paralleled by their love for art ;-) \\r\\nwe loved the way they were caring about us, e.g. providing us with inside information about bernal heights where to shop or have a coffee.\\r\\nall the best to toby and joe from their german friends,\\r\\nolga and samywhat a fabulous couple! we felt incredibly lucky to have met toby and joe. staying with them in the cottage made our time in san francisco very special. when we first saw the listing on airbnb we knew we\\'d have a great time, but staying there was actually beyond our expectations. this wasn\\'t just a place to sleep, we loved exchanging stories, hearing about life in san francisco, eating oranges and talking about art. the cottage was great, we had 3 very cosy nights sleep. we\\'d love to come again, please!\\r\\ntoby and joe were great hosts and were always ready to help us out with questions. they showed us around their studios (also part of the house) where we saw plenty of examples of their art over the years. the garden cottage itself is comfortable and private. we found public transport to downtown san francisco to be a bit inconvenient but there is a freeway nearby which will take you in by car. there are several cafes, coffee shops and restaurants to visit on nearby cortland avenue - we recommend vinorosso.toby and joe were incredibly gracious hosts. we really enjoyed staying in their cottage and getting to see their artwork! they gave us a lot of valuable information about places to go and things to do in sf and provided us with some great maps and guides. they are very genuine, caring people who made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. parking was very easy in their neighborhood, and there were also a lot of great restaurants and cafés nearby. it was easy to get around. my boyfriend and i had a great time! thank you toby and joe! it\\'s all true.\\r\\n\\r\\nso i won\\'t repeat what\\'s been said thirty times already. but i\\'ll add the following: \\r\\n\\r\\nthe sunday flea market is filled with interesting items.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring the school year you can hear the kids playing at the playground across the street as you brush your teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room is super quiet at night and the futon is surprisingly comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is super convenient and is right off the highway (101).\\r\\n\\r\\nthey removed the down bedding so i had no trouble with allergies to the bedding (and there are no pets running around either).\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat place to stay!toby and joe are fantastic hosts. the cottage is very cute and quiet. the garden is a beautiful place to sit and have a cup off coffee or a glass of wine. great experience we will visit again. \\n\\nscott & nancitoby and joe were wonderful hosts and i feel very lucky to have stayed with them. they gave me valuable practical advice about the city, and great tips. the cottage is charming and comfortable, and the garden is perfect for hanging out, reading, or working. it\\'s very quiet and i loved the neighborhood which has lots of great restaurants and cafés and shops. i even managed to go running in the park! the muni stop is very close, so even if you\\'re not driving it\\'s very easy to get anywhere in the city. all in all, a perfect holiday in san francisco! toby and joe are the quintessential hip san franciscans! their home is a reflection of their art and their lives. we got far more than a trip to san francisco and time away as a couple; we got inspired. even though toby and joe are in a generation older than us, they have that youthful spirit that is timeless. they are the type of couple that pick up and move to crete to live for eight years. their art is found in every nook and cranny of their home, and they have found a way in the confines of a small footprint to have a studio for each of them and still airbnb with their garden shed (plenty of space and insulation).\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we reach their ages, we hope we are still as youthful of them and full of life. they had so much beyond their home to share with us. this was truly a rich experience. don\\'t miss the chance to stay a few nights with these gems of human beings.the most awesome little eclectic place i have ever stayed! toby and joe are amazing, caring and beautiful people. their compassion shows throughout their amazing home. my partner and i stayed here while in s.f. to tie the knot and had a fantastic experience!

we couldn\\'t have imagined a more memorable encounter with sf and its people. toby and joe are fantastic hosts, gifted with a sense of beauty and stunning creativity that leaves an imprint on every corner of their house. we left this cute garden house full of inspiration, ideas about how to keep our lives exiting, and with some gorgeous samples of their art. this is way more than just a place to sleep. the house has a view on the bay and offers a garden in which you can spend long and peaceful mornings before immersing yourself into the more hectic parts of sf (muni-stops are nearby). thanks for everything!\\r\\n\\r\\n(url hidden)dominik and ligaas my sister said, the quintessential san francisco experience!  joe and toby are gracious hosts, and the cottage perfect for our family reunion in bernal heights.  comfortable and convenient.  we only wish we could have spent more time at the cottage and in the garden amongst the art, flowers and with the hummingbird!our stay with with toby and joe in their beautiful garden cottage was our first airbnb experience. from our first meeting and touring their beautiful eclectic and artsy home... we felt so welcome and comfortable. conversations about travels around their kitchen table was a highlight of our trip. we enjoyed getting to know toby and joe and staying at their home just as much if not more than san francisco. may our paths meet again! we totally fell in love with toby and joe!!  staying in their cottage was more like being houseguests at the home of dear friends than staying in an ordinary b & b.  we had long wonderful talks with them, lots of laughter, and sharing of art stories and information.  toby and joe\\'s = our home whenever we are in sf from now on!wow!

toby + joe were welcoming, generous, helpful, and kind. (if i lived in san francisco i would want to get together with them for conversation over a cup of greek/turkish coffee or a glass of wine!)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe cottage and environs were a perfect blend of comfort, nature, whimsy, and art.\\r\\n\\r\\nit was a perfect stay for me!\\r\\nwe couldn\\'t have found better hosts than toby and joe!  the cottage is warm, welcoming, filled with beautiful artwork, and surrounded by wonderful succulents cared for by joe and his green thumbs. tea, coffee, oranges and conversation with toby and joe were such a treat! bernal heights was such a fun neighborhood to walk through and toby shared many helpful suggestions about our visit to the city.  we enthusiastically recommend the cottage and the lovely toby and joe!!it was all very enjoyable, great room and very hospitable host. much recommendedthe cottage is a gem. it is cozy, quiet and peaceful. toby and joe are kind and warm hosts, and i had the distinct privilege of sitting up late into the night with them, drinking tea and talking about distance places and times. erudite and well-traveled, toby and joe have woven artistic magic in bernal heights.joe and toby\\'s garden cottage was such a delightful treat! the garden is beautiful and the cottage is cozy, and the quirks of the house are wonderfully fun. joe and toby were sweet, welcoming, and charming, and it felt like we were staying with familiar friends if not family. if you are interested in a unique place with character and more than a little bit of artful magic, don\\'t miss this place!what gracious, interesting and kind-hearted hosts! toby and joe were welcoming from the moment we arrived and while i only had time for a quick coffee, spending some time with them the morning we left was one of the highlights of my stay in the city. tony and i thought the cottage and hosts were magical. highly recommended. toby and joe are wonderful people and hosts! their home is so welcoming and the studio out back is incredibly cozy. i\\'ll be back!!it is true, toby and joe are not only fantastic hosts, they are also a very sweet couple! we felt right at home during our 4 night stay at their charming cottage. besides our lovely talks over tea and coffee with them, they were very generous and sweet when giving advice about things to do around the city or with anything we needed to know. both of them are gifted and successful artists and the artwork that adorns their house will make you feel like you\\'re in a gallery. it is a real treat. we would very highly recommend their hospitality and company to anyone who wants to visit san francisco. toby and joe\\'s house is incredible! their artwork is everywhere and i loved the aesthetic. absolutely gorgeous garden terrace with some of the largest succulents i\\'ve ever seen. the cottage itself was very cute and cozy. we had an easy time sleeping on the comfortable futon (didn\\'t even know it wasn\\'t a bed). quiet and walkable neighborhood with quick access to lots of restaurant and grocery options. joe and toby were very sweet and accommodating hosts - my partner was sick and they provided us with tea, oranges, and vitamin c. plus joe snuck a bunch of snacks into our bag of leftovers for our long drive home. i would definitely recommend staying with joe and toby and hope to make it out there again soon. great company with these talented, helpful hosts.we had a really lovely time staying with toby & joe. the cottage was the perfect spot for us to spend a few nights and bernal heights was great.  moreover we most enjoyed our chats with toby and joe which ranged from artwork to travels to embroidery designs. thanks for everything!\\n\\nlara & robvery comfortable and accommodating stay at the garden cottage charming! toby and joe are amazing, i only regret my stay was so brief but if i\\'m ever in the bay area again, i\\'d definitely come back to garden cottage charming. toby and joe are great people. we were so exhausted after the long flight, their garden cottage and nice welcome were just perfect. we loved the bed. and also to sit and talk with them. they probably have the coolest place in san francisco! we would be happy to see you again. toby and joe were absolutely wonderful hosts. they are extremely interesting people and truly enjoy meeting others. hosting guests suites them quite well. but they really shine in knowing the balance between engaging with the guest and giving them their space. we had some enjoyable, long breakfasts together, but i also grabbed my coffee and was out the door in other days. to future guests, i\\'d recommend bringing sandals and a small bath poof (loofah?). overall, staying at their cottage elevated my overall trip and would definitely come back. truly a pleasure to be their guests.oh toby & joe, i miss you! \\r\\n\\r\\n:-) \\r\\n\\r\\ni will always take with me  the memory of every morning breakfast in their company in their so sweet kitchen! lovely pottery! yummi jam! cosy cottage...what else? i think it is enough for a 5 stars!toby, joe and their lovely cottage made the perfect week in san francisco possible! the two offered us a lot of information about the neighbourhood (peruvian food njamnjam and great coffee wakeupwakeup) and were helpful with everything. it was also great to sit and talk in their sunny kitchen and hear stories about an artist\\'s life all over the world=) the cottage provides everything you need and the garden is a wonderful thing to wake up to. thanks again!toby and joe were lovely! very warm and hospitable, and quick to offer help or suggestions. they left a whole list of recommendations in the neighborhood and very sweet welcome package.  the cottage was so cozy and comfortable that it was difficult to have to get up and leave in the morning! anyone would be lucky to stay here and have such a special space and hosts to match. toby and joe really epitomize what it means to be a host and to build a community through creating a personal connection and organically fostering an amazing experience. i would stay with them again in a heartbeat!the backyard cottage at toby and joe\\'s is lovely - a comfortable artistic cottage sanctuary amongst the sunshine and succulents in the garden. the private bathroom with a deep tub to soak in is such a nice travel luxury.\\n\\ntoby and joe are amazing. they were so warm and generous, assisting us with local knowledge and tips, and making us (and especially our daughter) feel very welcome. their home is like an art gallery, and they are such interesting, good humoured and lovely people - we wanted to move into the cottage for good. \\n\\nbernal heights is a great area. the local flea market was a treasure trove of vintage pickings, and the shopping strip (a couple of minutes walk away) has cafes, bakeries, pubs and grocery options. the bus into the mission is very convenient, and the nearby hill offers spectacular views over the bay.\\n\\nwe thoroughly recommend toby and joe\\'s backyard cottage - a delight. we had the most wonderful time in the small cottage! the cottage is cozy and private and surrounded by beautiful artwork but the best about this place are the amazing hosts toby & joe. the two are very generous, nice and interesting people and i wish we would have had more time to talk to them. we would love to return one day! \\nthank you so much for your hospitality! all the best! we absolutely loved staying with toby and joe! the cottage is adorable and their garden is very charming. they are accommodating hosts and we really enjoyed getting tours of their studios and getting to know a little bit about them. the location is great, they\\'re just a short walk from the lively cortland ave where there are many places to eat or grab a drink. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was exactly what we were looking for and i\\'d recommend it to anyone who wants a unique experience while staying in sf. we had a very good time at toby and joe\\'s room. we appreciated their presence, conversations and cookies ( :p ). the cottage is lovely and the garden, with all that drawings, amazing!what a wonderful introduction to san francisco! toby and joe are not only great hosts, they\\'re simply delightful engaging people with so much willingness to share their knowledge of the city and the art world of sf.  we ended up spending quite a bit of time simply exchanging stories and chatting about everything from world travels to great art aps for my iphone.  our accommodations in the garden cottage were lovely and cozy, a sancuary after full days of exploring the city.  this picture doesn\\'t do it justice as the cottage is immersed in a patio of well tended plants, flowers and art.  our artistic hunger needs were met and satisfied by the aesthetically lush world that they have created there in bernal heights. \\r\\njoe was always quick to offer us tea, coffee, water or another biscotti along with fresh bread and exquisite  jams.  he even packed us a snack bag to take along with us for our bike ride across the golden gate bridge. toby gave us the grand tour of both studios and enlightened us on marketing strategies in the art world. we are hoping that toby and joe  will visit us on our own turf here in oregon sometime..  \\r\\nthank you for a wonderful time and for sharing your lives with us. toby and joe was a sweetheart. they cared about us a lot while we\\'re staying in their cottage. every single detail of the house is beautiful since it\\'s full of their amazing artworks. thanks to toby and joe, we had a really great time in sf. i miss them already!our stay with toby and joe was our first experience of airbnb and it could not have been better. they welcomed us into their home and community with open arms and hearts. at every stage they made our stay in their home a delight and a pleasure. they provided us with a long list of local cafes, shops, restaurants and bakeries, each with a different story and most of which we tried and loved! on top of that, the tour of heir studios and our discussions about art and life made the trip special. we greatly look forward to returning to san francisco and staying with toby and joe again.the cottage was very comfortable and cozy for our two night stay! toby and joe were incredibly accomodating and sweet. i only wish we had more time to hear more of their incredible stories, and relax in their incredible garden!toby and joe were great hosts and their cottage was a really nice space to stay. they were friendly and made sure we had everything we needed for the days we were there. there\\'s only a bathtub to bathe in (no shower head) which was a little difficult but still comfortable and clean. we had a car so we were super close to everything since the highway entrance is right next to their place. the area it\\'s in is also really nice, lots of interesting artsy shops and coffee shops just a short walk away. we had a great time in san francisco. toby and joe were wonderful hosts and made sure we had everything we needed. the cottage was quiet and nice and we slept well. the location is great. \\nthank you toby and joe for making our trip to sf so wonderful. from our welcome package of their art postcards and cutouts to our parting studio tour, toby and joe\\'s generosity and creativity was inspirational. we had a wonderful stay with toby and joe in their charming garden cottage. they made friends with us quickly and shared wonderful stories about their art and life philosophy.  toby gave us many tips about great spots to see (even arranging a private tour  of airbnb hq for us) and joe made us many cups of tea and never let us leave the house without a biscotti \\'for the road\\'.  the bed was comfortable, the fluffy duvet was warm and cozy; the neighborhood was safe, quiet and convenient.  this wonderful experience is what airbnb is all about!  toby and joe were amazing hosts. they were very prompt in responding, and honest and upfront about their expectations. my boyfriend and i were travelling to sf by car, and t&j were very accommodating as to the arrival time. when we arrived, they were warm and welcoming, and made sure we had everything we needed to be cozy. they are quite well stocked, and have thought of any amenity you could need. they even gave us some postcards and gifts of their artwork, which have been a hit with my lab mates and pals!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe garden cottage was adorable! the whole outdoor area which they leave aside for airbnb guests was simply phenomenal. one of my favorite parts of my vacation was having tea and delicious bread in the garden for breakfast! \\r\\n\\r\\ntoby and joe are filled to the brim with joy, and it shows in their demeanor and the attitude of the house. we thoroughly enjoyed chatting with them in the mornings and evenings, and learning about the local quirks of sf. they directed us to many a fun and hidden gem of the city. in the home, they gave us privacy, but were always available if we needed or forgot something. the parking was straightfoward and the location is near enough to downtown that you can easily access it, but far away enough to avoid excessive noise and traffic. all in all, i could not have asked for a better first airbnb experience!! thank you, toby and joe, for everything!!\\r\\n\\r\\na couple things i thought people should consider:\\r\\n1) they have a bathtub for guests--no shower. i did not mind at all, but i think perhaps some people would\\r\\n2) there is no bathroom in the cottage itself--you have to walk across the garden and into the garage. again, i did not mind in the least (in fact, i kinda liked it!), but some folks might not. \\r\\n3) the curtains to the cottage let light in early. i am an early riser, so it didn\\'t bother me in the least, but if you like to sleep in, perhaps consider asking for a heavier curtain to leave the light out. \\r\\n\\r\\nto summarise, my experience with toby and joe was fantastic--they were attentive and friendly hosts, and the garden cottage was straight out of a novel! i would highly recommend for anybody traveling through sf!!\\r\\n\\r\\ntoby and joe are fantastic! the garden cottage is very sweet, eclectic, and relaxing. our hosts were welcoming, kind and extremely helpful  about the area. we really enjoyed getting to know them. they were willing to share their stories and helpful tips about being an artist. the location was easy to find, very clean and very close to the airport.the place wa the best for me, in a district where only people from here lives.\\r\\nthe cottage, toby and joe was perfect. nice moments a the morning when we talked each other, nice breackfast , they have wonderful tips for the city.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ll come back !!!\\r\\n\\r\\ntoby and joe are the greatest hosts! i would def stay at this little ute cottage again. the cottage is very clean and the futon is extremely comfortable. keep in mind that the tub does not have a shower head. i highly recommend staying here.   me and my girlfriend fernanda have a great time at the cottage. toby and joe make the difference, they have interesting stories and a incredible artistic life. it\\'s like being at home with friends! we had a wonderful stay at toby and joe\\'s. the cottage was very comfortable and the garden with all the art work was a lovely place to relax. toby and joe were very accommodating and allowed us to help ourselves to breakfast/tea/coffee, as well as use of the washing machine, very welcome after a weeks camping! we\\'d definitely stay here again, and recommend it to friends. thanks!we have stayed 4 days with toby and joe.\\r\\nthe couple was welcoming and charming with us. they were looking at our flight arrival to see when we were coming.\\r\\ntoby has checked us in by giving us the keys of the cottage and all the house rules.\\r\\nwe have then chatted a little to see where we can go for a light dinner and made our way to cortland rd a charming commercial street.\\r\\nhaving breakfast every morning in the garden was a real pleasure, and an amazing starts to holidays. we could not have asked for more.\\r\\nnow if you are super keen on staying in a modern property this is not for you, but old has it\\'s charms that new can not get.\\r\\ncortland is the perfect start around sf, easy access to union square to golden gate park etc.\\r\\nwe loved it.we had a great experience at toby and joe\\'s cottage.  we enjoyed the privacy of the cottage and bathroom as well as our interactions with our hosts in the communal kitchen.  the garden setting is lovely, the bed is very comfortable, and the neighborhood quiet with easy parking on the street.  as we were on east coast time it was nice to have access to the kitchen at 5am for morning coffee.  best part of the stay was getting to know our hosts, both artists with impressive studios on the ground floor, and interesting stories to tell.  this was such a better experience than a hotel!it was so nice to stay at this lovely cottage. toby and joe are great hosts who are very inspiring. everything is how described, they give imformation material and share also their kitchen. the atmosphere is warmly and welcome. toby and joe were wonderful hosts.  they make you feel at home and are very warm and sweet.  the cottage is comfy and it has everything you need.  i am so happy i chose to stay with them.  downtown san francisco is a short 5-10 minute drive away so it was convenient and easy to go explore for the day and come back to the cottage to rest.  also, take the time to really look at and appreciate all of their wonderful art!we had a great time with toby and joe. they are very sweet and always made sure we had the comforts we needed, including an all access pass to endless biscotti. the cottage was a great place to land after busy days of sightseeing. we enjoyed checking in with our joyful hosts in the evenings and are happy we made time to connect over tea. \\n\\nin general, for those who don\\'t mind city driving, i would consider renting a car. we traveled via the bus and using uber. a car of our own would have given us more freedom during the short amount of time we had and probably would have been less expensive.when we arrived, toby greeted us with a warm welcome.  the bernal heights neighborhood was charming; provided a wonderful view of the city, great restaurants and a local farmers market.  the cottage was cozy and it was so pleasant to stay among the hummingbirds and artwork in the garden.  it was an absolutely wonderful stay.i\\'ll just start by saying this: stay with toby and joe if you have the chance. they\\'re lovely, generous and interesting people who treated us in the best possible way, and their place is beautiful and unique.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou can tell that these guys have been hosting airbnb guests for a while. the cottage in the garden is very well set up, and we got perfect information about the shared areas. the kitchen has what you need for a simple breakfast, and stuff like water bottles provided, and gluten-free bread (which toby asked about when i had booked) is more than you expect already.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut that\\'s just the practical stuff, and not what makes toby and joe such fantastic hosts. the place itself is unique, with the hosts own art (which is everywhere, from the garden to the bathroom) giving it much of it\\'s special character.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut what we\\'ll remember for a long time is just hanging out with toby and joe themselves. they really made us feel like we were staying with friends or family, and we had a lot of fun just listening to their stories and talking about this and that. they\\'re quite extraordinary people who have led interesting lives, but they were also very generous and kind to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nbernal heights is a slightly off location in s.f., even though we walked several times to the mission district (takes between half an hour and an hour, maybe, depending on where you\\'re going). the lesson we took from our stay was to rely on uber, and not taking the bus – it\\'s not really worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor us, living close to mission but in a quiet neighborhood was perfect. bernal heights itself is actually very charming and a pretty great place to hang out, with a lot of cafés and restaurants on cortland avenue. we ended more than one night with something to drink on cortland.\\r\\n\\r\\none thing to note if you want to stay with toby and joe is that the shower situation isn\\'t exactly on the cutting edge of technology (it involves a bucket). since the place is the way it is, that just became part of the charm for us, but if you\\'re extremely particular about your showers you might have an issue.\\r\\n\\r\\ntl;dr - we loved staying with toby and joe and you should too.we had a wonderful stay at toby and joe\\'s. they are such welcoming hosts. most helpful in any way. they made us maps and lists. they introduced us to uber. and when the wifi signal wasn\\'t strong enough for my necessary video conference one night, they gladly let me make use of their kitchen. thank you again toby & joe!we had a 2-night stay at the cottage and we loved it! all thanks to both toby & joes\\' warm hospitality. we enjoyed having our breakfast at the garden right outside the cottage. we would certainly return for a second stay the next time we visit san francisco.toby and joe welcomed caitlin and i to their home like friends they\\'d known for years. we spent both of our nights there chatting, listening to their stories about crete, living in san francisco, hosting on airbnb and growing up on the east coast. even though we were visiting from within san francisco, a \"staycation\", we didn\\'t know much about bernal heights; toby and joe told us about all their favorite spots and people. we left bernal feeling like we\\'d truly lived there for a couple nights.\\r\\n\\r\\ntoby and joe are the reason caitlin and i stay in airbnb listings. they have more than a bed to sleep in; they have stories, wisdom, kindness and unending hospitality. where do i begin! what a wonderful experience staying with toby and joe. from their interesting stories to their lovely hospitality, you will feel like you\\'re home :) their home is an amazing, eclectic piece of art and the cottage is a very cute and cozy extension of that. nothing really beats coming home at the end of the day to stories, ginger tea and biscotti. i highly recommend stay here. it\\'s made our trip to san francisco nothing short of magical! i hope to return soon. the little cottage was a comfy and cozy place to stay. toby and joe have thought of every detail to make my stay pleasant. i hope to stay there again when i visit sf in the future.toby和joe是我在美国遇到的最好的朋友,他们不仅仅是房东,更是家人,他们教会我很多很多东西,房间里的床柔软又舒适,我和宝宝很喜欢住在这个美丽的花园里。toby和joe给了我们很多帮助,让我和宝宝的第一次美国之行非常愉快,真想再次见到他们。toby and joe is the best friend i met in the united states, they are not just the horst,but also family.they teach me so much.\\nthe bed is soft and comfortable in the room, my baby and i very like to live in the beautiful garden.\\ntoby and joe gave us a lot of help, let me and the baby had a very pleasant trip to the united states for the first time. i want to see them soon.\\ntoby and joe are true, lovely artists. it can be seen in everything they do - from the beautiful cabin, to their house, yard and stories they have to tell. they welcomed us as old friends, and had amazing recommendations for both our stay and future. i could not recommend the experience enough - you will leave with not only a great place to stay and sleep, but also with a kindred friendship and authentic appreciation for the city and life.the description was excetly what it looks like. people around us are rely nice and kind. host are so nice and welcome. i feel really confortable when i stay there. hot water, and snack are free to eat and host love to talk with you when they are available. i feel like home. it is such a good place to start my airbnb experience. my first air bnb was spent as a guest in toby and joes sweet little cottage. before arriving i imagined myself in this little artist hideaway. i simply loved it. toby and joe were wonderful to me. i was there over the xmas holiday and my son was nearby at the home of his girlfriends parents. my whole experience fit me perfectly. toby gave me some gracious art nudging and overall they were generous with their time and hearts. they enjoy this and it shows! toby and joe were the most welcoming hosts i have ever encountered. we had a lovely time and honestly couldn\\'t have asked for more gracious and obviously interesting people. my husband & i had a wonderful time staying at toby & joe\\'s cottage! we felt as though we were staying with friends more than with \"hosts\". \\r\\n\\r\\nwe received information about arrangements and logistics shortly after making our booking and got oodles more great info. once we arrived. it was really helpful to review our plans with our friendly insider experts and getting to know them both was truly a highlight of our trip!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe accommodations were as quaint as they looked. we loved them so much we took photos and showed our jealous friends  :\\r\\ntoby & joe are warm-hearted and amazing artists. it was a rare treat to be surrounded by art as soon as we arrived in sf, which we consider the cultural mecca of the west coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe\\'re looking forward to future visits  :magical. \\r\\nthe listing itself was wonderful, it was a little place out back that let you feel like you had your own place in san fran. i sat out in the garden and soaked in the sun and wonderful environment that toby and joe had created.\\r\\n\\r\\ni felt so welcome. communicating with both toby and joe was easy as pie. they were there to greet me when i arrived and whenever i came home from my days adventures, but they seemed very sensitive to never invade my space or time. my husband and i enjoyed sitting with them and talking about our mutual art interests and we enjoyed their stories about greece. \\r\\ni have never had such wonderful hosts and so instantly comfortable in someone else\\'s home. toby and joe were wonderful hosts.  their knowledge of san francisco helped me plan my stay and activities.  the cottage was clean, comfortable and an unique experience.  the location was close to all major freeways which made my commute to south bay tolerable.   highly recommend this stay.  take advantage of morning coffee with the hosts and be prepared to exchange stories and life experiences.  upon arrival we were greeted with both excitement and warmth by our hosts: toby and her charming husband joe.  they greeted us into their home as if we were old friends.  we were treated to a quick tour of the lovely cottage and grounds.  the cottage is very private and quaint, it is also decorated very richly with both artifacts from their personal travels and their own art (they are both famous artists.)  everything was clean and tidy and the small use of space was utilized effectively to fit most of your belongings.  the garden in back was beautiful and serene.  we spent some of our mornings drinking coffee and eating our biscotti’s (offered by our hosts).  the neighborhood was the 2nd best thing to the cottage and our hosts.  everything is within walking distance and the neighborhood offers a variety of coffee shops, good eats, parks, and even a natural market.  our first airbnb experience has turned out to be wonderful! the loving couple toby and joe are very caring and warm-hearted. we told that from the animal-related articles, map, as well as sightseeing guidebook they\\'ve prepared when we first entered the lovely cottage. thanks to joe for showing us the neighborhood, he shared us history of that area (some houses were even built in 1800\\'s!), showed us their favorite cafe and introduced us to his neighbors --- some of them even asked if we were just moved in :d. this actually the main reason why we wanted to try airbnb, we want to know how local people live, staying at hotel won\\'t allow us to have such experience. we\\'d also like to thank toby for giving us a studio tour! it\\'s so impressive to see so many fantastic art works of toby, and know that she makes her own colors! the little sunny garden in front of the cottage is very cute, we loved sitting among those beautiful plants having our breakfast. all in all, we had good time in tobby and joe\\'s cottage, we will definitely recommend it to our friends.you will never meet better hosts than toby and joe!  they enthusiastically greeted me upon arrival, offered me tea and biscotti, and showed me to the cottage.  the garden cottage charming is super cozy! the house, garden, and cottage are clad with joe and toby\\'s original artwork, which makes for a consistently interesting and beautiful view. it\\'s so much more than just a place to crash while you\\'re visiting the city; it\\'s an entire experience of its own.  as fine artists and mentors, toby and joe\\'s love for one another is truly inspiring, and there are many layers beneath. i hope to visit them again soon!staying with toby and joe absolutely made our trip to san francisco. not only are they welcoming and kind but their cottage is a fab wee hideaway in the big city. bernal heights had loads of great coffee shops and restaurants nearby and the 14 from town stopped nearby on mission.  definitely go and meet toby and joe, if you get the chance. you\\'ll not regret it. i hope we will get the chance to return. toby and joe are the ideal hosts, they are an incredibly personable, caring and loving couple. we felt like we were staying with family members as opposed to strangers. as for the house, it is an old house, so do not expect things to be bright and shiny like in a hotel, the accommodations in general are a bit rustic but the charm of the place takes over and you will find absolutely everything you need. the bedroom is small but comfy and the bathroom has a claw foot tub, so expect to take baths not showers.  the kitchen is shared with the hosts, which is great as you get to interact with toby and joe and soak up their wonderful energy, and see their artwork which is decadently superb. the courtyard is the cherry on the cake, an evening of wine and cheese is an absolute must! our overall experience was indeed a lovely one and we would gladly stay with them again. \\nthis was an enjoyable trip. i really loved toby and joe. absolutely fascinating and lovely people. the cottage was exactly like the picture. the only downside was there was no heat and it was a cold couple of days. but i put on a blanket and was fine. i wish i would have had more time to sit in the back and enjoy the yard.toby and joe were so welcoming, especially as i was a first-time visitor to san francisco. i enjoyed tea and biscotti with them over breakfast, and was grateful for fresh fruit always available to me in the fridge. their insight into the city, and the art world, was invaluable, and i hope we continue to stay in touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home is quite the collection of these two fabulous artists\\' work! toby was gracious and gave me a tour through their collections and personal studios. (be sure to ask them about the six years they lived in crete!) fyi: come prepared for a tub-only bathroom!\\r\\n\\r\\nbernal heights offers a fun walk down cortland ave. toby and joe offered a hand-drawn map to show the best walkable route to avoid killer hills. so helpful! be sure to take a look at their four-page neighborhood guide—places to eat, shops, even city highlights! (pinhole coffee, red hill station, and succulence were my favorite cortland shops.)toby and joe made us feel welcome from the moment we drove up.  they were there to make sure we had a good parking spot. \\r\\nthe cottage was completely cozy and adorable. the bed was comfy and cozy. they had snacks for us and a number of suggestions for where to go and what to see. the location was one of our favorite in san francisco. we could start our morning drinking coffee and chatting with our hosts, and then walk around the corner for a yoga class at bernal yoga before heading out to see the rest of the city.  if i lived in san francisco, i\\'d want to live in this neighborhood. it had everything. thanks toby and joe for being such wonderful hostesses!  toby and joe were wonderful hosts. i felt like i was visiting family! the  cottage is charming, but the company was absolutely the best part. if you have a chance to meet such beautiful people as toby and joe, you absolutely should.we had a late arrival, i kept in contact with toby and joe who waited up for us and gave us the complete intro to the cottage with\\r\\nbig smiles and welcome arms.  they offered hospitalty, food, beverages and access to both anytime we wanted.  (the oranges were delicious)  everything was neat and in order.  they could not have been more welcoming and we shared deleitful chats throughout our stay.toby and joe\\'s san francisco home was the final destination on our trip and we were so happy that we got to stay with them. from the moment we walked in we were greeted with warmth and welcome. toby and joe made sure that we were well oriented with the space and their home. they also made sure that we were well fed, had directions and that the car was parked in the right spot. it was such a treat staying with them -  kind, compassionate and interesting people. our only regret is that we didn\\'t converse with them more! this cottage is really a very charming place, clean and with all that is necessary for a nice and quiet stay. the hosts, toby and joe were very welcoming and accommodating, they provided great tips of places to visit and how to get around the city, they made me feel at home.  toby and joe were gracious hosts. they were welcoming even though we arrived quite late. the cottage was cozy, clean and warm.  the garden is beautiful and nice to wake to.   we had access to the kitchen where water was always available, as well as tea and a variety of snacks.   we enjoyed chatting with the both of them. we spent much of our time in bernal heights, an eclectic neighbourhood with cool shops and great cafes. the running on bernal heights hill was fab.oasis of tranquillity for reflection and  renewal in a very central area\\r\\ngreat welcome and thoughtful hospitality\\r\\n our stay at toby and joe\\'s was amazing! the cottage is perfect, very comfortable and cosy and the garden outside is lovely to sit with a cup of coffee in the morning and plan your day of exploring. the kitchen is always available to make tea, coffee, have some biscotti, bottled water and fresh oranges. it\\'s such a nice treat. \\r\\nbernal heights is a great suburb, funky cafe\\'s and good bar\\'s. also its super close to walk to mission which is such a great suburb. easy to get the bus to and from anywhere. \\r\\neveryday when we left the place and came back, toby and joe were there smiling and asking us about our day. it was so nice to come back to familiar faces and it really did feel like a little home away from home. they are truly kind and generous people and we feel really lucky to have had the chance to meet them and stay in their beautiful home. we\\'ll be back. toby and joe were wonderful hosts and some of the most genuinely nicest people we have ever met. we were treated like family from the moment we walked in to the second goodbyes we had when we left. the welcome package that greets you and the amazing art that covers the premises, the word \"charming\" is  an understatement. we wish we had more time to enjoy their company during our busy schedule, but we will make sure to visit  them again when we are in the area.the cottage in the back of toby\\'s house and joe\\'s beautiful succulent garden is only half of the package: you get kitchen access, shower in the house in a own bathroom and the location was just perfect to feel not like a tourist! bernal heights is beautiful, so are toby and joe who we really enjoyed to meet around in and out the house whilst staying. they have my fullest recommendation! if in sf and not afraid of people: stay here! its truely unique and the art around the house and the vibe of its inhabitants can not be payed off. thanks so much for hosting us! lasse & carolinstaying in this cozy nest behind toby and joe\\'s house is the quintessential airbnb experience. you wanted an adventure with stories to share, didn\\'t you? you\\'re looking at it. toby and joe have surrounded themselves with art and beauty and they are very generous people for sharing that with me. \\n\\nthank you, toby and joe. i hope we can meet again soon!staying with toby and joe was such a great decision! my brother and i stayed with them in july, and it was our first time using airbnb and visiting san francisco. the cottage was adorable, and toby and joe supplied everything we needed and then some to make us feel at home. i loved seeing their artwork and staying up late talking with them about anything and everything. they are such lovely people and ideal hosts. i felt like i left two great friends in san francisco. what a treat to stay in toby & joe\\'s garden cottage --- a quiet oasis in the heart of the bernal heights neighborhood of sf. it was the perfect spot for us to relax and re-group from our finale of an epic cycle ride down the west coast. their cottage is super small & super comfortable; note that the private bath is separated (with just a (url hidden) make sure you\\'re ok with that.\\n\\ntoby & joe will make your stay just what you want it to be --- private & quiet or...if you\\'re as lucky as us, you\\'ll get some time to share life\\'s experiences with them. anyone would be lucky to find this location for a san francisco getaway! we hope to be back!what an amazing stay with toby and joe. their home is stunning, the cottage is super comfortable. they did everything they could to make us feel welcome and looked after us. it was like coming home to family. their knowledge and tips for the city were really helpful and spot on. i couldn\\'t recommend a stay here more highly. they are the king and queen of air bnb. toby and joe were wonderful hosts and staying with them with them added greatly to my enjoyment of san francisco. bernal heights is a quieter part of the city to retreat to at the end of the day with a great selection of restaurants, cafes and food stores just around the corner from garden cottage.\\r\\nand the cottage is indeed charming. for anyone looking for an alternative to a faceless hotel, either for a business of leisure trip, this is perfect. our stay with toby & joe was absolutely delightful! we wish we could have stayed longer, but we will definitely be returning to the cottage again! my husband & i felt right at home the entire time. toby & joe have a way of making you feel like family! the cottage itself is extremely cozy. and the artwork is just magnificent :-) the entire place has such character. to say we enjoyed it is the least! getting to know the sweet sweet couple over coffee & biscotti was such a treat. we will forever hold the conservations we shared in our hearts. toby & joe are two of the most interesting, genuine, kind-hearted people we have ever met. we look forward to seeing them again! if you get a chance to stay with these fine souls, you\\'re in for a treat! :-) we had an amazing stay with toby and joe,  bernal heights is a great neighbourhood and toby and joe made us feel right home in thier cottage and their community. i would not hesitate to stay with them again, they were fantastic and we couldn\\'t ask for better hosts for our stay in san francisco.  i would highly recommend them to anyone.we were very well received upon arriving at the garden cottage in prentiss street/mission area.  toby and joe are a very sweet couple who likes to meet new people.\\r\\ni think the description given were indeed accurate:  this is an old house and you need to know the doors to use, and how and when to lock them.  the cabin is not particularly spacious (but you can put luggage inside the house).\\r\\nhowever, if you\\'re not in need of express check-in/check-out and you enjoy meeting interesting people with roots in the area your visiting, you cannot ask for more.\\r\\ntoby and joe had time to speak to us, to give of themselves and also to hear about us.  this created an unforgettable experience for us, ending a 3 weeks vacation with a 4 nights stay in the cottage. \\r\\nthis place has so much atmosphere, highlighted by the fact that a lot of the art created by toby and joe are on display everywhere.   the nearby neighbourhood has what you need of bars and restaurants, and you can park your car for free outside (not that easy in all areas of sf, when we previously were in a russian hill appartment we had to pay the owner usd 20 pr night to use his spot).my friend and i spent 6 nights at toby and joe\\'s beautiful place. we felt so at home and welcome, and had plenty of privacy as well. the area is a bit away from downtown, and therefore has a lovely and local atmosphere with plenty of good places to eat and shop - and if you want to get to downtown it is well connected and takes no time. i would highly recommend a stay with toby and joe!these hosts are so good i stayed with them a second time and then extend my stay even further. it is just great being there. wonderful hosts. wonderful cottage. totally unique. warm, friendly, cosy and characterful. great neighborhood in one of the world\\'s top cities. toby and joe were extremely hospitable and ensured i always had everything i needed morning, noon, and night. they even went out of their way to order me a specific mineral water i enjoy while i stayed with them. the cottage was very comfortable allowing all the space i needed. toby and joe were the best! from the moment i arrived they made me feel immediately at home. they were full of helpful advice and made sure i had everything i needed to have a incredibly comfortable stay - including coffee, tea, cookies and fruit. i had the best time chatting with them about their art, their experiences as airbnb hosts and their exciting lives in san francisco, greece as well as their many wonderful world travels. their creativity is inspiring and it was a joy being able to make art i such a rich environment. i\\'m already thinking about my next visit!absolutely spectacular stay! the place was just as pictured, toby & joe were even more gracious than expected, the place really is magical! i would most certainly stay here again, and i think we\\'ll be keeping in touch in the meantime!\\r\\ni love how toby and joe set up their little but well-designed cottage. staying with toby and joe feels like home. they invited me to lunch with their friend. we had delicious local sandwiches and housemade soup together.  both of them are talented artists; they gave me a package of gifts, and i had a lot of inspiration from their work.\\r\\ni\\'ll definitely come back to visit them as friends when i go back to san francisco. toby and her husband were perfect hosts. the room was charming and very comfortable. they offer a rich slice of authentic san francisco culture!we had a wonderful experience staying with toby and joe. hosts have thought of everything to make you stay feel like home. cute garden room is the perfect break from a day of city life. can\\'t wait to visit again! my stay was nothing short of magical. from the moment i walked in, toby and joe both fully embraced me into their home and made me feel like i truly belonged. the cottage was very comfortable, and i slept like a baby cocooned in the beautiful down comforter provided. the garden itself is blooming with roses and beautifully cared-for succulents, thanks to joe\\'s green thumb, and toby\\'s wonderful art adorns the fencing. the view - the view! - from the staircase walking down to the cottage is amazing, and i admired it greatly. however, what makes this listing so magical is toby and joe, whose warmth and hospitality is unparalleled. i felt like i was visiting family, and was so sad to have to leave to return home. of all of my airbnb experiences, this one will stand out as one of my most memorable and i cannot recommend the cottage highly enough. thank you toby and joe for making my stay an absolute dream.we had a terrific experience at toby and joe\\'s place. the accommodations are unique and charming and the hospitality highly engaging, personal and fun. a visit to toby\\'s art studio is a must. to be surrounded by so much art and good vibes left us refreshed and inspired.the reservation was canceled 59 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this space is awesome and john is a perfect host!  i would definitely recommend the space and even rent it again! if you are looking for a fun, quirky event space, this is it. \\r\\n\\r\\nthere\\'s a great seating/entrance area in the front, a large open space in the middle--perfect for performances or a large dinner, and full kitchen in the back. the top floor has its own seating area, two bedrooms and a really cool trailer that\\'s set up with a bed. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe rented out the space for a bridal shower/bachelorette party, and it could not have been more perfect! we hosted a dinner for 18 women, and it was so nice not having to bring in our own dishes, cups, silverware and tablecloths. there\\'s also a projector screen which was ideal as we had a video we played for the bride-to-be. \\r\\n\\r\\nthat night we had 5 guests comfortably stay over (it could have easily slept even more) and everyone slept really well on the beds. \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you again, john, for helping us put on a great event!chickenjohn was a great host! quick to reply to inquiries, very accommodating and prompt. he let us check out the space in advance to make sure it fit our needs (we were hosting a design research workshop), and was there the day of to make sure we had everything set up the way we needed.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ll definitely rent from him again the next time i need a venue like his, and i highly recommend this venue to you as well.finding an event space in san francisco is a challenge. one you can afford. one where you can bring in your own booze, set up your own space, and even cook in a professional kitchen. (but beware, there is other chefs who rent time in the kitchen, so you will have company before 6pm, we had 4 chefs, luckily we did not have much prep to do.)\\r\\nwe had a post wedding party for 20, and it was fabulous. hook up your own ipod, set up your own tables with swaggar, candles, etc.\\r\\nbe aware you must rent the apartment up stairs if you want to stay past 10pm, or you much quiet down, and if you are smart you will rent the apartment in tandem with the event space so you can party the night away with your friends. \\r\\nwe had a blast.\\r\\nbe aware that the space is a bit on the funky/raw side, and needs to be \"prettied\" up by your helpers, we spent 3 hours on our set up. depends on how creative you want to get.\\r\\nhire a waiter/clean up person, you have to leave the space clean, we came back in the morning and did the clean up.  \\r\\n\\r\\nit is a killer space and we had a total blast, a very memorable night for our group.\\r\\nthanks chicken john !this space cannot be beat! see my review on the loft john also offers, i accidentally reviewed chez poulet there! \\r\\nanyway....i\\'m in love with this space and its creativity.  this space was perfect for our event. guests enjoyed the hip and unusual surroundings and it was fully equipped with lights, sound system, decor, to create the right mood. john was a great host - helped us find everything we needed. great host and awesome space! my boyfriend and i were really glad we rented this space for our daughters first birthday and baptism party. we had about 40-50 guests come and fit comfortably. john also allowed us to check in early to set up for the party. he set up tables, chairs, and table cloths the day before to make sure all our needs were met! he also stopped by to show us where everything is located, how to work the sound system, lights, etc. i loved everything about big space 4 travelers and would recommend it to family or friends. john was a great host. he was very friendly, accommodating and totally helped us get acquainted with the space. our room was clean and quirky in a great sf kinda way! location is great as well with easy access to the mission and close to the 101/280 interchange so you can hop on the freeway if you really need to log some miles. \\r\\n\\r\\ni look forward to visiting again! jbhad a great time in this very unique space at an event we hosted there for a few days for work. john was a fantastic and helpful host. the reservation was canceled 39 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.place was good value for the money.  we will definitely consider it for parties for a big group in the future.  we rented john\\'s house for a team offsite for about 20 people.   the space was perfect and john went out of his way to make sure we were all set for the day - from electronics, to a great chef, to furniture set up - he covered all bases.   i highly recommend this space to anyone who is looking for a unique place to host an event!we loved booking this space! we used it for our teams hq in a 48 hour film festival. it couldn\\'t have worked out better. when we arrived john and co had all of our beds set up for us upstairs and we took over the bottom area as a production room. john was really flexible with us and our odd requests. the eclectic location even made it into our film as it inspired our storyline. simple a great space to get creative in. thanks john!very unique place to stay in san fran.  it accommodated our large group perfectly and it was in a great location.  chicken john was a great host as well.  if you are looking for something \"different\", this is the place.  just make sure to read street signs when parking...this is a beautiful and unique space that was the ultimate san francisco location for a gathering of 15 friends to share a meal, laugh and be merry, and spend the night together. the sleeping accommodations were very comfortable and spacious. \\r\\n\\r\\njohn was a direct communicator with us about the space and showing us the works. \\r\\n\\r\\nafter booking the reservation, john informed me that a chef rents the commercial kitchen for prep during the day. we had agreed that he would be out of the kitchen between 3-4. there was 5-6 chefs that did not leave until 6pm and came back the next morning at 11am. although they were all very nice, the sense that we were inconveniencing them and they were inconveniencing us was palpable. also, the bathroom with a shower is off the kitchen, which proved to be awkward. just something to be aware of! john was quick to respond to our booking request and helped us make sure the place was set up and ready for our event before we arrived (even going so far as to improve the internet speed of the space to meet our needs). he was kind and easy to work with. we had a fun time with 20 engineers and designers building things, playing games, and slumber partying.we found chez poulet after visiting a long list of wedding venues that lacked the atmosphere and vibe that we were hoping for. the pictures do not do this place justice. as soon as we walked in we knew it was the perfect spot for us to celebrate our special day with our closest friends. john was extremely helpful leading up to the event and was always quick to respond and offered us much useful insight. the weekend of the wedding john went above and beyond even our wildest expectations and even though it wasn\\'t part of our contract he stepped in and helped with setup, during, and cleanup. our wedding was much less organized than we had planned it to be but johns foresight and generosity saved our day. this place has so much to offer, our guests can\\'t stop raving about how unique every thing was, from the decor to the gorgeous front room. john is a really interesting and wonderful host.me and my fiancée are looking for a venue to host a reception, john answered to us quickly, everything went well.we held our wedding here and would absolutely recommend it as a wedding venue. our guests loved it and we loved it. there\\'s a parking lot nearby with very reasonable rates. some of our guests use wheelchairs and had no problem with accessibility. the gleaming floor, giant chandelier, and so many other unique features were charming. our host was gracious and accommodating, with great recommendations! the space was great, not only interesting but accommodating. perfect for our dinner party and usage of the property was well documented as to how best to work with the commercial kitchen. worked out well for our group.i was feeling a bit overwhelmed with the daunting task of organizing a dinner party for a friend\\'s 30th birthday party of around 20 people.  john was unbelievably helpful and welcoming from start to finish and made me feel at ease right away.  he went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, ensure there was enough seating, and even had a few flowers set up on the table for us.  he provided us with affordable caterer recommendations that far exceeded my expectations with their beautiful and delicious meal they provided.  the birthday boy couldn\\'t stop saying how he felt like a celebrity with a huge smile on his face the entire evening.  i really can\\'t thank john enough for providing us such a beautiful space and would recommend him and his home to everyone.the house was just was expected and john, the host, was great to work with. he was responsive, flexible, and very helpful with whatever we needed or i had questions on. the space is cooky, as you would suspect from the pictures, and worked well for our needs of somewhere to have a company meeting that didn\\'t feel corporate. we would use this space again.john was extremely accommodating and the space far exceeded our expectations. we were beyond impressed with his flexibility and the fact that such an incredible place even exists. john was great- super quick to respond and easy to coordinate with. he let us stop by to check out the event space before we booked. just lovely!we held our family reunion at john\\'s place.  there were 23 of us, ages 3-65, half adults, quarter teenagers, quarter children.  we stayed for 5 nights.  we rented both chez poulet and chez noeuf. \\r\\n\\r\\nmy main concern going in was how the bathroom facilities could possibly handle 23 of us.  we set a strict 10 minute limit and a \"bear away what you bring\" rule.  everything was totally fine.  next worry involved the sleeping accommodations.  but everyone was perfectly comfortable.  the kitchen is efficient, equipped to the teeth and communal meals for a crowd were a cinch.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe kids absolutely loved the place.  the teenagers liked the proximity to bart.   the adults loved that the kids were happy to hang out there.  i loved the neighborhood.  nobody loved the parking, so we never used our cars.  that easy.  the general ambiance is quirky, eccentric yet totally human.  reminds me of my college days.  \\r\\n\\r\\nbut really, the thing that pushes my rating from an a to an a++ is john rinaldi.  he was there when we needed him and not there when we didn\\'t.  he anticipated and met all of our needs.  promptly and effectively.  i thank him deeply for helping to make our reunion a success.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat a unique san francisco experience! definitely worth checking out this cool space - thanks for having us! my husband and i used this space you house our bridal party during our wedding weekend, and for our rehearsal dinner. it functioned perfectly for both uses and was a very unique and fun location. parking is the worst part, but if you can get past that, the venue is very neat. there is only one shower--which is located in the kitchen with the laundry--so that can make things interesting with a large group, but there are, at least, two toilets. the commercial kitchen (fully stocked with appliances, cutlery, linens, dishes, etc.) made it the perfect place to have our rehearsal dinner. there were plenty of beds and bedding available to sleep 20 people. overall, the space is a peculiar, quirky, fun building that made for a great weekend with friends. :)john was phenomenal. he proactively offered to get a table and chair setup that worked for our event (team offsite). he made sure we had access to power and a/v equipment. there were snacks and fresh coffee. all around a fantastic host.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space was exactly as expected — spacious, functional, unique. it\\'s right around the corner from lots of great restaurants and bars, after we finished our event we just walked down the street and had an excellent dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely use the space again for similar events.this is probably the best airbnb experience we\\'ve ever had as a family. john was so welcoming and engaging, sharing musical instruments and activity recommendations. our boys were thrilled with the space...each with a sleeping area unique to their personalities. the swinging rope delighted our 7 year old - even i had a go! the kitchen was amazing - a commercial kitchen with all the necessary equipment for fixing a feast! we took advantage of the great sound system and projector for family movie time. the neighborhood was vibrant. we only regret not getting to spend more time in this space. it\\'s definitely an event space, not a typical apartment, but was really suited to our eccentric family. everyone had no trouble imagining living in a space like this one. it was truly a magical experience for our family. i hope we\\'ll visit san francisco again, if only to stay here! \\r\\n\\r\\nsome other perks: a whimsical back yard, complete with working claw-door tub, the shower was totally fantastic (constructed with stone walls and double heads), there was a giant commercial coffee maker, and the best coffee (ritual) we had this entire vacation.  there was so much to do in this space, no one really wanted to leave. \\r\\n was such a gracious host, we hope to visit again soon!john was a great host. he was finishing up cleaning the place when we arrived, and was accommodating to show us around the space and then we settled in as he finished making some beds. there were ample couches and chairs to keep us comfortable downstairs and lots of space upstairs for sleeping. the place was clean and organized, well labeled and extremely convenient. i highly recommend this to any group of people looking for a convenient location for a weekend up in the city! we live nearby and used the space for a weekend for visiting guests and two small/medium sized events. everyone was very impressed with the cool and quirky space. john was very welcoming and exceptionally helpful. i highly recommend this space.we had a great corporate meeting over two days and john was supper helpful. the place was very cool and eclectic! we enjoyed staying at a place that was not a normal hotel. very cool place to see a different part of city. nothing new to say here! great space, responsive host, happy to have some of my money going to support a building and organization that supports creativity and the arts. carpe diem, folks. john took great care of us and ensured that we had a successful event. he was easy to communicate with and made sure that i understand the space before and after booking. the space itself was perfect for our event and would be suitable for a wide range of needs. john took the time to show me everything about the space, from the lights, to music, to the kitchen, and even brewed us coffee so we were all good to go!the reservation was canceled 210 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.great space, great host!this was a great place for our group of 6 to stay in sf for a work conference. bedding was comfortable, and the space was eclectic and artsy. the location was perfect - just 3 blocks from bart, and a walgreens across the street. it is also just a few blocks from the best burrito on the planet at la taqueria! there are 2 bathrooms but only 1 shower, so if you are with a group just be prepared to plan around that for mornings. the loft space where all of the bedrooms and other sleeping spaces are located does have some low-hanging beams that cross through the space, so you need to duck a bit to pass through the large open space, but this was a minor quirk that somehow just added to the funky charm of this great building. john also has a huge record collection and record player on the loft level - nice addition! having a washer and dryer on site was really nice. john was friendly, very responsive, and even let us leave our luggage on site until late afternoon on the day we checked out so that we could just pick it up on our way to the airport. this would be an amazing space for a large party or dinner gathering as well -- incredible large kitchen, beautiful large meeting room, great lighting options, and a good sound system. we had an unforgettable evening at john\\'s space. the pictures don\\'t even do this place justice, it\\'s incredible. john\\'s team helped set up and he kept in constant contact to make sure we had everything we needed. he set up plenty of beds so our large group of 17 could sleep comfortably. it was easy to get in and out of, and provided plenty of space for a giant slumber party. this is a great rental for large groups at an unbeatable rate.john is super responsive and very transparent in all of the details. we held our wedding reception at chez poulet and it was perfect.  john was incredibly accommodating and went far beyond our expectations in helping us plan and execute the event.  we had a musician, a dj, a bar, and catering.  john found wonderful and professional staff to help at reasonable rates.  the bartender oliver was terrific and my only regret is that we didn\\'t exploit his mixology skills (we had beer and wine only).  the house manager valerie was wonderful, and did an outstanding job in setting up the dining area, helping to keep the catering warmed in ovens, and busing tables.  john himself helped out a ton at the event, and worked the sound for the musician.  i can\\'t over emphasize how pleased we were with event.  everyone had a great time, will have great memories, and many will probably stay at or use chez poulet in the future.  \\r\\n\\r\\nif you plan an event here, john will help.  he wants everyone to have a successful event and joyous occasion.  thank you john, valerie, and oliver!\\r\\n\\r\\njohn was very helpful in booking this reservation. i needed to book a last minute team outing for a small team in our company. he was very helpful with setting it up and understanding our needs especially so last minute.john made us feel very welcome and he made sure we had everything we needed. we stayed at his place with 4 adults and 7 children. we all had enough room and it was a very special place to stay. local to transport and some good restaurants. we would certainly stay again when in san franciscothe reservation was canceled 10 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.absolutely wonderful venue!!!

it\\'s so funky and fun and has so much character and is also warm and inviting.  i wanted a big space for after my wedding where me and my new husband and all our bridal party could be together and this was so perfect.  the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.my group had the best time at this space! it was funky and cool, but clean and comfy at the same time. we loved the bed set up, record player, and sound system downstairs. also, the shower was a thing of beauty. \\n\\nastra was wonderful to work with - she made sure we knew how everything worked and gave us some excellent suggestions on what to do around town. \\n\\na truly unique space in a unique and upcoming community. i would highly recommend, especially for sizable groups!awesome space and awesome event. astros, the event assistant was super helpful!john and astra did an amazing job communicating with us, made us feel more than welcome and above all helped us throw a great party.love this space!

the outside furniture is lovely and we were able to sit there enjoying some wine. the only thing missing for us since we were two families, was a tv upstairs and at least one full length mirror downstairs. also, although the furnishings are lovely the walls are very bare and make the house look a bit cold. but the house is beautiful, pristine and comfortable!\\r\\nstayed at jay and tina\\'s place with my team for a week and everyone loved it. great location and amazing home, better than on the pictures!this has been an incredible experience for the 9 of us who stayed at jay\\'s house for the week. the place was spotless, beautifully renovated, very well equipped, communication was fast and efficient, and most of all, jay has been very helpful, thoughtful and always available when needed. great neighborhood and great house, super great hosts!

the apartment is bigger than we thought it would be and the views are more spectacular than we imagined! we especially loved the roof top deck, especially with a glass of wine. the neighborhood is perfect! quiet and withing walking distance to a lot of restaurants, shops, and of course the bay is right in front of you. me only complaint is that we only stayed one night! side note to be aware of, the building is old and full of character, with that said the floors creak pretty loud. wasn\\'t much of an issue for us but could be for a light sleeper. this was our first time staying at a airbnb. the instructions to enter the condo were detailed and complete. the views were spectacular! the condo was spacious. the heater did not work in one room our first night and the pillow home people delivered a room heater the next day. very efficient. i liked that is was empty of clutter with plenty of space to put our things away. it was 3 flights of stairs up. the chairs were worn out, but comfortable. loved the view, and being so close to the marina green, physically a few steps away, and visually, always right there. very spacious, bright, sunny, and . . . the view is absolutely fantastic! this place is within walking distance to some of the best shops and restaurants in all of sf. this space is one of very few with 2 bedrooms + 2 full bathrooms. it is nice when you are taking a trip with others to have not just your own bedroom, but also your own bathroom. lots of windows, panoramic 180 degree view of gold gate bridge on the left, alcatraz on the right, the marina green, and a roof deck where you can get a 360 degree view of the entire area of this amazing city. marina green is right in front of you, visible from the 3rd floor, and the beautiful bay behind it. you can people watch right from the living room, with privacy. marina is the perfect area to be in sf. i would not want to be anywhere else. you are near the water and near some of the most beautiful parts of the city. marina has some of the most beautiful homes in all of sf. the apartment is so centrally located, you feel like you are in the center of everything even if you are just housebound. for the firs part of our trip, my mom was dealing with back pain and my dad had been nursing a cold. so they couldn’t get out much the first day. they both felt like sitting in the living room, with all the marina activity, seeing the sailboats and ships pass by, and the people playing soccer out on the green, made them feel a part of it all. the apartment is on the 3rd floor of a building of really nice people. it is an easy trip up. sean has the place so that it is outfitted nicely with what you need, and at the same time, he manages to clear out the space, i guess, that it does not feel like someone lives there on a regular basis. in other words, the place is very free of his personal items, free of clutter of life. modern furnishings and space surround you. as for indoor entertainment for late night tv watching, internet surfing or working on your laptop -- tv reception and wifi were excellent, with a great variety of cable and channels. there was keurig with plenty of coffee, tea, lots of nice snacks, extras. plenty of clean white towels, hangars, and space for your clothes. sean is the perfect host. he is warm, open to accommodating anything you need. we were flying back to houston and got rained out. our flights got cancelled. sean made us feel comfortable knowing that we would have a place to stay, his place again, if we needed it, for one or even a few nights. whatever we needed, he was happy to help us...sean was great! he provided detailed instructions on how to access the apartment and everything it offers.  the apartment itself is perfect. exactly as pictured with some of the best views of san francisco.  the rooftop deck is just one flight up with an amazing view. i would highly recommend sean and his apartment to anyone visiting the area! great apartment ,great view ,and great location\\nbeds comfortable, kitchen equipped and apartment clean\\nonly issue is that keys to front door didn\\'t work very well.\\nwould book again\\nsean\\'s place was awesome!! loved it! especially the top deck with panoramic views of the bay area. the views & location is what makes this place a standout. sean made it very easy for us to find our way in to the apartment & gave us loads of information about where to go & what to see. sean was a great host -- he provided us with very clear instructions to access the unit, and even offered to let us check in early. the unit was impeccably located, clean and well-stocked. we had a great time staying here and would definitely come again!great place. fantastic views! sean was great to deal with sean was absolutely fantastic, his house was lovely. marina neighborhood was quaint, the views from the roof were amazing at sunset, especially looking out to alcatraz and golden gate bridge. sean is a terrific host, and it was truly a pleasure to stay at his home. the apartment was exactly as it appeared in the pictures. the location and view were spectacular and the art deco building had so much more charm then a generic mod hotel room.  just steps from the bay and 3 blocks to chestnut street where you can find great restaurants and shops.janaf has a beautiful place at an amazing price for the location.  walking distance to restaurants, great coffee/cafes, everything we needed during our stay. her house is very spacious and clean, nice furnishings, quiet and comfortable. the bedroom is exceptionally nice with great sunlight and super comfortable beds. the private bathroom in our room was just perfect. the neighborhood was lovely and felt very safe to walk at night. we walked to the golden gate park and museums. we also walked to the beach and ate dinner at the beach chalet restaurant, great food and spectacular ocean views. janaf offered us two lounge chairs so that we could sit across the street and watch the sunset with a bottle of wine. beautiful view! across the street from her house is sunset blvd (no houses just trees, very pretty area) and a walking path to lake merced and the golden gate park. public transportation was great too and took us everywhere we needed to go. lots of bus lines accessible across the street from her house. we took the #71 bus to union square and hopped on a cable car to fisherman\\'s wharf. the next day we took the #29 bus to baker\\'s beach and walked towards the golden gate bridge. we couldn\\'t have asked for any better location to stay in san francisco. janaf was extremely helpful and a great, friendly host. we had a wonderful experience and would certainly return to janaf\\'s place. we really enjoyed ourselves. we took an airport shuttle back to the airport and was there in less than 20 minutes. i highly recommend a stay at janaf\\'s place. thanks janaf for being a warm, generous host.very clean.  the hosts were warm and welcoming.  they have made the master bedroom available so the restroom is accessible without going into a shared hallway and there\\'s no street noise to speak of.   parking is easily available and free.  wifi worked fine.   it\\'s about a four block walk to the n-judah streetcar.  if you are comfortable being in the outer sunset then this is highly recommended.  it was clean and quiet. janaf was very welcoming. she even wrote me a little welcome note for me. two beds are clean and comfortable. bathroom was also clean, and well furnished. there is a nice pho restaudant in 10 min walk or 3 min drive. i liked to have a cup of coffee at starbucks after having pho. it was a nice place to stay.janaf is a great lady that my parents and i had a wonderful place living at her home for five days. the house is super clean, organized and cute with beautiful decorations. janaf prepared everything for us in both bathroom, kitchen and the bedroom. she is a wonderful lady, mom and grandma! i also met her daughter and granddaughter, and both of them are super nice and kind.\\r\\n \\r\\npublic transportation is convenient and the house is close to a large shopping market and some chinese restaurants. \\r\\n\\r\\nanyway if i get another chance visiting sf in the future, i will definitely stay there again!we had a wonderful stay with janaf in a great area in san francisco. she was a helpful and respectful host and completely took care of us. the location is perfect with the golden gate park just 15 minutes away on foot and the 71 and 29 buses are right in front. the room and bathroom are spacious and include all you need. a great place!we had with other girls great 2 days in janaf´s house. she was great. she gave us small snacks every day and she was friendly, nice, great ;) we can agree with her about everything ;) she was simply perfect ;)\\r\\n\\r\\nshe cares about us as about her own kids ;)\\r\\n\\r\\nit was pretty nice.we stayed at janaf\\'s lovely and beautiful house for two nights. janaf is very kind and sweet host. she kept her house so clean and comfortable. i love the garden. janaf\\'s house is 10-15ms walk to the ocean beach, 10ms walk to shops and delicious chinese and vietnamese restaurants. if you have car, it will be very easy to get to town, even no car, 71 bus and 29 bus is just around the corner, that can take you to downtown  in about 30-40ms.janaf was so nice and kind.  the room was beautiful and the house was near everything-- so we used pubic transportation.  definitely a great find! wonderful house and a very quiet location. janaf\\'s hospitality was beyond what we expected. thoroughly enjoyed our stay.janaf was a fabulous, thoughtful, warm and welcoming\\nhost.  loved our time with her in her beautiful home!janaf is the sweetest lady and wonderful host!! she kindly let us use her garage to store our bikes and she was extremely sweet with my daughter. janaf was such a wonderful host! her home is beautiful and centrally located to public transit and the water! three of us stayed for a weekend in her home and she provided valuable information about the transit system, a warm hospitable environment, and refreshing morning tea and fruit. we came and went as we pleased as she provided us with our own key. i highly recommend this stay to everyone :) thanks for a wonderful experience janaf!janaf was an amazing host! she went out of her way to accomodate us. in addition, janef is a lovely, upbeat, enthusiastic woman who loves where she lives and loves san francisco. the room was perfect, and a fantastic location especially if you are spending time in golden gate park, the sunset, ocean beach etc. we walked everywhere.\\r\\nmy husband and i would absolutely return to stay with janaf.janaf was very welcoming! the room is exactly as it is posted in the pictures and was clean and comfortable. janaf is a very warm and hospitable host. she did everything in her power to made our stay a pleasant one. the room was quitte small and could not manage the stay of our family (two adults and two older children). we needed one more sleeping place and janaf herself came with a solution. she also let us put our bags in her living room so that we had more space in the bedroom.janaf is a very warm host. we arrived in her place a little late and woke her up. sorry about that. she left bread, fruits and eggs on the table the next morning. she even made tea for us. thank you for making us feel at home, janaf! we had a nice chat in the morning right after we felt earth quake in sf. i really like her altitude towards her life. \\r\\n\\r\\nher place is very clean and close to several bus stops. i would highly recommend her place.   \\r\\nour first experience with airbnb was very positive and janaf contributed to this success. her place is nice and clean and beat of all, the bed is comfortable!\\njanaf took great care of us explaining little things about the city that made our discovery of the city easier. janaf was a very friendly and helpful host. the room, and the whole house, were wonderful. overall a very warm and welcoming place to explore the city from. we couldn\\'t have hoped for better.we had a bedroom with our own bathroom and janaf is a very nice person. she does everything to make you feel at home! and she made us lovely delicious breakfasts.always helpfull and very friendly! she has got the airbnb fever!! i would recommend this place highly!we had a great time staying with janaf in san francisco. janaf made us feel very welcome and the room was clean, quiet and comfortable. the small breakfast on our last day was a very nice touch. the location may be slightly out of the way for some, but there are good transport links so we were able to get around just fine. a nice experience and definitely recommended if you are looking for nice place to stay in san fran.janef is a great host.  the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the neighborhood is great.  most of all janef was very accommodating  and enthusiastic.  we would stay here again.janaf was such a great host.  her accomodations were clean and comfortable and easy to find.  my friend and i were in town for a concert and she told us how to get there on the bus, but the bus wasn\\'t coming and i thought maybe we were trying to catch it in the wrong place so we crossed the street.  she was leaving her house at the time and picked us up to drive us to where we would catch the connecting bus!  if it wasn\\'t for her we would have missed the concert.  i couldn\\'t have asked for a better host!!\\r\\njanaf was nice and accommodatingit was so nice to stay at janafs house!she was really taking care of us!the room was nice an big enough for us two.everything was great!thank you janaf for sharing your house with us!this place was very good and clean. the room is equipped with a private and beatiful bathroom. janet was a good host, she gave us shampoo, shower gel and a huge number of san francisco brochures and maps. we had some problems with the wifi at the beginning but she quickly fixed it and the last day she prepared also the breakfast for us! se suggest this place.janaf is very nice,she make me live her room like home.  房子位置很好,离金门公园和金门大桥都很近。停车非常方便。房东非常热情,善良,喜欢小孩。我们一起度过了美好的时光,非常感谢janaf提供的一切。janaf was accommodating and the room was exactly as described, with a great ensuite bathroom. location is great, with public transit just across the street.janaf is a friendly and hospitable host and the room is more or less as shown in the photographs.  it is, however, smaller than it appears and is just barely large enough for a couple. the listing shows a house on 36th avenue which is nothing like the actual house which is smaller, older and narrower with some steep steps to the front door.  the house itself is quite small and dark and we were not shown how to access the garden.  the free parking is street parking.  we did not find the range of local cafes and restaurants mentioned - there were a number of low-key asian restaurants around but that was all. sunset boulevard is a busy and dusty road.  it is a long way from downtown - there is a direct bus but it takes a very long time.  for the price we paid i expected something much better and overall was disappointed.janaf 是个很好的房东,对我们很耐心,她的房间非常温馨,为房客考虑得很周到。我们有任何问题她都及时提供帮助。走不多远就有超市可以采购所需。附近还有华人餐厅吃饭喝茶很方便。janaf is a good host.she is really nice and patient.her room is very comfortable and clean.and not far away from the ocean beach.we have pleasant days in san francisco.janet was a kind and welcoming host.  the room was just like the pictures described. comfortable and clean.janef is a beautiful host - i will defo stay again :) thank you janaf was a wonderful host. lovely room in a beautiful home, incredibly clean and comfortable (and the big dresser and private bathroom was a real plus!) great neighborhood with easy walk to restaurants, very cool bakery/coffee shop nearby. plenty more to explore but we weren\\'t there for a long stay, but we really appreciated all the san fran maps and guidebooks in the room. in the morning janaf made us tea and a delicious feast of all kinds of fruit, juices, yogurt and more. we\\'d love to stay there again.my wife and i stayed one night. janaf met us at the door and was very welcoming. the home is clean and the bedroom is as bright and comfortable as the photo appears. there is an ensuite bathroom and provided with all expected toiletries.  the location is close to the ocean, zoo, and public transport. it was quiet. we could use the kitchen if we wanted. tenants should be prepared that she may be staying in the home with you. this was not a problem for us.janaf had a wonderful home.easy to find.good location to access ocean or any golden gate park activities. sunset dist area was lots of fun with great  shops and food.everyone we met were very cool. very quiet area! janaf was very kind and attentive and will help you find whatever you need..thanks janaf!janaf’s home was just what we were looking for – quiet, clean, safe and with offstreet parking available in her driveway.  the room is exactly as pictured, and was certainly big enough for the two of us, with closet space for hanging clothes, and an additional bed (which was handy for spreading things out on.) the ensuite bathroom was comfortable and clean; although i didn’t experiment with it, the tub looked like it had a whirlpool feature. our bedroom overlooked a pleasant garden in the back of the house, so there was no street noise; if we wanted to sleep in, we could.  we were in san francisco to visit friends, and to attend the dickens christmas faire, so we didn’t spend a lot of time in the house, and only saw janaf in the mornings, when she cut up exotic fruit for us to supplement the breakfast foods we’d brought.  (if you are particular about your coffee, i’d suggest bringing your own; there is an extensive selection of teas but only instant coffee available; she is not a coffee drinker.)  several restaurants, and the grocery store, are a short walk away.  if you want to stay right in the middle of downtown, or the haight, this might not be your best option.  but if you want a quiet refuge to return to after a busy day visiting or seeing the sights, it’s perfect.   we really enjoyed our stay.this was my first stay somewhere with airbnb.  janaf was a very gracious host.  she was very accommodating and made us feel right at home.  it was a quick stay for myself and two of children ages 18 and 14.  we were in town to visit stanford and wanted to tour the city of san francisco.  though we could have taken public transportation (apparently there is a bus stop a block or so from her house) i was glad i had a rental car.  it was definately needed to get to most areas you want to see as a tourist.  the neighborhood seemed a bit run down and i\\'m not sure i would have felt completely safe to walk anywhere.  the room had a queen size bed as well as a twin bed.  it also had its own bathroom.  it was clean and tidy.  there also was a number of brochures for tourist attractions in the city which i found helpful.  i have a prior back injury and found the bed to be a bit hard for my liking.  but i did sleep pretty well.  we were tired for all our traveling.  we left by 9am the following morning so we basically just slept there.  janaf had wonderful stories and offered us some organic juice to start our day.  she is a very sweet lady who really cares about \"her city\".   great experience! the host even offered a breakfast!janaf makes you feel welcome from the instant you walk into her lovely home. my son and i were greeted with a smile and a beautiful platter of fresh fruit for breakfast! it was such a kind gesture and definitely set the tone for our entire stay. the room is cozy, with comfortable beds and a clean and updated bathroom. the room is private, with lots of natural light, a large closet with plenty of hangers and large mirror doors. the mattresses are heavenly, we slept like babies! the location is close to bus stops, walking distance to the beach and even the golden gate park. i highly recommend janaf, not only for her kind demeanor, but because of her attention to detail and sincere care for her guests and their comfort while at her home. we will be returning to visit her without a doubt!janaf and her home were absolute perfection! not only is the room extremely comfortable and the bathroom well stocked with any necessary toiletry, janaf is also incredibly welcoming! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe first morning we awoke to a friendly and happy janaf that had breakfast waiting for us in her adorable dining room. all throughout the trip, she made sure that we were always comfortable. she also let us store our rented bikes in her garage, which was so nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is beautiful and felt very safe. there is a really good bar/restaurant called the spot lounge nearby, not to mention the amazing golden gate park!\\r\\n\\r\\ni loved staying with janaf! it felt like a home away from home. i highly recommend her home and company to everyone.janaf was very nice. the place is very clean and comfortable. like the pictures you see. very edvisable. thank you so much janaf!janaf was very welcoming and kind - she always checked up on us to make sure everything was ok and asked if we needed anything. personally though, i much prefer keeping to myself so it probably wasn\\'t the best fit as i was constantly worried if i was being rude.\\n\\nher home was clean, albeit, a little overwhelming for me because she has a lot of stuff! everything was organized and very pretty but i felt like i would break something with a wrong turn. the room was smaller than i thought and parking, although available, was either a tight squeeze to the front of her garage or on the street (which was plentiful).\\n\\nthere wasn\\'t as much in her neighborhood as i thought there would be and next time, i think i will look for lodging inside the actual city of sf. while her location was good, you still needed to drive to the city and parking is a pain. alternatively, you can take the bus but my time was limited so that wasn\\'t an option.\\n\\nit was a good stay and as someone new to air b and b, i\\'m glad to have found janaf!our stay at janaf\\'s place was very pleasant. the house was well kept and very clean. janaf made us feel at home right from the beginning and treated us like her own kids. we couldn\\'t have hoped for a better experience and we hope we will cross paths again soon!! :)\\xa0our hostess, janaf, was very outgoing and accommodating.  her home is filled with many family pictures and remembrances.  \\r\\nit was nice to have a good sized room with an en-suite bathroom and a private parking space.  the home was very close to sunset blvd. so it was very easy to drive to nearby locations.  we heard no traffic noise but my wife said she could hear the surf at night.\\r\\neach morning, janaf provided breakfast \"fixins\".  we could prepare our own cooked breakfast from what she provided or have fruits and cereal.  she only has tea and instant coffee but we were able to brew decaf coffee in her drip coffee pot.\\r\\nwe\\'ll check in on our next trip to san francisco!it was an awesome feeling staying at janaf\\'s place. she treated us just like family members and made our stay very warmth. it was very nice of janaf to set snacks and breakfast table for us. she made our stay very memorable. thank you!this review is for my mom who stayed at janaf\\'s home during her visit to san francisco. janaf was reassuring to me before my mom arrived, and was incredibly helpful and welcoming to her. the house is lovely, and convenient to public transportation. my mom had a beautiful suite with two beds and her own private bathroom. each morning, janaf offered breakfast. in the room you will find brochures regarding restaurants, transportation, shopping, and activities to do in the area. it was a pleasant experience for myself and my mom, and i would recommend janaf\\'s home to anyone visiting san francisco. thank you, janaf!we had a wonderful stay at janaf\\'s home.  unfortunately, janaf had had to leave town unexpectedly, so we did not get to meet her, but she had made arrangements for her daughter to meet us when we arrived.  her daughter was very helpful and answered all our questions.  the room was great, with lovely bedding, and an attached bath with everything we needed.  it was at the back of the house and very quiet.  we had use of the kitchen to make coffee and tea and breakfast.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was great as we were able to walk to the deyoung museum and walk to some great restaurants in the area.  we love the outer sunset district and its closeness to the ocean, too.  \\r\\n\\r\\nour thanks to janaf to entrusting us with her lovely home in her absence.  hope we get to meet her next time!janaf is a very sweet person who has a beautiful home. the room she rented out to me was very comfortable and had style too. janaf also took time to make my short stay very easy and flexible through quick replies and short notes for important contact numbers. she also took the pains to make a very nice breakfast and it was a very good conversation that we had. looking forward to staying there soon.great stay at the cute cozy house. janaf was super welcoming and friendly. janaf is the best host i can ask for, she is always so welcoming, sweet and friendly. we had wonderful 3 nights at her lovely place. she prepared delicious breakfast for all of us, bread, eggs, fruits and tea. we are so glad to choose her place as our home at sf. her house locates at a beautiful neighborhood and  is 1 min\\'s walking to a lot of bus stops. thanks and xiexie, janaf!we had a very brief stay but janaf made us feel extremely welcome in her lovely home, but then just gave us a key and left us to our freedom, which was very appreciated.  she left us a nice snack to eat and was very kind, calling us her \"beautiful ladies\".  the beds were clean and very comfortable with several warm blankets and quilts.  the bathroom had hair tools, and other nice amenities.janaf kept in contact with us through our voyage through the bart and muni systems to her doorstep. she greeted us warmly when we arrived, and kept that warmth throughout our visit. her home was our home. the presence of close-by muni stops made a car unnecessary for our stay, and the two-bed arrangement was perfect for my and my father\\'s explorations of san francisco. breakfast was a help-yourself affair of yoghurt, fruit, and an available kitchen that served us fine. this is a great place to base your explorations.my friends and i stayed for 8 nights at janaf\\'s. her house is as described, clean and cozy in a quiet safe neighborhood in outer sunset. we drove, but there are bus stops nearby; the muni stop for the n-judah to downtown is a 3.5-block walk away. \\r\\n\\r\\njanaf made us feel very welcomed, making special arrangements for one of us wanting to stay in a separate room. amenities were good, wi-fi signal excellent, and the beddings nice and warm as it could get a bit chilly, being near the beach. strolling down ocean beach makes a great evening outing though, highly recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\npotential guests should note that janaf stays in (although she does not impose on guests in any unwelcome way), and we have found our bedroom window (that overlooks the back garden) opened, presumably for air, when we come back at the end of the day. \\r\\n\\r\\nother than this, we had no issues staying at janaf\\'s, who is an excellent host. \\r\\n\\r\\njanaf is a wonderful, kind hostess, making us feel right at home.  the location is convenient to getting anywhere in san fran, near beautiful parks, a walk to ocean beaches & more.  it\\'s a neighborhood atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room with a private bath was plenty of space & quiet.  we had everything we needed and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you janaf!  penny & victoriastaying in janaf\\'s home during my visit was a great experience. i was able to do a lot of sight seeing without having to travel too much and when i did have to take an uber or lyft, it was very cheap to get to the places i wanted to go because of the great location. i highly recommend staying with janaf in her beautiful home because she is very welcoming, caring, and can give you a lot of advice on where to go explore and how to get there! janaf was very welcoming and gracious.  she was flexible about my arrival time and helpful with my last- minute phone calls.  she went out of her way to make me feel at home.  the room and bathroom were very clean, and the larger bed where i slept was firm and comfortable.  janaf even prepared the room for my bedtime- the curtains were drawn and the lamp was on when i returned after an evening out!  the location is walking distance to the ocean and a cool coffee shop named devil\\'s teeth, where i went every morning after a long, good sleep.janaf was such a sweet host! she was caring for all three of us, and made us feel at home. the house itself is lovely, and you can definitely see that she cares about cleanliness and comfort. nice place to live in! my family felt so comfortable and warm to live in. thanks for sharing the house with us. near the house, we can chose bus or metro to go to downtown and other places, such as the fisherman\\'s wharf or the golden gate. we really enjoyed the day when we lived there! janaf made sure that she was there to welcome us when we arrived.  the room was very clean and having our own bathroom was very convenient.  she offered us snacks to take with us every time we left the house for the day and we had tea with her the morning we left.  parking our car was extremely convenient and the neighborhood was safe and quiet.  would stay here again!we really enjoyed our stay at janaf\\'s home. she was very accommodating, warm, and welcoming. she made us a yummy breakfast and made sure we felt comfortable and at home. her home is very lovely. our room was comfortable with plenty of space and had a nice view that overlooked a pretty garden. she lives in a great part of the city that is close to golden gate park, ocean beach, and lots of cute restaurants and cafes. you even can see a nice view of the water from her living room. i definitely would recommend her to others.  wonderful house! the host was very kind and referred her house as our house. we had some nice chat and overall is very good.janaf was extremely kind and accommodating; she made everything about our stay seem nice and \"at home.\" she\\'s certainly one of the more engaged airbnb hosts i\\'ve met. her house was pleasant enough and plenty clean, and in a very good location as well--just a few blocks from the beach.we were looking for a private bathroom, 2 beds, and available parking, and we found all this in janaf\\'s house, as it was advertised. the location is perfect, close to a beach, park, and 10 minutes car drive from the golden gate bridge. janaf was very nice host, and we felt like at our home.  excellent place to rent. thank you janaf for treating as as part of your family. janaf could not have been kinder or more welcoming.  in-driveway parking is very convenient; the room was clean and comfortable.\\r\\nthe location was perfect for us, just a couple minutes to the beach, golden gate park, and usf.  we would definitely recommend this to anyone.janaf made us feel welcome right from the moment we met. after a long day of travel she quickly showed us our quaint room with attached bathroom and the rest of the space, so that we could relax and unwind. the room was filled with personal touches that made it seem like we were staying with a relative which is a nice feeling especially in a new city. the location of the space is near golden gate park but we chose to drive there instead of walk as it is a little ways away. there was parking available on the driveway of the home and on the street as well so that was nice to have. not knowing san francisco we thought we would be closer to downtown but that was our oversight not janaf\\'s issue. it was easy to get around just took us 10-15 min due to traffic. the space was quiet at night and all the amenities were just what we needed. we enjoyed our stay and want to say thank you for making us feel so at home! we appreciated the snack on the morning of our departure as it was early and wouldn\\'t have time to stop before our flight. thanks again!janaf was very welcoming and immediately made us feel at home, giving us watermelon & ginger ale when we got in after a long day of travelling. she was a lovely host & very accommodating.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room itself was great - had a single & a double bed & en suite with bath / shower. and we had full use of the kitchen. parking was a prerequisite for us & there was ample around here (for free)! location-wise we were near away from the city centre & near the ocean... if only i done more research & known you could have surfed from very nearby...\\r\\n\\r\\nfound some great spots to eat nearby too... third time i\\'d been to san francisco & the first time i\\'d been to this (the sunset) area - a nice change.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in, a great place for a quiet start to the trip.janaf is a wonderful and warm host, and her home is clean, quiet, and located in a lovely safe neighborhood, close to the beach and public transportation. we loved our stay here and recommend janaf\\'s home highly! nice stop in sf. clean and welcoming. thanks janefjamal was extremely welcoming and wanted to ensure we had a great time during out two night stay. she offered advice when we asked and even woke up to make us breakfast on our final day before we left. she makes you feel like family. the room was as described in the listing. jana was very warm and inviting although we only had about 30 mins together as our trip was pretty much planned out to maximize our time with our daughter.it\\'s a home away from home! janaf was great.  loved having a place to park the car.  janaf made us feel at home and we enjoyed talking with her when we got the chance.  janaf is very kind and friendly. her house is beautiful and located in safe and clean neighbourhood. beach is just 10 minutes by walk and bus stop 2 minutes. the room was clean and everything was prepared for us. also the room has its own bathroom.  we had a wonderful experience staying at janaf\\'s place. the location was good and close to bus stop. we had a variety of food options. the room was lovely and comfortable. parking space was also a privilege staying at sf. janaf was so nice and thoughtful and we felt like home staying with her.our host greeted us at the door and showed us to our room, modest and sufficient for our need.  we were there for one night and off at 9am the next morning. parking as mentioned was available for our rental car.   this was my first airbnb experience and janef really made it a good one! it was like coming home, with a very warm greeting and a healthy snack. her home is very sweet and clean and the room was exactly as pictured with comfortable beds and a clean private bath. the neighborhood is quiet and convenient, although not in the main \"heart\" of the city. it was located on main arteries, though, and close to the ocean and neighborhood cafes, and there was great parking for our rental car - something you can\\'t find in the city proper! it\\'s also not too far from the park and the golden gate bridge. i highly recommend janaf\"s place. and if you\\'re lucky, she\\'ll be cooking up a pot of her splendid split pea soup to warm you on a cool afternoon.janaf is a sweet, gracious host and her home is cozy and comfortable. easy access, beautiful setting and limited but good dining within walking distance. i hope to make my way to visit janaf and the sunset neighborhood again. excellent host who went out of her way to make us feel welcome and at home.  can not recommend a stay with janad enough,  she\\'s amazing.  contacting janaf beforehand to alert her of our arrival time assured us of her (and for that matter, her daughter - randa, granddaughter - ashley, and dog-zooey!) being there to receive us - which began our warm, welcoming experience. we were greeted with not only what we expected (per pictures and description), but additional amenities (local info/contacts, use of other areas such as living room, dining room, kitchen in case we wanted to have visitors).  our room w/private bath easily accommodated 3 adults. we rented a zipcar (only 2 blocks away) for which janaf had free unlimited parking in front of her house. we used muni to a couple places. also, our daughter flew into sfo and used bart & muni to/from janaf\\'s. we used a clean, modern laundromat (8-9 blocks away that had great hours). nearby restaurants, markets, even a safeway were all within walking distance.  golden gate park, the pacific, coastal trails and loads of things to see/do were easy to get to. situated close to mass transit, it is still in a safe, residential area.\\r\\n   not only would i highly recommend janaf\\'s home, but i hope someday to return - just to see janaf again.  she\\'s a lovely, giving lady who has had interesting life experiences of her own.janaf is very warm and we enjoyed our brief stay at her place. the location is convenient and quiet as well!it was our first airbnb experience and was just great! unfortunately we didn\\'t meet janaf due to her family reasons. but she did her best that we could feel as at home. nice and quiet location, private parking place, cozy house.we had a wonderful time at janaf\\'s classic san francisco home. she is the perfect hostess navigating that difficult space of being attentive yet offering privacy. the room and beds are comfortable. it\\'s a great location with the ocean nearby and free parking!  you will be happy you came and feel like you have visited a dear friend when you leave. i really like janaf and her apartment. she was very friendly and kind to host us despite we arrived a little bit late than previously scheduled. the room is not so big but very comfortable. she also hosted tasty breakfast/snacks. i would highly recommend her listing to others.we had our best time at janaf’s home. janaf gave us warm welcome and provided a very comfortable stay in san francisco. her home was well maintained and was well upto the airbnb description. also, janaf was very informative and helped us in commuting through san francisco. if we get a chance, we will visit again. “thank you janaf” for making our trip wonderful.really enjoyed the stay here. very cozy bedroom, but a little chilly.janaf is a  welcoming and outgoing spirit.\\r\\nour a room was a little crowded for two,but doable.\\r\\nwe use public transportation to get down town,about 45 minutes by bus(only 3mins. walk to bus stop) and 25 minutes with uber.\\r\\nthere are restaurants and grocery stores in walking distance. we purchased breakfast food ,but really didn\\'t need to as janaf either had ingredients we could use or she made a large breakfast for us. \\r\\nwe felt safe in the neighborhood ,in fact walked back from golden gate park and that  general area several times at night.\\r\\njanaf was wonderful! very helpful.  her house is beautiful and close to the beach which was awesome.  it was very clean and had everything i needed.  hope we get to meet next time.  very nice neighborhood too.  we felt very safejanaf was an amazing host! she always cleaned the restroom while i was out exploring so when i came back i didn\\'t have to worry about any mess. i also loved the neighborhood! many restaurants within walkable distance! i definitely recommend stay here and would come back next time i\\'m in san francisco. i had an enjoyable stay at janaf’s home. she went out of her way to make me feel welcome and was very hospitable. she even went out and got me medicine when i was ill. i found that the heating worked perfectly well. i would definitely stay with janaf again.i never met janaf because i got into san fran extremely late (2am) and left really early (7am) but she cares so much about her guests she actually called me around 8 asking where i was because she so badly wanted to meet me and send me out with some fruit. she had been awake the whole time but didnt want to come out in order not to disturb us since we came in so late. her house is adorable, the room comfy and cozy and most importantly extremely clean. i highly recommend this place to anyone. she even let us park at her house the whole day which was so helpful considering parking is hard to find and expensive. thank you, janaf! until next time, insha\\'allah!janaf was a great host who did everything she can to make our stay as pleasant as possible. the apartment was clean and tidy with easy access to facilities.sunset district is really peaceful and janaf\\'s place is so easy to find. janaf is very hospitable and warm-hearted. feel like home. janaf was the best host, she prepares everything for you. her place is very convenient and comfortable, walking distance to restaurants, safeway and public transportation. i stayed busy in san fran so i really only slept and showered at janaf\\'s home. i really enjoyed doing that there though. plenty of room to sleep and a tidy bathroom and shower to get cleaned up in. janaf was very nice in trying to help you have a enjoyable experience. i enjoyed calling this place home for the night. a nice backyard to look out to. also the included parking spot made my car use super easy. a nice plus in san fran if you are driving. it\\'s a very scenic area of town. janaf was very personable and friendly. the description was accurate and it is in a safe area.host was extremely attentive, gracious and flexible. very quiet. great having parking!the host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we stayed with janaf for 15 days and liked living in her house. janaf is very polite and caring. she helped us to stay in san francisco, explained the surrounding areas. the house is clean and you have private bathroom, can cook if needed. you can walk to the the pacific ocean and golden gate. we enjoyed staying with janaf.this was our first experience with airbnb. after looking at the hotel prices in san francisco, $350 and up for a decent hotel not 100 miles from the city, i decided to join airbnb and give it a try.\\r\\nnow, if all airbnb are hosted like janaf hosted us, then airbnb will be my first choice everywhere i travel from now on.\\r\\njanaf was the perfect host, she was so welcoming. she let us have the run of the whole house, in fact we felt like we were the only ones in the house, when she was home janaf stayed in her own room, but when we were able to talk to her she was so nice, offering us anything in her fridge and full use of the kitchen if you wanted to cook a full breakfast. however i didn\\'t like to take advantage of her generosity so we bought our own supplies, milk, bread etc from the safeway just a short walk away.\\r\\nthe room is a bit small but very comfortable, and has its own ensuite bathroom. shampoo and soap are provided. we traveled fairly light with small cases, but if you travel with full size cases it might be difficult finding somewhere to put them and not be tripping over them.\\r\\nwifi is provided and worked very well on smart phones.\\r\\nyou can uber from janaf\\'s place to fishermans wharf using uber pool for less than $10. uber x is about $20.\\r\\nwould we stay with janaf again. absolutely!!!! janaf was a very hospitable host. she gave us a great deal of privacy – we practically at the house to ourselves. we also had a private bathroom which was great. house is located in a nice neighborhood in parking is very easy. getting intosan francisco was easy because there\\'s lots of routes through the sunset, richmond or other directions to visit more densely populated areas of thecity. a great experience and  i would recommend staying with janaf.i stayed here for a month. the stay was absolutely amazing.\\r\\nthe place if big, and quite. janaf makes you feel quite and home and have all the place for you. \\r\\nshe was kind enough to allow me to do some light cooking, during the extended stay.\\r\\nthere\\'s food if you forgot to get some.\\r\\nmuni travel is easiest, with bus #7 and caltrain.\\r\\nthis is a really safe neighbourhood, in an otherwise unsure city.\\r\\nbest of all, janaf tries to keep the place really clean. she would clean weekly, and/or when needed.\\r\\nshe is extremely nice and a warm hearted person. she might end up spoiling you feeding with chocolates, and fruits, and fresh salad sandwiches!\\r\\n\\r\\ni would have loved to stay here for another month, but alas, she\\'s always booked!\\r\\n\\r\\nthis will definitely be my first preference if i am to be back here.janaf is an extremely friendly host! she was kind, accommodating and caring.\\n\\nthe room is as depicted in the pictures. cosy and clean! location is great as well, a short bus ride to town!janaf was the best host!! she was so kind and made our stay really comfortable! accomodations were great. i highly recommend this place. very safe neighborhood with lots of parking spaces.this was my first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. janaf was a gracious host. she made my husband and me feel right at home. her place was clean and quiet. the bus stop is very close and so convenient. highly recommend her place and would definitely stay here again!shannon\\'s place is indeed stunning and he himself is a perfect host. his house is located in a cute little street in the mission, a very cool neighborhood. access to his place was easy and the room is spacious  with a comfy bed, books and water - the extra was that he had even set up a bottle of wine, snacks and fresh flowers. we spent an evening together talking about work and life, and i must say it could not have been a more pleasant time. \\non thing to note is that the victorian house is not soundproof and nightly noise from the outside and the neighbors are common. i still managed to sleep like a rock, but if you are sensitive, bring earplugs. \\nthanks again, shannon - you are a 5 star hist and i hope we will stay in touch. from hussain: shannon was a kind and generous host and we shared many a good conversation. he resides in the building which i appreciated a great deal. the house is very well-kept, beautiful, and modern and is conveniently located between market and mission districts where there are tons of great coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance.being still fairly new to the bay area and san francisco, i took the opportunity to stay in the city, but particularly in a neighborhood where i can feel and become a local. staying the evening with shannon was the exact experience i was looking for! his amazing hospitality was very sincere, warm and welcoming. shannon took the time to get me familiar with the castro neighborhood, accompanying at dinner and for a night cap (or two) at some local watering holes.\\n\\nhis house is warm and inviting, with all the accommodations expected at a hotel, but with the comfort of home. \\n\\ntruly a great experience! i cannot wait to stay again and recommend to my friends and family visiting the city.when i first arrived, shannon was running out the door, but in entering my room, clean towels, snacks and drinks were waiting for me. shannon was very sweet in texting me upon my arrival to make sure i found everything easily and to see if i needed anything else. i felt comfortable and at ease right away. \\r\\n\\r\\nsince i was in town for business, we didn\\'t have much time to hang out, but one morning shannon made me breakfast and coffee which was the perfect start to my day.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was even better than the airbnb listing. seriously! the whole apartment is beyond clean and tidy, which is a necessity for me. the shared spaces are spacious and brightly lit. \\r\\n\\r\\nif i could envision my dream home, this would probably be it.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould i stay here again? absolutely. should you? absolutely.\\r\\nthank you shannon for a great stay. your home is beautiful, clean, quiet and in an awesome location. thanks for  answering all my questions, the welcome gifts and the great recommendations. you embody the art & heart of hospitality. look forward to staying with you again next time i head to sf.michael was really nice and super helpful with letting us

she had thought of everything and even made sure that we were stocked up for breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nher house is very homely and we were comfortable for the duration of our stay, everything was as described in the airbnb listing or better. the neighborhood was fantastic, lots of tiny boutique stores and restaurants to discover and tina made sure we knew where to start discovering with all the useful tips and suggestions. \\r\\n\\r\\ntina knows here neighborhood and city very well so as well as being a great host she was also able to act as a source of knowledge about places to go in sf. on top of this, she makes a very good pinot noir :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks tina for making our stay in sf an exceptional one.\\r\\n\\r\\ndanielmy husband and i rented tina\\'s house for a family get together the week after christmas.  the six of us (my son and his wife and our two granddaughters) were well accommodated in this large, comfortable flat that had everything we could want and more. the neighborhood is fantastic, quiet but within easy walking distance of fillmore street and everything on offer there. the girls enjoyed playing in the park, also an easy walk away--that is when we could get them to leave their glorious sunny bedroom!  tina is a lovely person, a great communicator and wonderful host who went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and happy, even down to providing hypoallergenic bedding for my granddaughter and two bottles of her delicious homemade wine for us.  tina is an expert winemaker and we regret not arranging to have a wine tasting or tour with her, which we will certainly arrange when we return to sf. hopefully her flat will be available too, as we would definitely stay there again.  many thanks tina for helping make our family holiday special!we rented this house for our employees.  tina (the owner) is wonderful! she always responded me quickly! the house was clean and well equipped.  it is just a few blocks from a local super

the actual apartment. \\r\\ni would definitely stay here again, we had a great time.diana was very nice and accomodating! she was there to greet me when i arrived and showed me the ropes. the house is very nice with plenty of space, nice kitchen, bathrooms, etc. the beds were also very comfy! all around great experience. i would definitely recommend i enjoyed my stay with ronaldo the room was basically a bed in a closet but it was very comfortable and had plenty of room.  it\\'s out off of great highway right next to the ocean, and there are plenty of areas to park.  ronaldo was a nice host he met me at the building to give me the keys and provide a walk thru.perfect location with a parking for a very good price if you like to walk along the shore. just a minute away from the ocean. ronaldo is a great host and always ready to help and share useful information about the city. had an excellent conversation with him. ronaldo was very accommodating - a great place to crash for a few

fab.the appartment is small and simple, but very friendly, i didn\\'t miss anything. ronaldo the host is very good, he is very respectful and welcoming. he knows good spots to see and is open minded and easy going. i spend a whole month there and would go there again, so, a big recommodation.this was my first time using air b&b, and i have to say i was extremely pleased with my decision to do so.  ronaldo and his cat indie were very gracious and accommodating, and the apartment was very clean, cozy, and comfortable.  the price is better than right at a mere $50 a night; combined with the close access to the muni, the beach, the zoo, and delicious local eateries.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere is literally no better place to stay if you need to rent a room in san francisco, and i would be more than happy to stay with ronaldo and indie again!thank you so much for your help ronaldo. i really enjoyed my stay at your house. you were very kind and i wish you good luck.good choice if you sre on a budget.

fantastic. ronaldo was very nice and accommodating. ill definitely be staying there again in the future.nice small bed to stay for a couple of nights. it is located right on the ocean shore but a bit outside of the city center (although public transport is just a block away). nice host and good communication. great place with a good location. very cozy but ronaldo was mostly gone so it was like having the place to yourself great location for a run around the neighborhood and it\\'s near some coffee/breakfast joints. the breeze and smell of the ocean is constant. street parking wasn\\'t an

san francisco!very small, cozy space literally right next to the ocean. ronaldo was a kind and welcoming host.couldn\\'t have asked for a better host than ronaldo! on the day i was supposed to arrive,

necessities, but everything you need if you plan to do a lot of wondering around the city / beach and just plan to crash here. the view was breath taking, easily the best part. thanks, ronaldo!

my boyfriend and i were going to a festival at golden gate park and we were close enough to ride our bicycles, which was great! keith was very accommodating and pleasant; the house was clean and was exactly what was shown in the photos. we were able to have coffee every morning and drink it out at a table on the deck which has a very nice view of the city. all in all, it was a nice place to stay.\\r\\nvery nice place, amazing view and great host.keith went out of his way to make us feel at home.  the room was clean with fresh sheets and towels, the bed was very comfortable, we had free access to the kitchen (with complimentary tea, coffee, and cereal), and lots of kind perks to make our stay more pleasant, such as guest passes to some local attractions.  the location is terrific-- a steep hill to climb, but the view is well worth it!  \\r\\n\\r\\nkeith was sociable when we wanted to be, inviting us to join him and other guests for evening wine and conversation.  when we were tired from exploring san francisco all day, he gave us privacy to just relax in our room. i had the pleasure of staying with keith for 5 nights.  his home near buena vista park was in a quiet neighbourhood, and easy walking distance to the castro and haight districts.  the place was tidy and well-stocked, and it was a pleasure spending my mornings looking out to a sweeping view of sf from his deck.  keith himself, though, was the highlight of my stay.  i found him friendly, highly intelligent, and easy to talk with - he clearly enjoys hosting, and is a natural at it.  he was very helpful, and offered a wealth of tips for exploring the sf bay area.  a friend of mine stayed with me - this was her first airbnb, and after two days she felt like a roommate.  i hope to stay again the next time i\\'m in sf!it was nice stay in keith\\'s house. it was very comfortable and keith is very nice and helping.my stay was great! keith was happy to tell me all about the city, share breakfast food, snacks and stories, and the room and apartment were nice and clean. i felt very welcome, and like i could hang out as much or as little as i wanted!keith was the consummate host! we had 4 teenage boys and 1 teacher with our group, and keith provided an endless supply of chocolate for everyone. the boys loved the view, wonderful supply of toiletries, super soft toilet paper, and time talking with keith. the location was conveniently located to public transportation which was great. keith is a terrific host who made me feel welcome before my feet hit the front door mat.  he always made me feel welcome and included.  one evening, for example, my adult sons and i returned to the apartment and found keith hosting a friend\\'s birthday. he invited us to join the party and have some tacos and wine and conversation, which we gladly accepted and enjoyed.keith was an awesome host. i was here for work for the night. he had just deep cleaned the carpets and had a very clean room for me. he welcomed me to join him and his friend for a drink and snacks when i got there and was extremely helpful in suggestions for local spots to go. he had all the ameninities that were needed and had the biggest selection of tea/coffee for his guests. we got to chat a little and i would highly suggest his place if you\\'re looking for a great place to stay, good location, and good host/people to be around.  thank you keith!  amazing spot in san francisco! it was like moving there for 3 days and be a happy local, already knowing the good directions.\\nkeith prepared the best guide to the house and the city i ever seen, just follow directions and enjoy the beautiful city!he is the best!!we have an urgent extra 4days and keith is very considerate. thank u keith.keith was a great host and his place was the perfect spot for me to stay. it was comfy, convenient, had a great view from his balcony, he had cereal and tea and coffee and various milks... \\r\\n\\r\\nalso he gave the ultimate guide to everything local, very cool! from places to eat to museams to visit. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would stay there again! \\r\\n\\r\\nniko keith is a great host. i was trying to book the place quite late around midnight and keith was very prompt in replying to my queries. he stayed up late for me till the time i reached his place which i appreciate a lot. keith also has a detailed guide ready for his guests to explore the city which helps a lot. i couldn\\'t spend much time with keith as i had to leave quite early in the morning but i am gonna stay at his place again whenever i visit sf next.\\r\\nthe room was comfy and was as described in the listing. the balcony gives an awesome view of the city and i was lucky to get a glimpse of the sunrise as i was leaving early in the morning. highly recommended!!keith\\'s place was great! it had everything we needed and more. he was very accommodating to us especially because we had a last minute booking inquiry and his replies are very quick. the house was very clean and well organized with an awesome view of the city. he is a really great host with a thorough knowledge of the city. his place is definitely a gem and i\\'d recommend it to any one who is looking for a cozy and beautiful neighborhood in san francisco!keith was a really nice, helpful host, he offered us some a drink when we arrived and cereals/coffee for breakfast, we felt at home. his house is beautiful, like in the pictures, the bed was really confortable! we had a rental car and fortunately we found parking (free) on the street, along the park , which is very close to the house. really nice house to stay. great located in a perfect neighborhood. amazing view from the balcony. keith was a really nice host. i do recommend this place!everything worked great, keith provided me with a code to enter the apartment. beautiful view from the balcony!keith was great. really great information was provided prior to my arrival, and he was super  friendly about everything. had cereal and coffee there for the morning, clean/large room, and the best view of san francisco i\\'ve ever had. really hope i have the opportunity to return!it was very nice staying at keith\\'s hause. the place is ideally situated, very pleasant. keith is a very friendly host. i really appreciated that keith provides a choice of cereals and coffee for breakfast. i unfortunately stayed only two nights at his place, but would definitely consider coming back for a next stay in san francisco.keith is a great host and i highly recommend his place. he literally provides everything you could need from bathroom amenities to breakfast. also, the view from his balcony is amazing. keith is also happy to spend time talking to his guests.unfortunately we were unable to meet keith, but wow - his place really is a pro air bnb. awesome technology, most comfortable bed and an incredible neighbourhood.\\nkeith was very responsive, helpful and so wonderful through email. i\\'d visit again in a heartbeat.leading up to my trip to sf i was in good touch with kaz.  he was very responsive both in confirming my booking (by morning time after i let him know i wanted to rent the room the night before).  so didn\\'t bother booking something else and kaz came through.  once in sf again kaz was easy to get a hold of and to make arrangements.  the place was great.  it is a very nice location with coffee shops and restaurants all around.  the master bedroom suite you get to stay in was great, the bed very comfortable, nice linens, towel, toiletries, etc., and the master bathroom was first class with separate shower and jacuzzi tub.  kaz had wifi for guests to use.  compared to a hotel i give this 10 out of 10 stars and exactly what the airbnb experience was meant to be.  thanks kaz!ali was extremely accommodating and responsive. the room was well-organized, well-decorated (the photos don\\'t do it sufficient justice), and private. the location is also as prime as it gets. would certainly recommend to anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\non a side note: the shower wasn\\'t as warm as i am accustomed to.everything went perfect. we will recommend this place to others, thanks kaz!this was perfect. the location gave me many options for food and activity. i had plenty of privacy with my own entrance and a deck to enjoy my coffee. the bathroom was my favorite! huge tub great shower and a bidet. the roommates were all very nice. i was not around much so my interaction was little but kaz was only a phone call away. thanks again.   i stayed at kaz\\'s place for 5 nights. it was clean with plenty of space and an awesome shower. it has a great location especially because i was visiting my sister and her family that live just a couple blocks away, but i loved that you could just walk out the door and be right there on polk, where you could go to any number of coffee shops for breakfast no more than one or two blocks away. aside from the occasionally loud upstairs neighbor, it was a very comfortable place to stay. i loved that the room had its own private entrance. i would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking. had a beautiful time in sf thanks to the hospitality of julie! the house is gorgeous and all new. the room has a comfy bed and nice bathroom to match. also a great patio to sit down and relax after a long day. the host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this beautiful, comfortable and quasi private second-floor worked great as a crash pad for me as i was rushing around sf and sillicon valley the three days i was there.  julie was a lovely host. she was incredibly helpful and flexible with my tight schedule. she even lent me tooth paste when i needed it! i will try to stay here again on my upcoming trips to the area. highly recommend!it was truly wonderful to stay at julie\\'s apartment. the loft is beautiful, airy, modern and super clean. the room has its private floor with balcony and private bathroom. the bed is super comfortable as well!  julie was a wonderful wonderful host. so welcoming, friendly and super easy going. more like staying with friends than an airbnb host. ! communications on email were also great. super helpful and responsive. there are some funky cafes and bars around the apartment area and a great supermarket too. i will definitely be staying with julie the next time i am in san francisco! i had a nice stay there. the apartment is clean and beautiful, and i own an entire floor as described in the listings. i went to sf for an interview and it was nice of them to help me out for preparation:) recommend!wonderful! julie and francois were super super nice and very helpful welcoming hosts, providing great recommendations for restaurants, parking etc. i enjoyed my stay in their beautiful loft, it\\'s airy, light, clean. and the patio is awesome. the soma district was a nice convenient location to explore the cityfrancois is a modest person and a great host. although i didn\\'t get a chance to meet julie, they both made sure i feel comfortable during my 1 week stay with their prompt replies to my queries.\\r\\nthe loft is indeed beautiful, super clean, and felt like it\\'s one of those fancy place which comes in interior design magazines! the patio gives lots of sunlight, fresh air and a good view of the neighborhood. the living room is spacious and if you have some free time, you could enjoy watching netflix or chromecasting on the tv.\\r\\nas someone still exploring the city, the neighborhood is also convenient with enough places to eat, hangout, and 10-12 mins uber ride to the union square.super host and very accommodating a unique place to be spending good time in san francisco! beautifully designed and ideally located in the heart of soma, the apartment is even more comfortable than it looks with its high ceilings and 3 independent floors. the private bedroom with its own patio is huge with a queen-size bed and full independent bathroom. and the hosts are wonderful: welcoming and very friendly, they make your stay like being at home with a french touch of class and warmth. my best stay in san francisco in 30 years of traveling to the us. for both work and leisure. thank you !i don\\'t have enough good things to say about julie, francois and their amazing place. this listing is top notch - beautifully designed, comfy, spacious, and in a convenient location. the room, bathroom and private balcony/porch are just what you\\'d want. julie & francois made me feel like i was staying with friends in the city and really helped make my (2nd ever) experience in sf incredible and local - they\\'re exactly what airbnb hosts should be! they were both so welcoming, friendly and down to earth. so glad i stayed here. i will definitely be recommending it to friends and looking julie & francois up next time i\\'m in town. thank you guys!great residence and hosts. enjoyed my stay in the very spacious loft apartment, lots of private space for myself and a great community room to share with the wonderful hosts.julie was very accommodating.  our original air b&b canceled last minute and she graciously took us in.  her apartment was very clean and in a great location.julie was an awesome host - her place is an amazing space.  description is totally accurate - you will have an entire floor, with balcony and private bath and super easy to communicate with julie.  i was super busy with work and came home exhausted every night, so i regret i did not have more time to converse with my hosts, but i also appreciated the fact they gave me enough space to relax after a long day.  highly recommend!!!julie is an amazing host. the check in process was completely easy and she was so accommodating when i got in much later than expected. the apartment is absolutely beautiful and is very quiet. the room and the private bathroom were perfect for my stay and i could not have been happier. i would recommend for anyone to stay here and look forward to hopefully staying here on my next trip back to sf!i booked for a friend and this is what he said: \\r\\n\\r\\n\"nice little spot walking distance to main arteries of the city, responsive host, great amenities. the only thing to be very cautious with is the parking situation - got a ticket because the home is on a hill and i failed to turn the wheels to the curb. but overall great experience.\"our stay was fine but we did have some challenges. the location and neighborhood are great. the house is nice and the space is adequate. the unit felt tidy but needs a deep clean. the listing warns that the floors are thin and noise travels, but we were surprised how much we could hear from the hosts upstairs - each footstep and conversation. the biggest problem was that i had a lot of difficulty communicating with my hosts prior to check in. the day of check in, i tried contacting the hosts several times via texting, calling, and the app, but there was no response until a couple hours prior to check in, which cause my group some stress. i understand that it was the same day as a big marathon in san francisco, but smoother, quicker communication would have helped. i had to contact the host again to ask for the wifi password which was not listed anywhere. it would help if there was a welcome packet inside the unit.excellent location. nice linens.  owners responded to plumbing problem promptly. a bit noisier from floor above than we anticipated. didn\\'t get info on access until an hour before check in, despite several inquiries. jeff was great! he met us when we moved in and showed us around. the apartment is in a really cool location and had everything we needed for our 2 nights here.i had a really good time at carlos\\' place on my trip to san francisco!  he is a caring and very polite and friendly host. the room was wonderful and the bed was just awesome! \\nhe has good knowledge of the surrounding area and can give good tips for a trip to the city! \\nwould definitely recommend :)we stayed at carlos place for three nights and it was just perfect! cosy, calm, relaxing! carlos is the best host you can find - welcoming and helpful beyond words. we want to come back soon - also to meet the lovely dog, ms coco!!belinda house is not a house, is home.\\r\\n\\r\\ni went there with my friends and spent 7 amazing days last week. \\r\\ni immediately felt that place was special and full of energy.\\r\\n\\r\\neverything you can find here, you can\\'t find in hotels or other places.\\r\\n\\r\\nevery time i\\'ll go back to sf i\\'ll go back to belinda. \\r\\ni\\'m so glad i found this place in airbnb, because i had an incredible life experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you from all of my heart\\r\\n\\r\\nlove \\r\\n\\r\\nreevesme and my 3 friends have stayed at belinda\\'s place for a week in october 2013. we totally loved the apartment! it is located in very quiet and nice area of san francisco. we found it very welcoming and friendly. place was really clean (what we totally appreciate). belinda was really helpful and kind. if you\\'re looking for a cozy apartment, where you can feel like home, contact belinda! very beautiful and clean. place... everything in the place was exactly like the pictures that were shown .. if i come back i would definitely rent the same place i really enjoyed my stay with belinda. the place was clean and comfortable and she was nice. this property was very clean and quite spacious for the city.  we chose this location because its just down the street from our good friends, but otherwise it may not be ideal for tourist visiting the city.  was nice to be one block from the new whole foods.  the caretaker for the property (forgetting his name) was very pleasant and attentive.  our one issue was wanting to change the length of our stay by one day.  we got stonewalled completely, and really without any conversation.  the owner was very quick to reply to our original reservation, but took several days to get back to us about the date change- and really never did because she had the caretaker just tell us no.  rules are rules, thats fine, but felt disrespectful to not at least have a conversation.  for this i would not recommend this property, or rather- do so with some caution.  additional complaints are minor, but include things like lack of silverware (1 knife), no guide for the satellite tv which was mostly asian language channels, a bizarre number of unlabeled light switches which the caretaker didn\\'t even know how to operate, and the backyard chickens that woke us up in the morning.  for the price i expected better.the reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.belinda & robin were great. belinda (the owner) met me at the door, helped me with my bags, and showed me around the apartment. robin (property manager) was fantastic in talking/texting me through some issues i had at the airport. the apartment was clean and appeared as advertised. the apartment is very nice and clean, 2br/2ba is exactly what we need! parking space is hard to find, but you can pay extra money to use the host\\'s garage.the apt was lovely, spacious and clean. belinda was helpful as i was making last minute plans. robin gave us some great tips for travel and directions. the listing was accurate and the location had all the amenities described.it is a great house and we enjoyed the days what we live therei and my friends spend a week at belinda\\'s home. it was a nice place and we enjoyed stay at. also, the neighborhood is safe. belinda was helpful and kind with us. thanks belinda for everything that you did. if i come again to san francisco, i will rent your home.\\r\\ni highly recommend this place to stay at.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks belinda,everything is perfect in this beautiful house,this gona be my first choice in sf.mark\\'s home is in a wonderful neighborhood just a few blocks away from anything you could possibly want.  i loved going on a morning run  in the area and exploring the different bordering areas of noe valley and mission. this was a business meets pleasure trip for me and the home worked perfectly for both. the wireless worked well in the house and i enjoyed working in the back yard and around the cozy living room or dining area very much. it was incredibly quiet and private in the backyard and although we didn\\'t end up using the hot tub, we checked it out and it looked clean and well kept. the kitchen had everything i needed and more and i was even greeted by a wonderful bottle of read wine. i understand that this was one of the first times mark rented his home and while i was missing a hair dryer and some extra towels - adam, who manages the property for mark was trying his best to organize the missing items as fast as possible. overall, i had a fantastic time in san francisco and definitely fell in love with this neighborhood, which i can fully attribute to my stay at mark\\'s lovely home. everything as billed; clean and comfortable.  able to contact the host for a couple questions upon arrival.  exactly as i\\'d hoped.we had an amazing time staying at mark\\'s home. as great as the place looks in the pictures, it was even better in person.  super clean, fully stocked with every amenity you need.  very spacious house in a quiet neighborhood, which was walking distance from some great bars and cafes. checking in and out was super easy.  mark has done a great job decorating the place with very cool art and furniture.  will definitely look into staying here again!beautiful home, simple and spacious. they were very helpful with questions i had. lucky they had a spare travel baby crib for our 1 year old son to sleep in, which was very convenient. everything in the house is self-explanatory and easy to use. it was not cheap, but for the right reasons as it was a well cared home and the area was fantastic. definitely recommend it.  mark\\'s home was an amazing little getaway. it was in a great neighborhood that was quiet and safe. we had no trouble finding parking on the weekend either. the house itself was well kept and clean with great sf charm. i would definitely recommend this place! very nice place in a great part of city.  will look to stay againthe home is exactly as pictured and described - it defines the airbnb experience.  everything went along seamlessly from checking-in and getting settled.  we were welcomed with wine and chocolate treats.  everything you could possibly need is available so it really feels like your home away from home.   we were able to prepare breakfast every morning while taking advantage of the local eateries for lunch and dinner.  my kids and parents were able to go to dolores park everyday while i was able to easily access public transport to get to meetings.  the flat is very spacious and only a few blocks to the mission and a few blocks to noe valley (wholefoods and cvs).  my husband and i were able to sneak out for drinks and ice-cream.  he also used the hot tub.  i really wish we could have stayed longer - my kids were sad to leave.  the cleaners do a great job and you can tell they care about doing it well.  this is the place i would recommend to anyone who wants to have the local san francisco experience.  thank you for welcoming us to your home! my family and i agree: if we were to come back to san francisco we would rent this apartment again. we felt at home immediately. the apartment is spacious and tastefully furnished; the privacy factor is huge - quiet neighborhood, private back patio with working hot-tub! the beds very comfortable (well, except for the pull-out sofa which worked fine for my 12 year old son, but i certainly would not want to sleep on it). a well stocked kitchen - they even leave a welcome bottle of wine & chocolate. we did have some trouble with the tv the first night, but all was taken care of the very next day. in fact, adam - the manager - fulfilled all of our requests (and we had a few, like extra towels and a hair dryer) in a timely fashion. i definitely recommend this apartment. it isn\\'t quite in the center of city life, but really only a few blocks from several restaurants etc. one block from corner store & laundry. parking was easy for us, but that\\'s because my husband has a handicap parking permit. otherwise during the week it\\'s 2 hour time limit between 8 & 6. no limit on the weekends or evenings and i saw plenty of spaces if you can handle the two hour shuffle game. but public transportation is fairly easy in this city and the apartment is only a couple blocks from bus stop. it\\'s also walking distance to the mission district with amazing restaurants and painted murals decorating the buildings nearby. the neighborhood is completely safe. the apartment, like most older san francisco apartments has a few quirks: two of the bedrooms are at the front of the house and the bathroom they share is at the other end. the wooden floors squeak when you walk, but thankfully there isn\\'t anyone living above you! i never could figure out how to adjust the heating system to our timing and preferences. other than those few quirks, our stay at this modern victorian home in noe valley could not have been better. my family had a wonderful vacation in san francisco, and this apartment was a big part of it. my colleagues & and i loved staying at mark\\'s incredible home! everything was exactly as pictured and it was the perfect place to stay for a quick three days in the city. mark left us some lovely chocolates and bottle of wine and the house was clean and with everything you could possibly need. highly recommend - great location, comfy beds, clean bathroom and full kitchen, even comes with a hot tub, which we sadly did not have a chance to enjoy. thank you mark!mark\\'s place was exactly as described.  it\\'s in a great neighborhood, and the house was not only designed in a very inviting way, it also fit me and 3 others comfortably.  also, great instructions - extremely clear, and this made it all even more convenient after a few long work days.  i\\'ll definitely be circling back here if i have the opportunity in the future.clean, spacious, beautiful house in wonderful location.  close to excellent restaurants and shopping. we really enjoyed every day we spent here and can\\'t wait to come back. thanks  adam for your  patience answering all my questions.  we all enjoyed your books. i had a little get together with some friends and family for my birthday night and this space was fantastic! we were all so aesthetically pleased by the interior design and impressed by the ease of using the hot tub. there\\'s a bathroom next to the dining room so you don\\'t drip too much once you\\'re inside from the tub. san francisco is usually relatively too cold to hop into a hot tub but it was really nice to know that the tub was kept hot when we got there. i\\'m also thoroughly impressed by the collection of books in each room. didn\\'t get to meet mark but he and his brother, adam, who coordinates for the space were helpful by keeping in touch and answering any questions i had while i was planning everything last minute. definitely felt welcome by them and the listing was accurate, and i’m entirely appreciative of their help. it was also really sweet they included a bottle of red wine and chocolate. neighborhood is very quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of the city which isn’t too far away either. definitely glad i chose here to stay to host a nice get-together. :)our best airbnb experience to date! a truly beautiful home located walking distance to so many great sf areas, but the neighborhood still feels very quiet (even on new year\\'s eve!) it was perfect for our family of 6 exploring the city for a few days (the youngest couple took the pull-out - no complaints). comfy beds, clean, and fun decor. thanks to adam for being so responsive. the hot tub was a bonus, as was the bottle of wine! cheers.this was a quiet and warm home at a convenient location (j train is a block away and will bring you downtown in 15 min). adam and mark were both very helpful. i definitely would go back again if i need such a large space (we were six and it worked out very well)the house was as described. very clean and roomy and in a wonderful neighborhood close to valencia and 24th st. for restaurants and shopping and the muni.\\r\\nthe hosts were available quickly and very friendly.\\r\\ngreat stay, can\\'t wait to go back.what a treat to stay in a painted lady in san francisco!  mark\\'s home certainly lived up to the enticing photos -- everything was beautiful, comfortable and very clean.  the neighborhood was quiet and safe; it was a great place to walk around, and very convenient to the events we were attending in the mission district.  mark\\'s brother, adam, handled all the booking details and everything went smoothly.  this was my first airbnb experience and it was a great introduction!mark\\'s place is fantastic, very nice amenities, everything is top quality. the location is outstanding. it\\'s two blocks away from muni, so super convenient to downtown. the building is charming, you cannot make it any more san francisco than this historical victorian. the neighborhood is super quiet, but you are walking distance from noe valley and the mission. excellent value, excellent location, excellent place. such an amazing experience. the home was beautiful, check in was super easy. beds are super comfortable and have fantastic linens and pillows. they left a cute little booklet with all the information you need on using the home facilities and the surrounding area. hot tub was clean and such an amazing way to end the evening!!!they left a bottle of wine that was nice.  the listing is beautiful and even more impressive in person. i loved all the art work and books throughout the place. even though i live in san francisco, i felt like i was on vacation at mark\\'s home and that i transcended into a different, fun life. fantastic apartment and location.  very easy and enjoyable experience.  clean home. great location. mark kept in touch and was great at accommodating our travel schedule. thanks for hosting us!the house was gorgeous, great lighting, lots of space and very clean.  it was a great space to spend time with friends, very close to public transportation and in a wonderful area for good food.  this area is usually has the best weather in all of sf too. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was easy to book, and check-in and out.  seamless.  i would recommend this house to friends and family. we felt very welcome with a well equipped kitchen, comfy living space and beds. everything is as described. it is in a lovely and quiet neighborhood.\\r\\nmark was very helpful and prompt with our questions and concerns. thanks mark! superb apartment in a great location. we couldn\\'t have been happier with this. what a lovely home! very close to carmel downtown with lots of great restaurants around. babette was a great host, by leaving lots of great information about carmel, and she was very helpful when we had trouble opening the lockbox. the house was amazing. it was very clean, and decoration was very cute! my friend and i absolutely loved this place, and if we ever come back to carmel, this will be the place to stay!!great place in a great location. spacious and comfortable, with all the amenities.  mark was great- responsive and invested in our experience. would highly recommend.mark was really easy to get in touch with before and during our stay and really accommodating of our minor days-of-stay change. his home is gorgeous, and was perfect for us on our trip in town. i\\'d happily stay there again, and again, and again! great place! as good as advertised and the j\\'s were a great host family. definitely recommended. also, if you don\\'t know sf well, the location is great for access to the mission, and you\\'re close to the 24th st. subway (bart). beautiful house with tasteful inner decorated   bedrooms, sitting room, and well-equipped  kitchen. that small backyard with a lovely spa  basin is most impressing. and above all, i like the wonderful books on differently designed bookshelves in every rooms. the green bamboos and other colored meaty plants in yard and along the stairs are also good for looking. we are from beijing. we love short time lodging experience in your house. regards/maymark and adam were excellent hosts. they were very responsive and we got access to the apartment easily.  the apartment was nicely decorated (loved the artwork) and very clean. the kitchen was well stocked and we used the barbecue, which made the apartment feel like home. the bed in the master bedroom was both huge and comfortable. i would definitely recommend staying at this apartment and i look forward to staying there again myself.the keys were readily available. we arrived late in the evening so we didn\\'t expect much contact with mark. but everything appeared as it should have. the house was welcoming and well lit. the rooms were all clean and very nice. my family all came in for my wedding and i arranged this house for them. in past visits we had to deal with the hassle of pets, multiple flights of stairs, condo neighbors, room mates etc... i wanted this visit to be calm and relaxing for my parents, sisters and kids. it was all that and more. i got the opportunity to hang out and chill with my family and that really is priceless. my parents loved reading on the back porch. the rooms were relaxing and large enough to host everyone. the kitchen was fully stocked and very clean and everyone enjoyed the hot tub. also, having dolores park within walking distance was great for the kids to play and for the grown ups to have a picnic and chill in the sun. parking was surprisingly easy seeing as how the neighborhood consists of a lot of families that are on the go. also, having a car isn\\'t necessary since the house is smack in the middle of the city and walking distance to castro, valencia & mission and market street etc... my family said that this was by far their best trip to sf to date. we will definitely be booking again :)  thanks mark!mark\\'s home is exactly as described.  he was very communicative before and during the stay, making the check-in and check-out process very easy.  it is located in a very good location with many restaurants, bars, and convenience stores within easy walking distance.  it is spacious and comfortable for several people traveling on business.  i would definitely stay there again and recommend it to other business travelers.i\\'m a chinese tourist. so happy with my stay here. this apartment offers everything i need and is even out of my expectations. parking is a problem but can be solved easily. we came there as a group of six and spent a wonderful night there. we cook and relax. thank you mark and your family. great place in noe valley.  the apartment was exactly as described and in a great location.  it was awesome to have a hot tub after exploring the streets (and hills) of san francisco. we would definitely go back!  as stated in the description you have to do street parking if you have a car, but you are not more than a $20 uber ride from most places in san francisco, and you are right on the muni line if you are going downtown (bart is also close too).  we rented a car for a weekend trip to muir woods, but summer parking is pretty easy as there is a school across the street from the apartment.  also as stated no laundry in the apartment, but best cleaners on 24th does same day wash and fold which is vastly superior to doing your own laundry.  the place is completely safe for kids and ours had a great time (ages 7 and 11) and do you do not need to bring reading material as the apartment is stacked (literally) with great selection.  thanks also to mark for leaving a kitchen stocked with essentials (beer).this home was perfect for our stay and laura made us feel extremely welcome. the natural light that floods the house was lovely to wake up to and the view is killer! we were just a short walk to, restaurants and shops. if you like to cook - the kitchen is extremely inviting. laura\\'s house is gorgeous and decorated with lots of taste and rationality. the kitchen is spacious and well equipped.\\neverything is made to let you feel at home.\\nwe have had a very nice stay and definitely recommend this place!so glad this was my first experience using airbnb because giovanna showed me what a wonderful host is like. her place is beautifully decorated with items from around the world, the place is clean and she\\'s extremely kind. i was amazed to see her take an extra step to ask if i needed anything and even gave me a quick walking tour of the neighborhood since i was unfamiliar with the area. i so appreciated the stay and would stay there again in a heartbeat if i ever was in the mission district again! thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s also very quiet, which is a plus for sleeping. staying with giovanna was my first experience with airbnb and from this experience i would most definitely book again.\\r\\n\\r\\ngiovanna was the perfect host. the accommodation was situated in a great location, the house is very accommodating and fun, relaxed environment and very flexible with check in and check out times.\\r\\n\\r\\ngiovanna supplied everything needed during my stay and went beyond her requirements offering her advice on the city and also events that she was aware of.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall an amazing experience.giovanna is one of the kindest person i have ever met. she has made my overall experience in san fran very pleasant, with flexible check in and check out, the house is really sweet and full of personnality, the room is very cosy, the patio is charming; and giovanna and her housemate gen are lovely lovely people, really easy going, friendly and kind. i will definitely come back! thank you so much for everything. xxxthe location was great for exploring the mission, within walking distance of the shops on valencia and the eateries on 16th street. giovanna was out of town, so i didn\\'t get to meet her, but she was readily contactable by email and phone, and her instructions were easy to follow. the place was warm and comfortable.first off, daniel\\'s place is downright beautiful--it is spacious, well-decorated, and has everything you could possibly need. moreover, it is located at a wonderful location, close to bart and the vibrant mission district, which has an amazing culture. however, what really shines is daniel and the thought he put into the accommodations. daniel is a fast responder and a very warm host. he left us his contact information as well as a friend\\'s so that if we needed anything, we could contact someone immediately at any time. he also left post-it notes at various places in his apartment detailing how to work his appliances (i.e. the stove light and fan) as well as where to find things (i.e. linen, towels, and extra drawer space). lastly, he left a map suggesting places we should visit, which was greatly appreciated! he really put a lot of thought in making our stay as convenient and enjoyable as possible. i have nothing but positive things to say about my stay at his apartment and would rent his place again in a heartbeat if i should ever find myself in san francisco again as well as recommend him to any of my friends coming to the city.our group have rented 4 apartments in san francisco at the same time and daniels one was the best of them. we\\'ve felt like home. apartment was clean, fully equipped, nice and comfy and 2 minutes away from tram/metro \"j\" that takes you directly to the downtown.\\r\\ndaniel was perfect host – always on phone ready to help with everything. we are going to stay there again in a few months. \\r\\nthanks daniel!we had a great time staying at daniel\\'s place.   it is a beautiful property and is immaculate inside.  the place is well equipped and the amenities are modern. i had a chance to meet daniel and he is super nice and worked us despite a difficult situation with our home.  could not have asked for a better experience!this is a great apartment, with easy access to downtown on the j line streetcar and dozens of good restaurants in a 5-10 walk. we recommend angkor borei and shiso. safeway is around the corner for grocery shopping. there are gorgeous views. it\\'s a great place to have friends come and hang out. our teenagers loved the feel of the place. you will not find a better neighborhood experience.daniels place is great. he accommodated us last minute and was immediate and very helpful with arrival details communication. my husband and i felt very welcome and there was enough communication to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. beautiful apartment with piano and curious musical finds and art from far-off lands. i would recommend this place for anyone interested in mission and valencia street hang outs of san francisco, two great neighbourhoods. j line is an easy ride into beautiful dolores park, (sensitive contents hidden) shuttle bus is on the corner of the apartment. great set up! thank you daniel for welcoming us like locals to our new home san francisco!  daniel was a wonderful host. he was out of town and we rented his entire apartment. he was organized (left us a guide, map, and even neighbour’s contact) and very prompt in answering all our questions pre and during our stay. his place was clean, well equipped, and very interesting! it was a great location for food, easy ride to downtown, and close to highway for day trips outside of san francisco. i enjoyed the sunny, open concept space and will definitely stay there again on my next trip to san francisco. thanks daniel!i needed to stay in sf for 4 days with a colleague for a business trip.  the apartment is 2 bedroom/2bath and was half the cost of a hotel.  it is large, spotless, and wonderfully decorated.  the neighborhood is fun and interested, far better than down town.  the garage parking spot was perfect and the washer/dryer came in handy.  highest possible recommendation. my sister\\'s family had a great stay at daniel\\'s place.  it in a good location convenient to supermarkets, taquerias and night-life.  the place itself was in really good condition, and daniel was very helpful with the check-in process and with any issues that came up.  as you can see from the picts, its also a nice place for to relax and play some piano or guitar! this is a clean, warm, and elegant house. so convenient for everything. safeway is just few steps from here. by cable car we can get everywhere. \\r\\ni also like daniel\\'s records collection very much. \\r\\nit\\'s really a home away from home. \\r\\nhope to come here again in my future trip here. great place! daniel was very accommodating. pictures are not deceiving whatsoever. definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a place to stay in the city.my girlfriend and i enjoyed our stay at daniels place a lot! his appartement is just wonderful! daniel gave us good information about town and recommended us some places we liked! we could even use his record turntable!\\r\\nwe also liked the convenient location just across the street from public transport and the convenient parking in the garage.\\r\\noverall a great experience and we would of course stay again at daniels place.daniel\\'s place is great.  it is spacious, clean, and conveniently located.  we were a group of 4 and felt the place was a good size for us.  we did not have a car and found it easy and affordable to get around all over the city with daniel\\'s place as our home base.  daniel was easy to get in touch with and a very hospitable host.  firstly, i thought daniel\\'s home was beautiful just from the pictures alone! but upon arrival, i have to say even the pictures did not do it justice! what a stunning home!! from the decor to each beautiful room and from the wonderful natural sunlight that emulated the spacious layout , i could not be any happier!!!  and to top it all off, not only was daniel so kind and generous to provide us with breakfast treats during our stay, but he took the time to give us great ideas to make our first visit to san francisco a very pleasurable one! \\r\\n\\r\\nlong story short, if i could give daniel 10 stars...i surely would!  thanks again daniel for helping to make our trip a fabulous one!!!dan\\'s place was perfect. the apartment has lot of character.  dan let us use the record player, which was awesome, and it  which really helped us unwind at the end of the day. about the place: the beds were extremely comfortable. the couch was comfortable than the bed. the kitchen was stocked with cereal, cereal bars, coffee and tea. the place also has hot tub and a grill. we did not get a chance to use either one. if you rent a car, the shared garage makes it easier compared to street parking. just get a compact car like ford fiesta.  during our stay, the coffee pot and the tea kettle kick started our day. we were there on a conference in downtown and was perfect for us. if i have to go back to sfo, will rent it again without any hesitation. if you decide tostay here, you need to also check out the melody cafe which is a block away from dan\\'s place and try their vegetable moussaka. the best moussaka! \\r\\n\\r\\nall the best to dan. dan was a wonderful host very accommodating to us when we arrived many hours earlier than planned.  a great space in a great area.  the place was exactly as advertised and very perfect for our san francisco locals experience. his vinyl collection is superb, the shower was a treat, and watching the trains go by at 2am (not noisy) complete with sparks was an added surprise. great communication throughout on daniels part as well. a fabulous time!daniel was a great host and his place is beautiful! the location was very convenient to many great restaurants. we appreciated being apply to play his guitar. he was also helping in communicating with us leading up to the trip. from start to finish, this was a wonderful experience. daniel\\'s home is as charming, bright and comfortable as it appears in these photos, and our host is as friendly and kind as you can deduce from all the glowing reviews. ;) there was ample room for the three of us and the location was extremely handy -- despite being on a busy street, we were never kept up at night by noise (the bedrooms are at the back of the apartment). having a lovely new washer/dryer and dishwasher was a fantastic bonus. daniel is a prompt and helpful communicator who was very generous with his time and the use of his home. highly recommended!\\r\\np.s. if you have the time, definitely explore bernal heights, especially the park -- the view is astonishing -- and have a coffee on the delightful patio of progressive grounds on cortland on your way back. interior:\\r\\ndaniel was a great host, and his home was exactly as described during our 4 night stay. it was very clean and organized, and it was great having somewhere to come back to and relax during our stay. we slept great on the two comfortable beds, and had a great breakfast in the morning in the open area kitchen. the two bathrooms were clean, and the master shower is very spacious. 10/10! note: it is a second floor unit, so anyone with knee problems may have a hard time getting up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\nlocation:\\r\\nit was exactly what we wanted with our stay in san francisco. downtown is easy to get to, car or public transit. one night we took the bus home, and it dropped us off within a block of daniel\\'s place. the other nights we drove, and the 101 was very easy to get on/off of. a bart station is also within walking distance. the airport is easy to drive to or take a cab/shuttle. a grocery store within walking distance saved us a lot of time too.\\r\\n\\r\\nparking:\\r\\nthe off-street parking for one small vehicle was great to have in a city like sf. my altima fit in with no room to spare, but it fit nonetheless!\\r\\n\\r\\ntv (for some of us this matters, for others they would prefer not having one):\\r\\nwe stayed during march madness, and my father loves his basketball. daniel has a smaller tv with an ota antenna, which we were able to watch some games on. he also provides an hdmi hookup, which my laptop plugged into easily. the couch/chair setup could definitely be improved though. it wasn\\'t comfortable to sit in for more than two people, and is not angled to watch the tv. this wasn\\'t something the listing claimed to have, so i\\'m not holding it against him. we made due and still got our late night entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nstay here to get out and see the city! we had an amazing time, and would recommend it to family, friends, and strangers.daniel was a fantastic host! he was very accommodating to our check in and check out time. his house was amazing, very clean and comfortable. the neighborhood is very safe and quiet for sf. he checked in on us via email to see if we needed anything and if we had any questions. defiantly check this place out when you are visiting sf.  \\r\\nabsolutely loved our stay at daniel\\'s! his place was clean, spacious (appreciated the two bedrooms/two bathrooms), had all of the amenities we needed and a few bonus ones (parking and washer/dryer). the safeway and walgreens were just around the corner as well as some great mexican restaurants and pizza places. daniel was super friendly and very easy to work with. i 100% recommend daniel\\'s if you\\'re looking for a great place to stay in san francisco! *if you\\'re renting a car, i highly recommend super cheap car rental too...the rates were 1/3 of other car rental places, we got a corolla with aux input (which made (sensitive contents hidden) maps/navigation really easy!) and the company was wonderful to deal with! \\nthank you very much daniel!!!!daniel was a wonderful host and met us when we arrived. his apartment had all mod cons and was just as described + great amenities like clothes washer/dryer/dishwasher and a full kitchen, important to us as we had a youngster in tow and often cooked at night. a car spot in the garage was also great as we did do a fair bit of driving on this trip. it\\'s not \\'centrally\\' located but sf public transport is literally outside the door and the local neighborhood has a great cafe\\', restaurants and a supermarket in walking distance so would definitely stay here again.daniel\\'s place was incredible!  super clean.  incredibly comfortable.  it was so bright and spacious.  just perfect for a fun week in the city.the apartment was spacious and reflective of the photos. located on busy road on the mission side. daniel was great to deal with. we\\'re on a four weeks trip trough california and were in daniels at the beginning and will be there at the end of our trip... we had a absolutly great time there. when you take the bus, your in the heart of san francisco in 15 minutes... daniel is a great host, we will love to come back to his place!daniel\\'s home was exactly as advertised. the space was beautiful and he was a helpful and generous host. \\r\\n\\r\\nhis home made a comfortable and easy homebase for our stay in san francisco. the bernal heights neighborhood was fun to explore with endless taquerias and bars. from daniel\\'s house, it was a quick hike to bernal hill with gorgeous views of the whole city. overall, it was an excellent stay!daniel\\'s apartment was great and easily accessible via metro and buses. loved the homely feel in his apartment. the picture you see in daniel\\'s web page is exactly the beautiful spacious and very good taste furnished apartment. one week of relaxing using the apt as a base to explore the city and the very interesting and charming mission area where the apt is located. thank uou daniel from all of us.the apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures.\\r\\nclean, spacious, comfortable.\\r\\ngood location.the apartment was clean and well furnished.  it is exactly what we were looking for and the description was accurate.  daniel was accommodating and accessible.  the garage was a pleasant surprise as were the laundry facilities.  we loved having a full kitchen and the outdoor grill.  it was 30-40 minutes to get downtown but we were very happy with the apartment and its value.daniel\\'s home is everything you can expected to be home away from home.  the beds were comfortable.  it has all the essential you need in the bathrooms and kitchen.  public transportation and restaurants and food market are within walking distant.  we prefer to drive so the space provided is perfect for us. the garage is small so make sure you rent a compact to midsize car.  daniel was a great host, he checked with us couple of times to make sure we have everything we need.  thanks! we felt very welcome in daniel\\'s lovely apartment.  ideal location with easy downtown access.  accurate description, in fact surpassed our expectations.  would recommend it to anyone. great place, great host!  lots of comfortable space, tastefully furnished.  great kitchen nicely stocked, and the washer and dryer came in handy.  sunny, and convenient to the mission district and bernal heights.  be sure to visit balmy and clarion alleys for street art in the former, and the heartfelt store for gifts in the latter.  it was nice to have a garage space available (though a lot of our travel was via uber and lyft).  daniel was always available quickly via text, though we never got a chance to meet in person - maybe next time!nice place, good location, easy process with daniel. we stayed in daniel\\'s apartment for a week while we attended a conference in downtown san francisco. the apartment is in a brilliant location, with easy bus and train links to downtown as well as all the major tourist locations. the living space was light and airy, with great-sized bedrooms and a fabulous central living space, and was equipped with everything we needed for our stay. off-street parking was a real bonus and will fit a large car by english standards (ford focus or similar). we didn\\'t get chance to meet daniel, but his communication by email was great and we felt very welcome the whole time we were there.we stayed in daniel\\'s apartment in san francisco for 3 nights and loved every minute. the apartment was clean, well stocked and comfortably furnished, great bathrooms and washing facilities inside which was particularly handy. the location is close to public transport which we found to be the best way to get around. would definitely stay here again.as always we had a great stay in san francisco. daniels apartment was spacious and well stocked. the location was excellent in terms of transport the muni, restaurants and shopping. thanks daniel for a very comfortable stay and the use of your lovely apartment. i would certainly recommend it to others as a place to stay in san francisco.my wife and i had a wonderful stay. daniel\\'s place was in a great location and very comfortable. he was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. i would definitely stay here again!we had a wonderful experience staying in daniel\\'s home.  during the entire process, daniel was very prompt in responding to our questions and requests. the home is in a good location for accessing just about anything  in san francisco.  the kitchen is well stocked. just about any amenity that you would require is available (cookware, coffee pot, hair dryer, iron, etc).   these are important because we\\'ve arrived at other airbnb homes that were missing these essential items.  the only minor quibbles we had were that the internet was nonexistent for a portion of our stay, and the other times when it was working it was very slow. if i were to propose any improvements, i would ask that the bedrooms have ceiling fans installed and have a tv in a at least one of them (we can\\'t sleep without tv).  as the home shares a garage with the neighbor, it might be tricky to squeeze in anything other than a midsize or smaller car.  however, we were made of that fact beforehand, so it wasn\\'t an issue.  overall, we enjoyed our stay in daniel\\'s home, and would use it again in the future without hesitation. highly recommended.daniel was really helpful! the communication was easy and straightforward. the place was very comfortable. highly recommend!we had an excellent stay in daniel\\'s home. he was very helpful and gave us great tips on local venues and restaurants. the community was great as well, and the very easy access to grocery stores and transit was a plus. i would definitely recommend to anyone looking to visit san francisco. the apartment is just so charming, with impeccable taste and a lot of charm.  the rugs! i loved the rugs! the place is very spacious and looked exactly like it was represented in the photos, and also was very clean and neat.  location was perfect, with so much on offer in the surrounding neighborhood.  daniel was a gracious host and was ready to offer any help.  he was also very easy to reach if i needed anything.  (i only had one job in the place and that\\'s to water the plants as part of a clever way to conserve water. i hope i did a good job!) staying at daniel\\'s place was absolutely wonderful!! it was exactly as it appeared in pictures, and completely spotless! my rather large sedan fit in the garage, and the top floor apartment was easy to access and check in and out of. the neighborhood is great, within walking distance to the mission and all its great restaurants. the kitchen was a joy to cook in, and wonderful for its open floor plan. loved the fireplace and the record player. the beds were comfy and sheets, towels, and toiletries were all provided! daniel was super responsive, and wonderful to communicate with! cannot recommend enough! one of the best and easiest airbnb experiences i\\'ve ever had!the house is so cute. living there is like i go back to home.daniel\\'s home was exactly as advertised, it was clean, quiet, spacious and well-maintained.  instructions were clear and he was easy to communicate with.  we had an initial issue about check out time -- he requested we depart our last day at 9 am to accommodate his house cleaner\\'s schedule, but we were ultimately able to work out a later check out time that was convenient for all parties.  we had a amazing stay in noe valley. daniel was an excellent host!

we mostly ubered around the city and the flat is right at the 280 entrance. we took bart a few times too and it was a nice mile or so walk to/from the 24th st. station. i\\'m sure we could have take. muni and it would have been even more convenient but we were enjoying ourselves. if there was more time, we\\'d have taken advantage of the hot tub! would be lucky to stay at daniel\\'s again if he\\'d have us. the listing was accurate and ever as beautiful as the photos. i loved his laminated note he left with instructions of how to use everything and what to pay attention to - made being in a new place so easy! we came as a family to hang out with our son who moved to sf a year ago. dan\\'s home was great! we had plenty of room and loved the sf vibe. we cooked several meals as the kitchen had everything a chef would need. the location was comfortable with a great coffee shop and grocery near by. we found this a great place to stay and venture out to see the city. we also took a day trip to sonoma and muir woods which was amazing. thanks dan for sharing your great space.we enjoyed our stay. everything was as expected.daniel and megan met us at the agreed upon time and the space available worked well for our family and we were even in a position to provide dinner to friends in the area which was a nice treat from eating out. the opportunity to have both indoor and outdoor space plus parking fit our needs perfectly. the neighbourhood felt very safe with nice options for coffee, ice cream and a grocery store within a couple of blocks. the street is on main transportation routes which although convenient does increase the road noise during the \"windows open\" months. the sleeping areas are quieter. we truly enjoyed the advantages of the space for our visit.daniel was a lovey host.   very caring and accommodating to us.  the place is new and very clean.   parking is a little tight but squeeze a bmw x5 in there.  street parking is too bad unlike some parts of the city.   daniel\\'s home is wonderful and had all the amenities we needed for our visit.  daniel met us when we first arrived, showed us around, and then let us enjoy his gorgeous place.  we chose his home primarily because of the kitchen - we wanted to cook a grand meal for the family and it was perfect!  important to us was to have a quiet place and despite being on a busy street, you never really hear the noise, especially from the bedrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we return to the city, we\\'ll certainly stay with daniel.my boss and i arrived in sf with a housing emergency. daniel responded right away and could accommodate us. his apartment is beautiful, in a great neighborhood and perfect for people traveling on business who want some privacy. the jacuzzi was a bonus! and although the the garage is tight we got the hang of it during our stay and we\\'re thankful to have it since street parking is hard in the neighborhood. daniel recommended a great place to get burritos nearby and he was really awesome when we met him.great place!  awesome stay and piano was greatdaniel\\'s place is every bit as beautiful as the photos. it provided a wonderful \\'home from home\\' to relax in while we visited the city, and met up with our son. location is excellent, amazing views and lovely cafes and restaurants nearby at bernal heights....had great food at \\'bernal star\\' cafe. kitchen and laundry facilities superb. garage parking was a fantastic bonus, as we used the car more than expected to explore the area. really easy access to the airport too. daniel was courteous and extremely accommodating, offering us flexibility on check in and check out. all in all, a wonderful  airbnb experience in a beautiful home. this was a really really nice place!!!

i highly recommend this room and location for your visit to my favorite city by the bay, san francisco.    my wife and i spend 3 nights in the suite of suzanne. it is a nice, convenient base to explore sf. it is situated in a little, rather luxury top hill secluded quater. at night there is a night watch. so we could park our car very safely and for free. it has its own private entrance, privacy guaranteed. we spend little time in the suite so we did not use the kitchenette. cooking is not possible but there is a microwave, fridge, coffee machine and a hot water facility. bathroom is very  nice and pleasant. so the bed.\\r\\nit is easy to go downtown by public transport. busses 10 minutes walk and about 35 minutes ride. buy a day card, not always cheaper but very handy. we did a nice walk through the nearby presidio park to the marina district. we recommend this suite specially if you like a luxury place and surroundings and if you travel by car.great stay! easy and convenient and a good value. thanks, suzanne!the space was accurately advertised.  the accommodations were outstanding - private, very clean and comfortable in a very safe, upscale neighborhood.  i would book this space again when in town.the suite is a perfect place to stay in san francisco. it is extremely private, comfortable and calm, and yet close to the nice neighborhoods especially pacific heights and north beach (at least by car as this is how we moved around). we really enjoyed our stay and have nothing to complain about. would stay there again. no need to look further, suzanne’s guest house is a perfect place to stay while visiting san francisco!  the exclusive neighborhood is very safe with ample parking and privacy.  it is located right next to presidio park and a close drive or uber ride to downtown sf.  the room is tastefully decorated with amenities such as a small fridge, microwave, dishes, iron, wi-fi, tv, etc. the bed, while full size, is very comfortable and inviting.  you will feel like you are in a hotel but at a very affordable price for sf.  suzanne and her assistant, kristy, were wonderful hosts, always quick to reply and providing a seamless check in and check out process.  i would highly recommend this location when visiting sf as we had a wonderful experience. we enjoyed our stay greatly!

i enjoyed my stay at suzanne\\'s property. everything was as described. i would say it\\'s a better alternative to staying at a hotel.  very efficient and responsive to my call upon arrival everything was superb!\\r\\nbeautiful room, great neighborhood, and amazingly quiet! i love the secluded and private feel of the property.\\r\\ni was here on a business trip so having a place to park was crucial. comfy bed, great shower, huge closet\\r\\nwould definitely book here again!my experience was great. very comfortable, clean, and cozy. no complaints. highly recommended!the communication between suzanne and her assistant was great and they were very accommodating! i loved the ambiance and setting inside & outside the listing. the little touches impressed me..from water bottles to soap & shampoo.  it was warm, clean, safe, luxurious and by far 100% better than a hotel. the listing was quiet and peaceful. the bed and bedding were beyond comfortable, the height of the ceiling made the suite feel so much bigger and the shower was amazing (i haven\\'t had water pressure like that in years!). there are corner stores in the immediate vicinity & a mel\\'s drive-in just a couple blocks away. although i didn\\'t have a car, i never had to wait more than 10 mins for an uber. overall, this business traveler had a wonderful experience. i can\\'t wait to bring my husband back for a sf trip together. there is no where else i would prefer to stay in the city. thanks suzanne!had a great stay for our trip to sf. terrific suite in an amazing location.this suite is in a gated neighborhood just south of the presidio, so you have the advantage of safety and a beautiful park nearby. i am grateful that suzanne was willing to accommodate my request for a blender and a coffee maker. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe reasons i\\'m giving it only 2 stars are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. wi-fi internet was unreliable on my first 2 days and then stopped working completely. while suzanne\\'s assistant sent a technician the next morning after i brought up the issue, my computer connectivity was only solved with an ethernet cable, so i still did not have wi-fi for my mobile devices for the remaining days of my stay. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. the door knob/locking system is very tricky. the owner had a warning on their list of instructions, but that didn\\'t make it any easier. the knob is too close to the door\\'s \"inner-frame,\" so your hand can\\'t fully grasp the knob (their technician had trouble too). it took me a few times of practicing and i finally figured out that i needed to use my 2 right fingers to rotate the left knob... to lock the door from the outside, you need to pull the handle all the way up, otherwise it doesn\\'t lock, so a little practice there is needed too.  \\r\\n\\r\\n3. the sink in the main room does not drain well. it takes a while for the water to go down the drain. \\r\\n\\r\\n4. while i take full responsibility for accidentally dropping the key on my way out one day (and thankfully, finding it on my way back), that tiny little key could use a key chain, so it\\'s not so easy to loose it.    \\r\\n\\r\\n5. maybe most importantly, i didn\\'t feel welcome there. it\\'s a strange situation because the suite is located right between the family\\'s garage and their back yard, so i\\'d see the kids playing, someone walking in and out of the garage, people talking in front of the house, so there is life around you. but for the nearly 2 weeks i was there, no one ever came to say hello. it\\'s not that i need chatting (i was busy working) but just a quick welcoming hello can make a world of difference of how one feels when inhabiting the back of a family\\'s home. \\r\\n\\r\\nanyway, i trust that the owners will resolve most if not all of the issues listed here by the time you decide to rent, but i feel it\\'s to everyone\\'s benefit (including the owners) that i be fully honest about my assessment. especially at the rate suzanne is charging, i would have preferred to stay at a place where issues like wi-fi, a user-friendly lock, and a fully functioning sink are handled before i walk in the room, and where the owners - if present - are welcoming people. \\r\\n\\r\\nsincerely and respectfully,\\r\\n\\r\\nsylvie the guest suite was perfect for my stay in the city. you cannot ask for better location and accommodation then suzanne\\'s guest suite. the guest suite is exactly as shown in the profile, plus very clean! i also liked the proximity to presidio park, clement street, and western addition. i would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the city but little bit away from the congested business district.presidio terrace is a prestigious neighborhood and we felt safe and quiet staying there. suzanne\\'s in law unit is small but immaculate. little details are also appreciated, nice bath towels, hand soap, a good mattress, a high pressure showerhead etc. parking was easy and pt had security at night, which was definitely a luxury for this city!i would highly recommend this place to anyone. it\\'s a small room with a bathroom, so definitely only suitable for 2 people, but for 2 people it\\'s perfect. it has the feel of a hotel without being a hotel. there was even a bar of chocolate (won my heart right there)! it was very clean and well decorated. the area is beautiful and quiet and feels very safe. with uberpool it was a cheap and quick ride to anywhere we were going in the city. there are restaurants and coffee shops about 10-15 minute walk away as well if you\\'re looking to walk for food. suzanne was very helpful in answering any questions we had and next time we come to san francisco, we\\'ll definitely be looking to stay here again! safe area and nicely decorated. very close of the main bus line.\\nwe did not meet the host or her assistant but everything is made to get the key!\\nwe were unfortunate as we had ants inside the room and the wifi was not working so well... for the price paid we are disappointed.\\nperfect location for our trip to san francisco.  lovely suite for two people in a beautiful gated neighborhood.incredible location, excellent amenities, beautiful and tranquil setting.  great bed, parking, awesome shower, wifi great, fell in love with the area.   excellent communication regarding our stay.  site was what we expected.  very clean and even though in the city quite secluded.  for our needs, it was very convenient to our daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter.  it would be a great location for anyone traveling to sf as it is close to public transportation and parking is available, which is sometimes troublesome in sf.  i would stay here again and most likely will in the future.extremely pleasant stay with this host. i would highly recommend this location if you\\'re looking for a secluded, high-quality room. this was a beautiful place to stay tucked away in one of the most amazing spots i have ever seen. a great spot for two people to get away. very upscale accommodations.  everything was just as described. super quiet area. i definitely had no worries leaving my car in there. i actually hope to book this every year! this was my first air bnb stay and i don\\'t think i will be able to match it ever again!very nice room and good location. everything was perfect.one of the easiest and most beautiful rentals i\\'ve stayed in. everything was exactly as advertised, and any questions i had were responded to almost instantly.\\ni would easily stay again.everything was as stated. quaint. quiet. elegant!lovely place! we enjoyed our stay. i was very surprised to find an airbnb in one of san francisco\\'s most beautiful, quiet and private neighborhoods.  the room was pristine, with elegant finishes and fixtures, a comfortable bed, great sheets, and probably the best shower system we\\'ve ever used.  though i didn\\'t get to meet suzanne or her assistant alex, communication by text was clear and timely.  a parking pass was provided for the very safe street (this is one of just a few gated neighborhoods in the city)--which is a huge bonus, if you\\'ve tried to park in sf lately--so my daughter and i were able to walk to most of our events and uber to the rest. strong wifi signal for work and study, plus fresh tulips and scharffen berger! i hope this place is available next time i head to san francisco.everything was spot on! very nice neighborhood and the room was tastefully decorated, a lot of attention to detail. i will definitely go back and we highly recommend it.nice room, good location. tv didnt work, thermostat permanently on 76. when contacted host, he said \"open a window.\\'\\' tv fixed 2nd night, required a conference call w/the cable company. could have used more drinking glasses than the 2 water glasses provided. double bed is small for two people.\\r\\n\\r\\nhosts nice enough, but for nearly $300 a night, expected better. won\\'t be back. wouldn\\'t recommend it.diane & i had a wonderful stay.  suzanne\\'s space is a fantastic location:  we prefer quiet & have a car so not being adjacent to retail/restaurants was fine - much preferred was the walk proximity to the presidio trails. the room though modest in space is pristine, expertly prepared, comfortable, functional & private.  we\\'d traveled lightly into town for dinner nye dinner engagements.  suzanne was friendly & communicative:  i enthusiastically recommend the space for a single traveler or a couple traveling light.i booked this for my boss, who was having a hard time getting a hotel near the presidio this week.  he enjoyed his stay in the suite immensely; it was clean, modern, convenient and the communication was excellent.  wouldn\\'t hesitate to book this again!the room was in a great neighborhood. very quiet and close to everything. it was like staying in a hotel the way it was decorated. my husband was in sf for business and i got to tag-a-long. we didn’t meet suzanne or her assistant, briana, in person but the instructions they left for the home were clear and our airbnb communication was great. \\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nsuzanna’s private suite was beautifully done and extremely well kept, just wonderful. the full size bed was small but the mattress was very comfortable. the custom closets housed extra down bedding and towels, the kitchenette had ample dinnerware, flatware and glasses, and the water pressure in the shower was excellent. and having parking was a huge plus.\\r\\n\\r\\na minor note to our stay is the home got a bit damp. our bathmat and hand towels never dried and we left the heater higher than we normally would at night to try and dehumidify the air. summer in the presidio :)\\r\\n\\r\\nabout a 0.5 mi easy walk (not hilly) to nourish cafe for a plant-based breakfast and organic coffee. about a 0.5 mi moderate walk (hilly) to inspiration point at the presidio for a fantastic vista.\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\np.s. be careful of the clearance between the front door and the desk chair. (our apologies again, suzanne!)\\r\\nsuzanne\\'s place was exactly how it is described in the listing. the location is really beautiful and the surrounding silent. i liked the place and would love to stay at suzanne\\'s again. a business colleague and i stayed here during a conference. the apartment is well-appointed and perfectly located relative to the union square area. there are three bathrooms and two bedrooms. the bedrooms are located at opposite ends, separated by a kitchen area, so there is considerable privacy between the two bedrooms. i would highly recommend this apartment. we had a great stay in this apartment. the hosts are very friendly and accomodating.  we are a family of 5 and we were very comfortable. our family had a great experience staying here. was me and my husband and 3 small girls. place was exactly as described.\\nlots of room, very kid friendly and in a great location. rob was very responsive and a very gracious host. would definitely stay here again. rob was a great host, very responsive and made sure he had his place prepared perfectly for us. he has a great place in a fantastic location, i would highly recommend it. rob & his wife are extraordinary hosts in every aspect. their very large, modern, comfortable home is located in the perfect part of san fran.  my family can\\'t wait to stay there again.  truly amazing!!!\\nthanks rob & family,\\npaulneighborhood was fantastic with corner markets everywhere and trader joe\\'s and whole foods just a few blocks away.  the listing description was accurate because the place was large and spacious beyond belief.  it worked beautifully as a home base for a 12-person family gathering with 7 people at this condo, 3 at another one two blocks away, and 2 more at another condo a few more blocks away.  because we had my 94 year old mother in a wheelchair, and we couldn\\'t handle the steep hills with the wheelchair, we used uber around town with ease.  the host, rob, accommodated some special requests around the timing of check in and check out and was even there upon arrival to show us around.   my family gathering was a complete success due to this host and his wonderful home!beautiful home, comfortable accommodations and great hosts!love staying here! my favorite home away from home .we had a great time in sf , michelle has a very lovely home , bright daylight radiates through out her home , and was very clean , the view from the liking room was a great back drop and the view from the park from across the street were breathtaking postcard worthy , from the golden gate to the east bay . big thank you to michelle for welcoming us to her home . i will be looking the availability of this place again when i come back . \\n\\nglenn excellent place to stay. the house is very clean with excellent bathrooms/showers and lounging areas. kitchen has very nice stove, fridge, and dish washer. located in an end unit right along the park, there is also ample parking. \\r\\n\\r\\nshort walk to grocery store, restaurants, and wine shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nseller was very responsive to all inquiries and messages. \\r\\n\\r\\ni am very pleased with our stay here. \\r\\n\\r\\nsuch a beautiful and unique home, beautifully decorated and centrally located. scott was great at updating us and making sure we had what we needed. would happily stay here again. thank you for a great visit!we really lucked out with this place. it\\'s gorgeous and cozy and comfortable and features awesome views of the city throughout the house. elana and lew were wonderfully accommodating and we felt very much at home with everything we needed and more during our 8 day stay. it was a perfect spot for 2-3 adults and 2 babies, and i was able to walk to work at the castro in just 15 minutes, straight over a little mountain with a 360 view of sf. this is a dream spot. this home was perfect for a week-long stay for our family of three. nicely furnished, very quiet, with beautiful views of the city. street parking was easy to find. public transportation just out the door. lewis was a pleasure to deal with, with prompt replies whenever we contacted him. would definitely stay here again.the place is clean, all the amenities you could ask for, and in a great location. mo is a super gracious host - he checked in on me during the weekend to make sure everything was cool, and showed me how to work everything! great experience, would definitely do it again. thanks, mo!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(for tmobile users - no cell reception inside the condo. the wi-fi is great, though! just made voip calls in the condo.)very helpful host, hospitable and trusting. conveniently located near transit and valencia. super comfy bed and clean and well-appointed apt. thanks for the hospitality mo!rachel and heather were excellent hosts!  the check-in process was seamless, their place was clean and well-equipped, and it is located in a cool area within walking distance to many places.  also, the suggestions they left for places to go were great!  we\\'d recommend them and will look them up if ever we are back in san francisco.we had the enjoyable time in camille\\'s lovely house,her unique creativity arts and adorably pictures. that\\'s amazing experience in san francisco.really recommend it.i stayed at camille\\'s excellent apartment along with three colleagues while we attended a conference in san francisco. the apartment suited us perfectly - it has a great location and had plenty of space for the four of us to relax in. being recently refurbished the apartment had all the modern amenities we expected. \\n\\nunfortunately, i never had the opportunity to meet camille during the stay. however, she was very friendly with all the requests we had and was always very quick to respond. \\n\\nwe stayed during an unusually cold december so the apartment was a little chilly since it has no central heating (heating is provided by an electric heater in the main living space along with a gas fire in the front living room). camille was excellent though and she very quickly provided us with extra blankets so it was no problem. \\n\\nsince a few of us are upwards of 1.9m in height, the beds were a little short but it was never a particular problem. it should also be noted that noise from the neighbours can be heard due to the stye of the houses in this part of san francisco. this also means guests need to be a little quiet so as not to disturb the neighbours. \\n\\nall in all a great apartment that perfectly matched our requirements.the house is so cute and crean! we loved it.\\r\\nshe helped us so much even we have caused her trouble many times. thanks!!good host. good roommates. nice place. will stay here again if i can :) great place and clean! host was very nice! for this price and in the city, right by bart/muni? doesn\\'t hurt that the apartment is pretty amazing as well. definitely staying here again next time i\\'m in sf. gatz did a great job, meeting me and letting me into the property. he then showed me around and made sure i was comfortable and aware of all the amenities.great place to stay, the host is more than accommodating - i would surely stay here again, not to mention the other tenants are always extraordinarily interesting. my stay at gatz place was great.  i was there while apartment hunting and it\\'s central location was ideal for that.  gatz was also a big help!  i\\'ve stayed at very inexpensive airbnb places in sf (on friends account) before and as a rule these places are not very nice.  things like air mattress, no heat in 40 degree weather and entry through the window not very nice.  which is fine as they are cheap.  i was expecting similar for this place, but the apartment and the building are in fact really high quality.  gatz makes an effort to make sure the stay is comfortable and enjoyable.  the only warning i have is the room is shared with other people, if that\\'s not something you can handle the place isn\\'t for you.gatz was a great host, very flexible! i had a great time in san fransisco! highly recommend!gatz was very welcoming and friendly, the check in process was smooth.  gatz has a beautiful home to share with professionals.  i am so grateful for his hospitality and attention to detail!  the standard of the apartment is very high (though i think the photo that is pictured is not the photo of our kitchen).  nonetheless, the apartment is superb and the people are from different backgrounds with so much to learn from each other.  thank you gatz for organizing a fantastic stay, much appreciated!  :)gatz, this shared home is just great! i\\'ve met there great people. looky home is really nice to stay.gatz was super duper amazing .. i really love that the apartment is new , the facilities is superb i was blown away by the design of the apartment.  and gatz was super friendly,we had a wonderful chat about life and technology.. its one of my favourite place to stay in sf .. next time i definitely will wanna return there !! gatz was quick to respond to my questions, welcoming and friendly.  looky home is more than a place to stay, it\\'s like becoming part of a professional family.  i was really happy with the accommodations (great gym, great living quarters) and the company.  smart, driven professionals that were open and friendly and made me feel at home.  i would definitely stay again and again.the host canceled this reservation 32 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.great apartment. beds could be better and you have to be prepared that staying 4 people in one bedroom there will be some noise. people not going to bed at the same time, not waking up at the same time, snoring etc. besides that i had a great stay with some lovely people in the apartment. about the neighborhood then you will find homeless people no matter where you stay in sf, so this was just like any other place in sf. great facilities with lounge area with bbq\\'s free to use and a gym at 2nd floor.in one word \\'awesome\\'.  i have never stayed in a shared accommodation before and thought i never would.  i was stuck for a cost effective place to stay in the bay area for work. stumbled across \\'looky\\' and thought \\'yeah right, too good to be true!\\'  but had to book anyway.  my flight was unavoidably delayed, gatz still looked after me, stayed up to let me in, show me around the place and make me feel welcome, the place was amazing, very clean, top notch condo and building facilities and gatz came back to check on me during the week.   this place just rocked and gatz was a total rock star all round.  i made a new friend and really enjoyed the company i had in the condo for the week.  i would highly recommend any \\'looky\\' location to anyone.   thank you gatz.  rk. great stay!!!\\r\\nmatan made me feel very welcome by leaving an immaculate apartment and some helpful directions (because i asked in advance). he really took great care to make sure i will feel at home and it is greatly appreciated.\\r\\nas for the area - i personally loved it. it has so many cool things to see and do like great bars and restaurants, walk to the marina, close to public transportation and with all that it was quite at night time so i was able to sleep well and enjoy the days.\\r\\ni would recommend the place and i am sure that i will stay here again next time i\\'m in sf easy to deal with. a great solution next to the uni! would recommend. irina\\'s place is beautifully clean and stylish with the artistic wooden decor. it was just right for my dad and me, close to both golden gate park and the bridge. the new kitchen and bedsheets were a treat, but most of all, irina, yuri, and their son were super helpful, communicative, and thoughtful - it makes all the difference to have caring hosts even when you don\\'t meet in person! as it was a newly remodeled home the internet and tv were not functional yet but will be soon. this is the perfect place to have a space of your own from which to explore san francisco. thank you!great place to stay for the price. the location of house was perfect to relaxing(golden gate park), sightseeing(golden gate bridge), and shopping(25m to civic centre & union square). we had a great time at irina\\'s place. it\\'s also suitable place for business trip. the room is enough for family or couple, and has enough furnitures & equipments. a secured, private courtyard & dining table is also good to enjoy.good communication, place was clean and comfortable. i felt safe there.the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we had a very pleasant stay and awesome sleeping nights (since i often have a hard time sleeping, good beds and little noise mean everything to me). irina was very supportive when we asked for some items by promptly providing us with new ones. he was very welcoming and knew a great deal about the area, especially good food places. he\\'s totally chill and very friendly... i recommend staying with him anytime! robert was a very welcoming and accommodating host. both my flights to and from san francisco were delayed, and he was really cool about having me arrive later and letting me stay as long as i needed. the room was nice and clean, and exceeded my expectations--the lighting\\'s warmer than pictured! and as a musician, he had instruments set up in the living room, which he welcomed me to play, and was happy to answer questions i had about a piano bar i was thinking of checking out. overall, if you\\'re looking for a nice place to stay and a host who\\'s happy to chat with you, and also cool about letting you do your own thing, robert\\'s your guy. thanks again, robert!clean room, helpful and friendly host. convenient area close to public transportation.robert was fine, accepted the reservation right away.  provided clear directions and recommendations to restaurants within walking distance.  he allowed me to put my bicycle in the house overnight for safekeeping.robert was a great host.  i had great information before i arrived about how to find the place and how to get in.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place itself is pretty good, decent bed in a quite room.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location to the bart is not too bad either, less than a 10 minute walkrobert was a great host, very friendly and knowledgeable about the area, and was even kind enough to let me jam on his guitars. the location was quiet, safe, and conveniently close to downtown and public transportation.robert is a great host. thanks for showing me the sf crimemap. really helpful haharobert\\'s a great host! made me feel like home. the description is quite accurate and the neighborhood is safe and calm. deserves a 5/5. robert was great, needed a place to stay for last minute work gig in sf. drums in the living room were awesome!!hal and his family is really accommodating and super friendly when i first moved into his place. as new to the city, hal and his family are really considerate and thoughtful for answering any questions that could guide my tour in the city. in addition, living environment is very clean, quiet, safe, and pleasant. i really enjoyed being \"part\" of his family.great place, great hosts, great cereal for the breakfast! awesome family, felt like home. private room.  quite and safe neighborhood,  food co just a block away, police station at corner of street. most important really convenient commute to downtown with frequent express bus. thanks halgreat place,great hosts,great everything.room is clean,charming,very nice.hal and his family are very friendly and easy to talk to. they told us everything a first-time visitor should know about san francisco and even drove us one evening to the twin peaks and the mission district to experience the local sf as opposed to the touristy side of it. the transport options from their place are good -bus or tram within 10 mins of their house. express lines are fast but on those days they don\\'t run (weekends if i remember correctly) count with ~45 mins to get downtown. the house is smaller but very cosy. parthena,hal\\'s wife was doing her best to make us feel welcome and we loved staying with them. the listing description was accurate. room was clean and well organized. getting around was easy with bus stop within 10 minutes. hosts were great though i could meet them only on the second day. but hal made sure i had no issues finding the place and the room. thanks hal. surely recommend it.the host made us feel very welcome. his wife is the friendliest ever.  the room was exactly how it was described in the listing.  i would definitely stay here again! thanks hal! :) we really enjoyed our stay at hal\\'s place! he and his family are really nice and helpful. all of them made us feel welcome!\\nthe room was comfy and clean and a bunch of tourist information is placed on the nightstand. \\nbus stop is close in walking distance and takes you downtown in 20 min. even the non-express bus is pretty quick. \\nwe can definitely recommend this place! \\nwe wish those lovely people just the best!hal and parthena were very welcoming. their beautiful house is exactly as pictured, an affordable grocery store minutes away, in a clean and quiet neighbourhood. i would definitely stay with them again.very nice family, they treat me very well and made sure i was feeling comfortable and had everything i needed. it was my first experience with airbnb, and it was great!! thank you epstein family :) i\\'ll go back for sure! hal and his family were great. his house was very comfortable and close to my commute route. he was open to my schedule which was not crazy, but i was out early and back late. there was one night that i did not stay during my booked week and hal reached out to me to make sure everything was ok and that i could get into the house if i came back very late. the room is exactly as pictured and the entire house is well kept. i would recommend staying here for anyone that appreciates a calm environment. hal and his family are really nice hosts who warmly welcome you and also gave me the privacy that i needed. we had a great time in san francisco and hal and his family were great hosts. they were helpful with restaurant info and friendly roommates. have a great time in sf and really happy to know you family! \\nhope i can back to there in future.hal and his family were a great host! the home was very easy to find and close to restaurants and everything. i did have a hard time finding parking...i drove around for about 30 minutes friday night looking for parking but that was mainly because it was around 1:30am. note to future guests: try the next street (parallel) over for parking if you come home late at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nother than that, i loved staying here!hal\\'s place was amazing. he and his wife were very hospitable and even made dinner. this is one of the best airbnb and the value was great. be prepared to uber or take one of the busses about 9 mins away to get to downtown san francisco. will definitely use when i\\'m back in san francisco!hal and his family were absolutely wonderful and helpful about suggestions for the city. thank you again!hal is really a very nice superhost. i had a great time with the family. the house is easy to find following hal\\'s instructions and (sensitive contents hidden) map. the room is nice and is exactly as pictured. it provided almost everything i need. hal and his wife gave me traveling tips about the city which was very helpful. again nice to meet you and thank you very much!pros:\\r\\n- hal and his family are super kind.  very easy going.\\r\\n- the pictures are very accurate.  the room is good sized and the bed is comfy & cable tv in the room!\\r\\n- free street parking (we got a spot that was right out front).\\r\\n- close walk (less than 10 mins) to both major bus stops.\\r\\n- close to grocery store.\\r\\n- lots of room in their garage (anything you wanted to take out of your car you could store in their garage).\\r\\n- they have fruit and a few other items that are offered for breakfast!\\r\\n\\r\\nneutral but noteworthy:\\r\\n- we had a bag that had an open chocolate bar and a closed small container of honey sitting in our room.  after being gone for the day sightseeing, we came back to find the bag and surrounding area covered with sugar ants.  we killed most of them and hal\\'s wife provided us with some ant poison to sprinkle around the edges of the room.  it was taken care of quickly and efficiently so not really a negative experience as these things happen, just wish we would have been warned if that is an issue as we’ve never experienced sugar ants take over so much so quickly with something so small.  \\r\\n\\r\\ncons:\\r\\n- it took about an hour to get to anything we wanted to see (by public transit).  it\\'s usually a 40 min bus ride plus 7-10 mins of walking on each side.\\r\\n- the room has big frosted windows at the top of the wall that goes out into the hallway, so if your room won\\'t be dark until everyone else goes to bed (which was between 12-1).\\r\\n- the room is next to the living room, so it\\'s not quiet until everyone goes to bed (which was between 12-1).\\r\\n- the bathroom does not have a fan, so it\\'s pretty moist.hal and his family were very welcoming. the place was as advertised and clean. nice place to stay if you plan on sightseeing but don\\'t want to spend the big bucks on a hotel in the city. an uber to the pier 33 to catch the alcatraz cruise was about $12. hal also helped us plan our trip to yosemite, which was our next stop. this was my first airbnb experience and after this i would do it again. hal and his family are generous and helpful. the room is quite comfortable, and the location is good, a few blocks from the t street car. \\nvegetarians may notice the aroma of meat cooking to be somewhat strong in the evening. lights out is about midnight, before that time  tv and family conversation are not obtrusive, but clearly overheard. \\nrecommended for seasoned travelers willing to trade a bit of privacy for a decent price (for san francisco!)hal was a very pleasant and welcoming host. he offered tips about the local area which were very helpful! the room was clean and tidy (and as per the description). the location was also great, easily accessible from the airport and close to downtown. i enjoyed the staying at hal\\'s home , my room is cozy and the bed very comfortable , house is super clean , the decoration that on the wall looks nice ! the location also good , easy to reach all visita point ! hal and his family all very friendly ! it is my first time in san francisco , under hal\\'s instruction , only two days , i enjoyed san francisco as much as possible , definitely gonna come back here and high recommend stay in hal\\'s home ! hal and his family are all very friendly and enthusiastic the room is very comfortable is also very good geographical location, traffic is convenient, this is a pleasant experience, thank them very much.this is a wonderful place to stay at! hal and his family were very nice, friendly and helpful. i could also talk to them a lot and we really had interesting conversations. the bed is probably one of the comfortable beds i have ever slept on and there is a lot of room.hal and is familly are very friendly.  the well advise me on the different places i can visit with pertinent information.\\r\\nthe room was very quiet and peaceful and the \"greek\" lunch quite good.i had an amazing time staying with hal and his family. they were very helpful and pleasant and made me feel right at home. the price was also very reasonable. i would definitely stay here again.located between airport and downtown, this house is very appropriate for those who\\'re interested in exploring sf. if you rent a car, parking is also very convenient.  hal is a great talker. several conversation with him help me learn the real life of sf. in addition, his suggestions for other trip to monterey is  very helpful!it was great time with hal\\'s family, they were very friendly and kind. especially hall is amazing host and he tried best to provide us in good condition, thanks hal :)welcoming, friendly, and accommodating are just a few of the words i would use to describe hal and his family\\'s humble abode. the room was clean and comfortable; just as it was portrayed in the room\\'s description. deciding to stay at hal\\'s was as great decision. we decided to leave our car and uber the entire weekend and it was only $9 maximum from hal\\'s. the room was nice, comfortable, and clean and his family made us feel so welcomed. what i loved most about this bed and breakfast was the price! we couldn\\'t find a better deal in san fran. we will definitely book here again! we were very please our stay was average. the bed was firm, but overall a good place to stay. the price is the best thing about this location! it\\'s very fair. \\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, the house was a little dusty. my boyfriend and i were sneezing the whole time. our allergies were off the wall. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe probably wouldn\\'t stay again, but this location could be good for other people! this place seems to be especially good if you are traveling alone, as the walls are very thin and you can hear what is going on in the rooms surrounding you. \\r\\n\\r\\nnot my greatest experience staying at an airbnb, but also, not my worst. the room is very cozy and comfortable. hal and his wife pathina are very friendly and considerate. and the location is convenient to the downtown. we really enjoyed it.both calendar son made me feel very welcome and it was a very nice room they made me feel right at home.hal, his wife and son are just awesome! thanks for treating me like part of your family. i will def stay there again when i\\'m in sf!!!i thoroughly enjoyed my stay with hal and his wife. both are very nice people and they were willing to help me navigate sf during my stay. moreover, hal provided detailed instructions during my stay, which were very helpful. overall, the room is very clean and comfortable. in addition, the new bathroom is very clean and nice. i stayed with hal while i interviewed and his home is close to the airport and was ideal for commuting to my interview and back to the airport. lastly, the price is great!\\n\\nwhen i come back to look for apartments, i will certainly try to stay with hal. \\n\\nthanks for you kindness and generosity, hal!the host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the stay in deepika\\'s home was wonderful, it\\'s a very modern building with all the amenities you need to be properly taken care of. his home had beautiful views of the city throughout most of the entire apartment, and in a nice location where noise is a minimum. i would gladly return to his home again for another visit. deepika was a terrific host - extremely responsive and easy to deal with. the apartment is very nice - great living room and entertainment system, a big open kitchen and a comfortable bed. i would definitely stay here again.the reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this place is beautiful!  the view is everything you could ask for.  it\\'s nicely decorated and very clean.  parking is a bit tough but not impossible and it\\'s a great waking neighborhood.  great stay, will return.this is airbnb at its finest! the owner was extremely helpful throughout my entire trip even though she wasn\\'t around. communication was great and the view was magnificent!! you can\\'t save your trip to the twin peaks because the view is as good, if not better. the only thing i didn\\'t like was parking. no on-site parking was provided, only street parking, so please be aware of the street cleaning time when you park. other than parking, i will definitely stay here again if i ever visit sf!!after much consternation, anxiety and not an insignificant amount of frustration with regard to booking accommodation in san fran, i and my  travelling friends found this suspicious gem in the heart of san fran\\'s rolling terrain. i say suspicious only because it was reasonably priced, excellently located and wonderfully furnished. too good to exist we thought, after 3 days driving around nevada and california sleeping in a car and seedy motels on the outskirts of civilization! we booked susan\\'s divisadero spot the morning we were to arrive, and magnificently, she tolerated our (my) panicked and furtive messaging to try and lock it down before we drove from modesto, leaving the spurious confines of our motel. upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed into a home that surpassed our expectations and put its own airbnb advertisement to shame. susan sat our weary bones down in her living room where she offered us drinks (including barry\\'s tea [big deal for irish people away from home for so long!]) and enthusiastically inquired about our road trip thus far. the house was spotless with themed rooms throughout. 3 gorgeous double-bed rooms sat atop a modern but tasteful kitchen and living space that all-in allowed us to complete our month long journey is style and relaxation. susan laid out all the local and urban info we needed, including public transport details and local events. she was a truly wonderful host with a truly spectacular property which she gave to others as if they were her own. the five of us wanted for nothing and were overjoyed that she was always on hand to distribute advice and information in such a caring manner. for anyone who ends up here, i would advise you to listen with great care to her local recommendations for food, drinks and coffee; in four days she never once steered us wrong. indeed, it was our pleasure to stay here and if we ever find ourselves on the other side of the world again, struggling to beat bay bridge traffic or understand the sheer scale of san fran\\'s urban climbs, we will be the first in line to stay at susan\\'s divisadero home. susan\\'s home was a dream. she owns a classic 2-story victorian in lower pacific heights in san francisco and not only is it kept up impeccably, but she takes great care in who she selects to stay in her home and it shows. it\\'s very spacious with 4 rooms--all with double beds--2 full baths, and a fully fenced in yard (a difficult feat in the heart of san francisco!). her consistent communication and warm welcome were much appreciated by my family coming in from out of town, and having a safe place to keep our little dogs while we explored the city was unequivocal. couldn\\'t ask for a better location, and if you are lucky enough to stay at such a gorgeous place in the city jump on it and don\\'t look back!susan was a fabulous host and her house was lovely! we had a wonderful time and was very comfortable in the house. also a convenient location to everything!susan was a lovely host to our big group. she was very helpful with information and always up for a laugh. whenever i\\'m back in sf, that\\'s my place to stay. the neighbor hood is great too! highly recommend to stay with her!susan was very easy to communicate with and provided us with lots of information before we even arrived. the house was lovely and had everything we could\\'ve wished for. we were 4 colleagues visiting our sf hq from overseas, so it was important for each of us to have enough privacy - which we did. it\\'s a super comfortable and spacious home in an amazing neighbourhood - and you\\'ll find everything you need on the doorstep. susan made us feel welcome - and made sure we had everything we needed to have a great stay.  susan was very helpful in getting us settled in for a stay in her lovely home. the home is well situated for walking and for getting to the sights and scenes in and around san francisco. we booked the italianate victorian for our family of 9 to celebrate our anniversary.  one person had to sleep on the pull out sofa but that didn\\'t matter, the house perfect of us.  the house is beautifully decorated and in a wonderful location to see san francisco sights.  we enjoyed the location of the house which is among many old victorian homes and also close to a coffee shop, pastry shop, places to eat and a grocery store.  we had two rental cars which i thought might be a problem since there was only parking for one car.  however, we had no difficulty finding a place on the street to park the second car.  susan was available and ready to help out susan was an absolutely great host!  she was so funny and personable.  when our group got there, she had a welcome sign with all of our names and she even took us out for a round of drinks!  the house was charming and in a good location.  it fit all of our needs and we would definitely stay there again!hands down susan is one of the most welcoming and hospitable hosts i\\'ve met on or off airbnb.   she was a great communicator in the run up to our arrival and went out of her way to make sure the place was spotless before she arrived.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is gorgeous and very well laid out.   the lovely interior design has obviously been very well curated.  it\\'s located in fairly central neighborhood where the rest of the city is a short walk, shot on the muni, or cab ride away.   it\\'s also a great space to gather people together with it\\'s 4 bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nsusan was extremely gracious when we had to switch the location of a small gathering for my in-laws 50th wedding anniversary at the last minute to her house due to a plumbing issue at our original location.  it made a wonderful backdrop for a reunion of the original wedding party.  all of the guests loved the place.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend this listing and susan.  susan was such a gracious host! i had friends coming in from the east coast for my wedding and needed a place for them to stay. her home was stunningly beautiful and conveniently located for them to get around the city to all the tourist locations that they wanted to see. they said the rooms are spacious and had everything they needed. she was always around and easy to contact if we needed anything. all in all, i would highly recommend staying at susan\\'s house and will be keeping her info for any other times i have large groups coming to visit since it was such a great experience. definitely stay...you won\\'t regret it!susan is a great hostess. she has positive energy and is easy to communicate with. she is generous and flexible. \\nwhen our flight was delayed she adjusted with grace and generosity. \\nher home is lovely, clean, well located and better than the pictures.  seven of us were comfortable.  \\ni look forward to returning.susan was incredibly warm and welcoming. we arrived to a sign on the door welcoming our family. we were a family of nine and there was plenty of space in her home. we loved the backyard (a true gem in the middle of the city), and the location can\\'t be beat. there were plenty of cafes, restaurants, and bars close by and only a few blocks from fillmore street. susan was so friendly and stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed. we would love to return.great house! would def recommend to anyone with a large group.beautiful townhouse, great location, lots of shops and cafes in the neighborhood.  susan was very warm to show us the place upon arrival. i\\'d recommend this for any family that wants a local experience of living in sf!susan\\'s house was beautiful!  she was incredibly accommodating and helpful, despite being out of town.  we were very happy!susan was extremely helpful even though the circumstances of the timing were inconvenient. she was always willing to talk about any issues or solve problems. we greatly appreciate her help and her house! susan was easy to get in touch with and her house is lovely. we were there visiting family and there was enough room to not feel like we were on top of each other. the house was clean and beautifully decorated. the neighborhood is in a great spot close to lots of restaurants and shops. we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there in the future. although i did not have much interaction with the host, she made the check in process very easy, and everything went smoothly. we had a wonderful stay at susan\\'s house. susan was a great host responding promptly to our queries.this place is incredible.  perfect location-a hundred restaurants in every direction, quiet, private, and beautifully decorated.  there are 4 nice sized bedrooms and we were even able to squeeze the pack and play into a large closet so our 3 month old had her own little space too!  there\\'s a private fenced in back yard that was perfect for the kids. susan was the ultimate host-when we asked about a pack and play she posted on her neighbor network and we had neighbors offering up all kinds of things for us to borrow.  a great little community.  it is walking distance to an incredible park with a huge playground.  the kitchen is beautiful and has everything you would need.  one tip is that there is a lot of decor everywhere.  you can tell she has put her heart into her home.  so if you have rambunctious little ones this may not be a good fit for you unless you want to replace a lot of broken \"stuff\".  we have a 5 year old a 3 year old and an infant and we made it out without a break but i was a little stressed about it and we did go through and move breakable stuff when we got there.  also the front room is quite noisy with loud traffic so my husband and i took that room and put the little ones in the back.  it worked out fine.  bottom line is that you will be comfortable and accessible to everything here.  thank you susan!it was a wonderful experience. susan\\'s instructions were great, met me at the door and gave me a walk through. it was a wonderful experience for me and my team and very convenient by uber to get to the moscone center.susan was there to greet us, she was extremely friendly and accommodating, and we felt very welcomed.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is fantastic -- right in the heart of lower pac heights.  couldn\\'t be better.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is great.  the pictures are accurate, the home is comfy, and it was a great base for our family for a week!location is great. kitchen is well stocked with dishes, pots and pans, etc. bedding and towels are decent. back yard is a peaceful oasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nupstairs bathroom is very nice but the first floor bathroom is not what i expected from the description.  the shower head, toilet, and sink are in a very small space.  there\\'s no door or curtain around the shower so i\\'m not sure how one could shower without one\\'s towel and robe getting wet.  also, there was hair in the drain.  we opted not to use this shower.  \\r\\n\\r\\na walk through with the owner at check-in and check-out is highly recommended.  i\\'d also suggest that all correspondence be conducted through airbnb messaging.absolutely wonderful experience. we arrived in san francisco to another airbnb experience that was nothing as described. thankfully susan was able to accommodate us and it was everything as described and more. i was there with three work colleagues and we all loved it. the location was great. the house was super clean and well taken care of and it felt like home. susan went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. we will be back next year for the same conference and staying again. there were 8 of us on this trip to san francisco.  the house was plenty spacious for my family.  we were all arriving on different flights and unfortunately i didn\\'t get to meet susan in person.  my daughter arrived first.  however, i was in contact with her before and all during the trip.  she was very quick to respond and extremely helpful during our stay.  we turned her into our personal travel guide and she didn\\'t seem to mind.  the house had everything we needed.  we needed a cable to move some pictures off the camera.  instead of a run to best buy, we made a call to susan.  of course she had one.  the location was central to almost everything.  we had a little mishap as we were leaving for the airport.  susan assured us to not worry about it and wished us a safe trip home.for my next trip to san fransisco i will try to book this house again.   it was great.   this was such a convenient location.  so many shops and restaurants in walking distance.   susan was a great host.  she met us at the door and gave us a quick tour of her lovely home.   we would like to thank jason (and sandra) who welcomed us very nicely. the appartment was great, and has everything that could be needed, especially a big kitchen. the rooms are very confortable, despite the noisy atmosphere early in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe district wasn\\'t the most beautiful of the city and has many homeless people, but it is easy to reach the city center by metro or by taxi (about 15 $ from union square).\\r\\n\\r\\nwe shared the appartment with 4 other airbnb travellers, and we wished we had more than one bathroom for the 8 persons staying in the appartment at the same time.jason is a great guy and he showed us around really well. the apartment is as it looks in the photos and tidy and neat. he welcomed us with champagne on each room as well as beers in the fridge. he also gave us invaluable tips of where to eat and hang out!we had such a great trip thanks to jason! he have great advice on how and where to spend our short stay to make it full and unique. we stayed in the two adjoined rooms, both spaces were just as pictured, clean, and comfortable for the four of us. we were able to store our 3 bikes in the garage easily and renting another bike where he suggested worked well so we could cruise the city day and night (which i highly recommend). the free street parking was a miracle! over all, an excellent experience. i would recommend staying with jason to anyone who\\'s looking for a great space and location and a welcoming and helpful host.amazing host, very friendly, considerate and attentive all the time. i̇t has been an absolute pleasure being his guests! the bed was big and incredibly comfortable and the neighbourhood is full of mexican restaurants. it is close to the train and buses that can bring you to any other neighbourhoods around the city centre. we will definitely recommend the place!this place was fantastic! quite the host, and the house is beautiful. i hope to stay here again.our host contacted me a few days before to inquire about our desired check-in time. he also let us know that a family member would be acting on his behalf while he was on international travel. in addition, because i advised him that the other reservation at his home was a member of our party, he shared their estimated check-in time with us as well. \\r\\nhis mother was very nice and accommodating- no complaints about the host. we loved the tutorial on the espresso machine. we used it quite a bit. they also stock a few essentials for their guests in the fridge including eggs, dairy and almond milk. it was very much appreciated!\\r\\namong the 6 of us staying there, we had one common complaint- there were no screens on the windows. while we understand it\\'s not uncommon for their to be no air conditioning due to the typically mild climate, the windows need screens. in late july, it was too warm not to leave the windows open, but there was definitely a problem with mosquitos getting in the house.  our stay at jason\\'s was better than i could have expected! sandra, his mother, checked us in and was very welcoming. she gave us great advice and recommendations on where to eat. the rooms we stayed in we\\'re just as pictured. each room has its own key so you can safely leave the house knowing your belongings won\\'t be harmed. i also have to add that the bed was like sleeping on cloud. getting to public transportation was a breeze because the bart was only a 5 min walk to get to. the kitchen was also as pictured and more! if you wanted to stay in and make dinner, you\\'d have everything you need to complete your meal (i.e utensils, pots, pans, spices). there\\'s also brochures out for local restaurants and bars to try. the kitchen and bathrooms are shared but well kept/maintained. there are two bathrooms, with one being newly remodeled, which were always clean. overall, my friends and i enjoyed our stay at jason\\'s and would definitely come back if we are ever in the area again. the house is absolutely beautiful and is in a great location. the size exceed my expectations i honestly didn\\'t think it would be as big as it was. there was also an extensive selection of amenities that the host provided and it was proof that they really make the effort to stand out. would strongly recommend this listing and would stay again. thanks for having us :) great place, very clean, smelt great and a brilliant location.  jason wasn\\'t around but his mum was on board and very helpful with the organisation of everything.  incredible bedding, slept really well here. \\r\\ndidn\\'t realise we would be sharing with 2 other people (i may have missed this in the notes about the location) but we hardly noticed they were there.jason is an excellent host! the rooms my partner and i & our friends occupied were spotless, comfortable, and chic. i loved the large windows and tons of natural sunlight. jason was super helpful giving us around-the-city suggestions as well as accommodating any needs or requests we had.  above and beyond that, jason anticipates guest needs - shampoo, face wash, cereal, snacks, etc.,  all available as needed when we arrived and throughout the week. you\\'ll have a great time in san francisco if you stay here!i had a great time staying at stu\\'s \"mansion.\" the whole building is truly one of a kind with lots of extremely well-designed common spaces that came as welcome surprises (e.g. the downstairs complimentary espresso bar, the hidden tea/zen lounge, etc.). a lot of effort has been put into the design of this historic building. the room itself was of a good size with a minimalist but well-done aesthetic, and un-advertised high-end sound system, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nstu was easy to communicate with, though i never met him. check in was extremely easy, and he was able to accommodate my after-midnight check in time without any issue. i estimate the building to be upwards of 20,000 square feet with many many rooms, presumably available for tennants or guests. i never saw more than two other people in the building at a time, so i felt like i had the whole mansion to myself. \\r\\n\\r\\nfor those not familiar with san francisco, this location cannot be beat. it is centrally smack in the middle of the city, equidistant from every neighborhood. \\r\\n\\r\\ni look forward to my next opportunity to stay at the archbishop mansion.i have great time at looky home. amazing location with view. home is clean and have mostly everything you need. highly recommend for young traveler that travel alone and want a decent place to stay.  heigo was excellent.  he even picked me up to help me find the place.  very friendly and the place that we stayed in was fantastic.  i was very satisfied with my stay with heigo.  good people and a safe environment.  i would definitely plan to stay there again.heigo made us feel pretty welcome, introduced us to the other guests, and made sure to explain the facilities in detail. the apartment was reasonably clean and it\\'s in a great location. reasonable price, would stay again! i am so greatful for the stay at looky place.  the location was great and the accommodations were fantastic!  super clean and friendly guests.  will definitely stay here again!heigo was extremely friendly and a great host. the unit was very well kept and provided a great place to rest and recharge each day. the folks we met from japan who were also staying in the unit were fun and exciting. we would not have had this opportunity to branch out had we chose the traditional hotel route -- we are very happy with our decision. thanks for everything heigo.heigo is amazing and a has a whimsical personality! he made everyone feel right at home. i brought my car to the city (i know, don\\'t ask, ha) and heigo was nice enough to rent his parking space to me during my stay there for less than what parking garages offered in the area. i\\'d stay here again and recommend this airbnb to anyone looking to temporarily be in the city.the stay in the department was expected, comfortable and functional. gatz was attentive to my stay good. rent your room was correct and is recommended.a very clean, modern, and quiet place to stay. would stay again. convenient to civic center and north sf. right off the bart. heigo / gatz were very responsive to questions about access and living arrangements though this info is not entirely clear on the place\\'s website. there are two suites of two bunk beds and bathrooms. it works out fairly well. the looky apartment i stayed in was perfect for what i needed. it is centrally located in a new, high amenity building. it was easy to come and go as i pleased and the accommodations were clean and tidy. the apartment was not exactly as the photos imply, but it was the same look and feel. very sleek and modern. realize you may be placed on an upper bunk. this wasn\\'t a big deal but a little uncomfortable for someone 6\\'6\" as myself. if i visit sf again i would definitely stay again.gatz, welcomed me very good. gave a quick tour of the apartment and i was ready to explore san francisco. the apartment is imho very big and and has a lot of working space. it\\'s in a super location and almost everything is reachable by foot.everything from check in to check out was simply wonderful. gatz is a warm & genuine host whose attention to detail makes for the most pleasant of stays. the environment is rich with travelers from all over the world, yet the atmosphere was such that mutual respect allowed for a quiet & productive work space. i highly recommend looky home.the place was spotless and well furnished.  heigo was very welcoming and professional.  great location and accommodations for a great price.  highly recommended.had a wonderful experience. gatz gave me timely and accurate info for my arrival and did a good job acclimating me to the house. my first experience with airbnb went very well thanks to gatz.shadi\\'s place was wonderful. everything was neat and clean when i arrived. the building and her place had so many amenities that i wish i had more time to spend there and take advantage of it. the location is nice and walkable to embarcadero and most of soma. i was honored to be her first guest and she did a great job.shadi bills this place as a luxury stay and she definitely delivers. the bedroom is huge and comes with it\\'s own private bathroom. shadi was a great host- checking in every day to make sure that i had everything that i needed. the place is in a great location- short walk to the embarcadero and downtown area. i would definitely stay here again.this stay got me out of a bind after registering late for a conference at moscone center.  regular hotels were $650 a night!! the walk was not bad and it sure beats taking the bart everyday.  all in i would do it again if i had to.this was my first experience with airbnb and it was perfect.  the room was spacious and private and the bed was super comfortable.  checking in and out is simple, easy and convenient, with no hassle or run around.  if every airbnb experience is as great as this one, i\\'ll be a long time user.i had a great stay at shadi\\'s. she was very responsive and communicative leading up to my arrival. the apartment was well situated in the san francisco downtown core and financial district. the place was immaculate, modern and cozy. i had a terrific time and would definitely stay again. great apartment, location and host. thank you for welcoming my colleague!i was in a pinch to book housing at the last minute for a colleague who was visiting from out of town. shadi was very easy to work with and quick to respond to my questions. she was also honest and up front about minor renovation work being done in her building (outside the apartment). my colleague let me know that the reno\\' was not an issue at all, in fact she raved about her stay. the location was ideal: within walking distance to our office with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby.shadi was great throughout the whole process. she was very attentive and responsive when i had questions.  her place is amazing and a fantastic location. great experience. a very comfortable queen bed, good hot shower and all the necessary amenities.  my private spacious bedroom suite was elegant but homey like the rest of the upstairs.  what lovely views of san francisco—the familiar transamerica building, coit  tower, the bay bridge lit at night with ever changing displays.  how convenient: the cable car to fisherman’s wharf and union square is on this block; local bus to chinatown, embarcadero and van ness, etc. two blocks from here. uber or lyft arrive quickly in this nob hill neighborhood. \\r\\nmy hostess aina (pronounced ina) is gracious, warm and efficient; she clearly enjoys entertaining guests but is not intrusive as i need my own space. \\r\\nthe entire experience in the vip suite at aina\\'s house was impeccable. from the effortless check-in and the stellar communication, to the pastries and coffee that were waiting for me when i woke up, aina made her house feel like my home during a very stressful week. the house itself is an amazing collection of objet d\\'art and a stellar well organized library. the view from the back surprised and delighted me. i slept comfortably in the real bed, i showered comfortably in the large and comfortable private bathroom, and enjoyed the wireless internet at my disposal. if you have the good fortune of having a conversation with aina, you will quickly learn that she is clever, funny, smart, and amazingly knowledgable about a large number of fields! as amazing as her house and her hospitality were, she made it all come together effortlessly. i sincerely hope to stay here again soon, enjoy the views, and a few more conversations with my new friend :)  daniel’s place is fantastic!  the view is more amazing than the pictures if that can be believed.   my wife said, “i’m tired, i want to go to bed, but this view is too good to leave.”  you get the idea.  the views walking around the neighborhood are also beautiful.  the location is great.  we were able to walk (10 minutes) in a couple directions for world class dining. \\r\\nthere is a huge, beautiful park within 5 minutes walking distance also. \\r\\nthe home is clean.  my wife is  borderline pathological about cleanliness and daniel’s place passed her cleanliness test – one of only a few to do so after 30 years of travel.\\r\\nit is a quiet neighborhood.  it is a ten minute uber/cab to downtown or by public transportation which is only a block away.\\r\\nthe beds were comfortable….often these rentals have sub-par beds and couches, which is irritating after a day or night on the town.  daniels’ beds and couch are both a+ quality.  one of many nick-names i have for my wife is “the princess and the pea”.  she was very impressed.   she noticed that even the sheets on the beds were of very high quality.\\r\\nthe bathroom is clean and the shower is hot – one of my biggest pet peeves is when they try to save money by not giving you a hot shower!  the shower is hot.\\r\\nthe tv.   i like tv in the morning before the family gets up and i like to watch a little before going to bed.   it is 70 inches of pure hd joy.   \\r\\nthe kitchen is updated and perfect…. now we’re going to have to upgrade our kitchen…. everything works, (which isn’t always the case) in these rental properties.  they have wonderfully new washer and dryer… my wife loved them.\\r\\nthe deck.  we spent one fantastic evening on the deck with friends.   there is a heat lamp when needed.  it is 6 steps down from the apartment and has just as panoramic view as the house.\\r\\ndaniel was out of the way, but also “johnny-on-the-spot” for questions and help when needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy only caveat for this property are the stairs.  you do not have to be a world class athlete, but there are 50 steps that take you up to that view.  it is worth it, but if you have leg problems or other anything that would preclude you from mounting 50 stairs this place is probably not for you.\\r\\ni can\\'t give a good enough review about my time at dan\\'s flat in the mission.  i stayed there for a 6 day business trip with a friend/colleague from london and had an absolute blast.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe flat is truly more gorgeous than the pictures suggest.  dan was gracious enough to let me throw a small reunion party during my stay, and all of my guests were amazed with the view and quality of the furnishings.  quite honestly i think i had that conversation every time i let someone in at the gate.  \\r\\n\\r\\nit is perfectly situated near dolores park in the mission, close enough to market street to grab a bite or catch a train downtown.\\r\\nalthough i don\\'t know the area too well, the unit itself is in the center of the action, and was a perfect hub for all my friends living in san francisco.  \\r\\n\\r\\nupon arriving we immediately felt at home -- he\\'d left a bottle of champagne (which i almost thought about omitting from the review so he didn\\'t feel obligated to keep doing it), coffee w/ instructions, and snacks.    \\r\\nhe clearly cared about our experience and promptly replied to any questions we had.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe flat also has a wonderful glass shower, laundry machines with soap and fabric softener, a full-size refrigerator, and pretty much everything you\\'d want for a home away from home. \\r\\n\\r\\nnext time i\\'m in sf i\\'ll definitely contact dan before looking for anywhere else to stay.absolutely fantastic! the views are incredible....the residence is beautifully renovated and decorated. hi-end appliances and fixtures. met dan, the owner. super friendly and more than willing to assist in any way to ensure we had an enjoyable experience. additionally dan provided frequent, helpful communication prior to our stay. property is a short walk to dolores st. park which is a big plus. highly recommended. this is the place to stay!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home is beautiful, and the views are just as good as they appear in the photos.  dan has obviously invested in top-end appliances, and the main room and dining room were great for eating and relaxing to take in the superb views.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe public transport system is great, with a direct metro/tram line within 5 minutes walk which takes you straight to the ferry terminal in less than 20 minutes; where you can pick up connecting trams/buses to fisherman\\'s wharf and others.\\r\\n\\r\\ndan is a very attentive host, who contacted us in advance and during our stay to ensure that we had all we needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nall-in-all, we had a great holiday in san fran - in no small part thanks to the enjoyment we had staying in dan\\'s home.dan was very accommodating. great place!dan was extremely friendly and accommodating, couldn\\'t ask for a better host or home. thank you!!dan\\'s house is absolutely amazing.  i rented this place for my relatives who were visiting.  everything was extremely simple to check into the property as well as everything described in detail upon entering the unit.  dan communicated very well with us before the stay and made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable.  everything described in the listing is accurate and the internet is very fast as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view is incredible and i couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay in san francisco.  it\\'s very easy to get anywhere by public transportation or car.   the neighborhood is very quiet yet you\\'re steps away from a lot of action in the castro and mission or a very quick ride to downtown.  you really can\\'t go wrong with this spot and my relatives were extremely happy.  we would definitely stay here again.my colleagues had an amazing stay at dan\\'s home. they really liked the place: location was perfect for them, communication with dan was super smooth for me. everything went very well. we\\'ll try to book this place again for their next trip to sf. many thanks dan for your help! i definitely recommend it!what an amazing property! this place has one of the best views in san francisco and is within walking distance to so many cool areas. the outside porch just can\\'t be beat. our host made us feel very welcome; he communicated so well and allowed us to check in early with no problem. his home is beautiful, recently updated and extremely clean. small touches (like the cookies) were very appreciated! the beds were comfortable and the star system in the living room is super cool! all who stayed here agreed that this was one of the best vacation spots we\\'d ever been to. we really felt like we got the true san fran experience. thanks so much for such a wonderful time!we had a great welcome by dominic en little bear, even though dominic was busy, he was welcoming us with great enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\narranging everything went very smoothly, dominic responded quickly and the description of the ad was more than precise. the rooms were good and the location of the house even better.\\r\\n\\r\\nbart and muni are just a few minutes walking away, food and clubs are nearby and still you\\'re staying in a very quite neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\ntravelling towards all the major landmarks (golden gate bridge and parc, aswell as fishermans warf) takes no more than 30 - 45 minutes (on the muni).\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have recommend the house to friends (who live in richmond) so they accommodate their family when they come over.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we go back to san francisco, we would definitely consider staying at dominic and sarah\\'sdominic and his wife were very gracious hosts.  although we did not see each other much, he made sure to make us feel at home.  his house is big, roomy and lovely.  and the neighborhood is fabulous, full of places to eat and drink.  we were a family of four and we all had a great time!dominic and his wife were very welcoming. they respected our privacy but were also willing to give tips about local spots when asked. the house was quite beautiful and in a great part of the city. it was in walking distance to many great restaurants and attractions in the mission. would recommend to anyone looking for a nice quiet place to stay.dominic and sarah were perfect hosts. we stayed at their place for 2 weeks with a group of 5. they left us a lot of space, but at the same time were always there for us whenever we needed anything. they are very friendly and always happy to chat. it was a great experience to stay with them.brian was extremely nice and helpful. didn\\'t have any problems renting or during our stay.beautiful home in a nice, quiet but accessible neighborhood. great amenities. the host was very helpful with neighborhood recommendations. i would absolutely stay there again. top-notch, wonderful stay. brian was quick to reply, easy to work with, and very helpful. the giant bottle of wine waiting on the kitchen counter was also a nice touch. :)  \\r\\n\\r\\nas for the place itself, immaculately clean and comfortable. there were 3 of us, so used both beds and the pull-out couch. perfectly situated to nights in or out -- close to the mission without all the grottiness. cute, quiet street.  nothing like drinking coffee (from a nespresso machine) on the stoop in the sunshine. \\r\\n\\r\\nhonestly, no downsides. brian was a tremendous host , very accommodating. will be certain to rent again if back in sf.  jim\\'s place was great for our extended stay in san francisco – the apartment was exactly as shown in the photos, incredibly well equipped, quiet and peacful. we were there for ~6 weeks and jim looked after us incredibly well with great advice about the local area, a bi-weekly visit by an amazing cleaner and was always on hand if we needed anything. my family\\'s second airbnb experience, and again, amazing.  jim was a great host - everything very well organized for our visit and we had instantaneous support whenever we had questions.  the apartment is stunning, high quality and just as pictured (equally elegant and comfortable).  the 2-bedroom apartment interior design and decor works equally well for an adults-only visit as well as for a family.  the kitchen in particular is beautiful for anyone who appreciates cooking, and if not, you are right in between two fabulous neighborhoods for eating out - cow hollow and fillmore street.  overall location could not have been better with sophisticated dining and shopping options nearby, as well as parks, running routes, and just gorgeous houses to admire.  full san francisco experience with parking a short block + away and a ~80 step climb up to the apartment - a bit daunting on day 1, but thereafter, great exercise and makes you feel like a local!  highly recommend it!the apartment is very tastefully furnished, has excellent appliances and amenities and is located in one of the most beautiful parts of sf. close to restaurants and grocery. the only surprise was the big flight of stairs (as i was unexpectedly on crutches!) but otherwise we loved the place and would go back anytime. jim was a great host.  responsive and made us feel right at home.  the apartment was exactly as described.  clean, nicely decorated and appointed.  the location and neighborhood were perfect.  \\n\\ni will absolutely be contacting jim when i return to sf.  nick and jim\\'s apartment is exactly as described and shown in the photos. it\\'s in one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in sf! the location is very convenient to all sf attractions and lots of nearby restaurants and shops. nick and jim were both wonderful hosts and very responsive to all my inquiries. i would absolutely stay here again! beautiful home and amazing kitchen. jim and nick were fabulous! we would stay here again.this is a beautiful, impeccably-decorated apartment in a lovely, upscale neighborhood.  my family and i stayed here over memorial day weekend 2016, and we really loved it.  the building is beautiful (we loved the stairs up to the apartment, but they\\'re good to know about for anyone who isn\\'t able to climb them - about 2 flights), with a private entrance to the apartment.  the care and taste taken with the decor in the apartment is gorgeous, with two beautiful bedrooms, stunning dining room and kitchen, and two living areas (one with a tv).  we had not stayed in this part of town before, and it was very beautiful, with awesome access to the presidio.  there are some good restaurants and cafes fairly close by and the area is picturesque and walkable.  we definitely enjoyed our experience and hope to return!i made this reservation for my friend danny and he was blown away by the whole experience. excellent well maintained room and a very comfortable bed. he immensely enjoyed the hospitality of our host camilla. one of the best vacations he has ever had in a while!

has a great location within the haight-ashbury area of san francisco and just a couple of blocks from some awesome restaurants, pubs and the golden gate park.  my initial concern about the proximity of the house’s location to downtown was quickly proven false as it was quite easy to access transit and travel to all areas of the city. host camila runs a first-rate establishment and is very quick to suggest places to see and experience.   the rooms, common living areas and surrounding landscape is decorated in authentic victorian style – very lovely.  the house is clearly well loved and cared for by camila and her staff.   erwin’s room has a queen bed and ensuite bathroom with walk in shower.  at the end of a long day of sightseeing  i enjoyed sinking into the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in wireless internet access is available and use of common living areas encouraged, including the kitchen.  there are lots of little surprise extras – all very well thought out.   i recommend you consider staying at camila’s house when visiting san francisco – an awesome experience!camila was extremely friendly, helpful, accessible, and really helped set the right tone for this awesome vacation.  she accommodated my mom’s request to surprise my boyfriend and i with a chilled bottle of champagne, had great restaurant suggestions, and made it clear that we could contact her at any time if we had any questions about anything.  the erwin room itself had an extremely comfortable king-sized bed, lots of charm , and a huge bathroom with great water pressure in the shower.  we loved the location as well; we were near a cool park, great restaurants and shopping, and the parking wasn’t as horrible as it is in many other areas in sf.   the mansion, room, location, and especially camila were all great!   camila is a great host. she was very accommodating with our arrival time (driving up from la) and was very responsive with any questions and request which came up during our stay. the house is a victorian marvel in mint condition located on an excellent block. parking was also easy to find. the room faced the green courtyard so there was no street noise and my wife and i slept soundly. there were fresh cut lilly\\'s placed everywhere and the common areas as well as erwin\\'s room were always very clean. camila made sure to provide ample suggestions for our daily activities always steering us to a location she sensed we enjoined. my wife and i wold gladly stay with camila again.what a great place!  if you have the opportunity to stay here, i would not let it pass you by.  the place is truly beautiful with amazing decor.  the city is known for its classic victorians.  what better way to experience the city than staying in one of the most gorgeous ones?  the location is very desirable being  close to great coffee houses, bars, and restaurants all within a short walk.  literally right across the street from a wonderful park with picturesque views at the top of the hill.  \\r\\n\\r\\nto top it all off, camila is a wonderful hostess.  her knowledge of all the great local spots is invaluable to any guest.  add to that her friendly, welcoming nature and it\\'s hard not to feel like you\\'re with family!  san fran is a great city for food and cami has great taste as well as a passion for good food.  lucky to have some help with so many good choices around. \\r\\n\\r\\nso, if you\\'re heading to san fran, i\\'m not sure you would do better than checking out what spencer mansion has to offer.to stay in the spencer mansion was the best decision i could have made for san francisco.\\r\\nthe whole mansion and especially erwin\\'s room is just fantastic. it is the place to stay in san francisco. around haight street there are a lot of bars and restaurants, on the other side of the street is buena vista park, where you have a perfect view of the city, it is also in walking distance to golden gate park etc...\\r\\nthe house itself is incredibly beautiful. camila and her family are the best hosts you can imagine. i had such a great time that i came back for a second time. definitely the best place to stay in san francisco.\\r\\nhighly recommended!!

 our room was lovely,  and camila was a helpful and charming hostess.  spencer house is in a great location - it was easy to hop on a bus (senior fare: 75 cents) or catch a yellow cab for longer trips.  we will continue to think of spencer house as our home in san francisco.....such a fun fantasy.  janet and bill moorecamila is a wonderful host with a beautiful place. would highly recommend to any traveler coming to san francisco! our stay at the spencer mansion was beyond our w-i-l-d-e-s-t dreams! this home is absolutely magnificent! it is liking taking a journey back into time, with all the qualities of a fine victorian mansion. the furniture, the wallpaper, the rugs, the bedrooms and bathrooms, not to mention the a+ quality kitchen takes your breath away. but wait...there\\'s more! camila and her sister are the most gracious of hosts. it was like being with old friends that we have known forever. they are helpful and generous and fun! my daughter and i feel so lucky to have found camila and her fabulous mansion and we can\\'t wait to come back to the west coast to visit again. if you are fortunate enough to stay here, you will be pinching yourself to see if it is real or just a fabulous dream!\\r\\nfantastic period house. very quiet area, but still on 2 bus routes with stop outside the door. lovely lodging, gracious host. well organized yet informal. highly recommended. great place to stay.  the house and garden are gorgeously restored and impeccably maintained.  host is warm and over-the-top helpful.  looking forward to a return visit!we had another wonderful visit at spencer mansion.  camila pesce is a wonderful host -she is knowledgeable about the city and always willing to help with details about our trip and overall comfort. we will return in a few months and look forward to our san francisco/spencer mansion experience!  thank you, cami!our stay was great! the spencer mansion is beautiful, the location is fantastic, and you are right on a bus line to downtown and other parts of the city with frequent service (there was always a bus within 3 or 4 mins). cami and her sister are really lovely hosts and so generous. i definitely recommend staying here when you are in san francisco. only downside is that the bed was really warm and comfortable so it was sometimes difficult to want to leave it in a morning! san francisco is such a great city - it would be hard to improve on it - but staying at the spencer house is the best way to make it even better!  we couldn\\'t have had a nicer time at spencer house. our hosts were exceptionally lovely, hospitable and helpful and the house is lovingly refurbished and maintained. it was fun to get to know the area. we very much look forward to returning to this wonderful home.from the moment my partner and i stepped into the spencer house, we knew it was going to be a memorable experience. the house itself is astounding  and dripping with history. we caught public transport around san fran (when we weren\\'t basing ourselves in the haight) which was, for the most part, at our front door and only about a 20 minute ride away. we were in the farallon room which faced the courtyard and it was extremely comfortable and pretty quiet. \\n\\ncamila added to our experience by being warm, accommodating and extremely helpful when it came to directions and suggestions on where to visit. \\n\\nand lastly, the cats! adorable and friendly. be sure to say hi to them before you leave in the morning.exceptional place. hotel like professionalism. great hosts. this place is amazing ! victorian style, great interior, romantic room, nice host, good coffee and cookies and perfect location. highly recommended !cami and carol\\'s home is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful places i have ever stayed. and the aesthetics of the place were matched by a genuine warmth and care from cami and carol, who could not have been more perfect hosts. they put so much effort into making this the perfect stay for their guests and i hope they know how very much appreciated that is... from the gorgeous details of the house, to the provision of every single thing you could possibly want or need during (what was for me) a stay in a new city. i only hope i get the opportunity to come back before too long. thanks guys! my first time in sf for a business trip of two weeks. from the moment i started communicating with cami and carol i was delighted by the speed and genuine kindness of their responses. this went on throughout my stay. both are extremely friendly and accommodating and most of all flexible (e.g. receiving and sending packages)... the house itself is simply amazing, it looks even better in real. i am impressed with how this house has been designed and maintained. the best of all was definitely the bed. so very comfortable, i second what others said before. hard to get out in the morning. the area is great, parks, shops, restaurants... bus stop in front of door 2 buses take you straight to town. i occasionally walked to work and enjoyed the long walk very much as you get to see some of the amazing houses and typical sf streets. can\\'t wait for my next visit!!the spencer house is a true gem and everything we could have hoped for. our hosts, cami & carol, were so gracious and accommodating. true old fashioned hospitality! our room was so comfortable and well appointed, we especially enjoyed the oversized bathroom. the location couldn\\'t be more central to all the different neighborhoods we wanted to visit (presidio, pac heights, mission, hayes valley, financial district, fillmore, etc). we would certainly recommend anyone traveling to san francisco to stay at the spencer house. i was greeted at the front stoop with champagne and smiles. cami gave me a full tour of the elegant and endless home which helped orient me and stave off intimidation. the home lives up to it\\'s mansion proportions. don\\'t be daunted by it\\'s age, everything works!camila is one of my favorite hosts! she impresses me time and time again. the spencer mansion is the first place i look to book for any family, friends or coworkers staying in san francisco. it\\'s magical. thank you, cami!!!it was actually our first experience with airbnb. i used to live in the bay area and been there a thousand times...but this was the first time booking a (url hidden) our decission was airbnb. it was just wonderful  to stay at this dreamhouse on haight street. for me a dream came true cause i love victorian houses and haight ashbury. cami&carol are great hosts. everything was perfect and well-organized and safe. our room was so beautiful and magical too, very clean, very comfy bed and a huge bathroom. we would love to stay there again whenever we can. thanks so much for everything. ;-)my parents stayed in the farallon room for a long weekend and loved everything about the experience. the house was centrally located to buses and the muni train, easy walks to great restaurants, cafes and parks, and in a fun and funky part of town. the room itself was comfortable and opulent and the bathroom spacious. my parents loved having access to the kitchen -- they made coffee each morning -- and the refrigerator. it was a wonderful weekend made better by beautiful accommodations.we had a great time at spencer house. the location is perfect, the room was beautiful and so was the house. the living room was second to none and the kitchen the perfect center for afternoon wine tasting and chatting. cami and carol were the perfect hosts. if ever in sf again spencer house will be our 1,2 and 3rd choice. cami and carol are the perfect hosts. i can\\'t say enough about their beautiful home, great communication, delicious cooking, and fun loving attitude. if you can find a time when the spencer house is available definitely book it!this place is amazing!

thanks so much for some magical days in sf cami, carol & ravi! cami and carol are just the best. this was my second stay in spencer house and i honestly don\\'t have a single piece of negative feedback. i had stayed in and liked the french room before, and this time the farallon room was great. every single detail of the rooms are well-thought-out. i don\\'t know how cami takes care of check-in/check-out/room-care so professionally, yet makes this place feel like such a comfortable home for her guests. to make things even better, there was an art/photography exhibition in the house next door in the garden and i got to enjoy carol and her husband\\'s artwork. i really enjoyed hanging out with cami, carol & co. that night :)  cami then so kindly dropped me to the airport the next morning. hopefully i\\'ll be back soon for a longer stay. what an absolutely lovely bunch of people!love spencer house. i\\'m losing count of how many times i\\'ve come back to this place. cami welcomed me at very short notice and took great care of me as usual. there aren\\'t enough great things to say about cami and this house:) this time, i specifically enjoyed the location more than previous times. i keep discovering how it\\'s walking distance to a lot of places i like strolling to. excellent experience in the spencer house!we had a wonderful time in this beautiful home.  david was very helpful, easy to communicate with and a truly caring host.  lots of small details that made us feel very much at home.  excellent location, some very good local shops and restaurants that made our visit to san francisco even more enjoyable.  i would heartily recommend this classic victorian beauty to anyone wanting to savour the real san francisco.david\\'s house was perfect for us. we were in san francisco for business in the dogpatch area. the house has three perfectly laid out bedrooms with comfortable beds and very nice bathrooms. the house is filled with light and is a classic example of san francisco\\'s victorian architecture with nice outdoor space. david is a very attentive host - he met me to check in and explained everything very well. we had one very small problem and he fixed it immediately. we couldn\\'t ask for a more professional host. a great san francisco experience. david\\'s house in dogpatch is warm, charming and very well stocked. the location is perfect, too. we were just steps away from great restaurants, a winery, a couple of local watering holes and public transportation. the house itself is classic, too. i\\'d be happy to stay with david again in the future.my host was very welcoming and i loved the home we were able to stay at. the room we stayed in was the ocean view room and it was absolutely gorgeous with wide windows and an amazing view. i loved the quieter neighborhood and all of the other travelers were friendly and welcoming as well. i would definitely love to come back to this airbnb if i travel to sf again!very good housing in a perfect location.\\nkitchen is all new and well furnished. \\ni will go back if i get the opportunity.amazing property; great location, beautifully furnished & decorated, spacious,  fantastically stocked.  beth is an amazing host who went out of her way to make me and my party feel welcome.  we rented the whole property, but she dropped by to hang out (having checked with us that that was ok).  plenty of good times ensued.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe property is kitted out with all mod-cons so living there was a breeze - espresso maker? check.  wifi? check. apple airplay? check.\\r\\n\\r\\nit also has a lovely garden that is accessible if you\\'re renting the whole house - very chilled vibe there.\\r\\n\\r\\nbeth was also an excellent host in terms of local ammeties - bars, clubs, restaurants - she\\'ll point you in the right direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all i am so happy i stayed there - this was my first airbnb experience and i seriously doubt it will get any better.beth helped make our stay such a memorable part of ben\\'s make-a-wish foundation trip! she left so much fun swag for ben, picked up a cool electronics kit for him, and spent time getting to know him. she even left some of his favorite snacks in the fridge for him! what a gorgeous house, beautiful location, and kind-hearted person. 3beth and the apartment were amazing!  she really made us feel at home with a fully stocked fridge and drinks, a ride when she was available and constant communication to make sure all our needs were met.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was decorated very tastefully which made me feel right at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will be back next year and will stay again in our sfo home!this place deserves 6 out of 5 stars. beth’s home was spacious and charming, located in a very nice neighborhood in sf. \\r\\n\\r\\nbeth and mallorey were very helpful and thorough in their communication, and quick to reply. we will definitely go back!\\r\\n\\r\\noh and the zen garden is a big plus!john and sema have a wonderful apartment across the street from dolores park, which you can see right out of the front bay window in the apartment. everything was clean and comfortable and the location was perfect for exploring the city. john was extremely responsive and helpful leading up to and during our stay. we would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great vacation in san francisco!johns place is in a great location with some really good eats like delfina and birite ice cream just around the corner.\\n\\nthe apartment itself is spacious with a well equipped kitchen, sun drenched bedroom and good sized living room. \\n\\njohn himself was a lovely host. he met us at the door to explain apartment access and assisted us with taking our bags up the stairs. he was extremely responsive via text and went out of his way to come back to the apartment with a spare hair dryer. \\n\\nwould definitely recommend john and his place to any prospective sf traveller.heigo provided a unique san francisco experience. you\\'ll meet some cool world-travelers and soon-to-be locals preparing for their big move. located in a nice area, the night scene and such is just a few block walk. complex is really nice, gym and 2nd floor patio were awesome. great clean living space with a weekly cleaning service provided. not great for bringing a chick back to after a night of drinking, but that\\'s another story :-p had a blast, would stay again.heigo is incredibly nice, and the pictures don\\'t do justice to this place really. i htink he also invited some nice people in and everything was really organized. i had a package from my brother sent here and heigo was nice enough to deliver it. thank you!  i would stay here again due to heigo\\'s sheer hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is not the greatest, but the subway is a block away and very accessible.the place was very nice and in a very convenient area. however, i had to make sure that i was extremely alert walking to and from because of the transients in the area. the transients in sf will approach you and engage you if you just linger for a moment. i don’t mind staying there again, but i wouldn’t want my sister to be there. however, that can be said about a lot of places in sf. \\r\\n \\r\\nthe place itself is a 2bdrm with 8 beds and 2 bathrooms.  i didn’t realize that initially that there were 8 beds, but it’s nicer to have 2 bathrooms than just one. the people that i met there were friendly people.\\r\\n\\r\\nheigo was very responsive and professional.\\r\\nwe have stayed 3 weeks at this place and were very happy about the welcome and the continuous service.gatz was an excellent host, he made me feel like it was my home. the apartment is very nice and in a really good spot, plus it has an awesome gym. i\\'ve also had the opportunity to meet great people. it was a very positive experience!gatz is a very attentive host who would make sure you have the best experience possible in one of his looky home flats.\\r\\nthis is the perfect place to stay and meet great people from around the world, in a clean and respectful environment.\\r\\ngatz would usually come and have a chat with you every other day, and cleaning ladies come at least once a week so you can be sure everything is maintained in good condition.\\r\\nthe flat itself is big, modern and well decorated, with all amenities available as advertised. the building also features great views, an amazing gym and an outdoor terrace.\\r\\nlocation is central and super convenient, just 2 mins walk away from the civic center bart station and loads of muni lines. most neighborhood are also within walkable distance.\\r\\nthe immediate surrounding is safe, although you have to keep in mind you\\'re not far from tenderloin and its crowd of homeless people. i had nothing to complain about this though.\\r\\ni would definitely recommend this airbnb to anyone wishing to have the best san francisco experience!gatz is super friendly! luxurious apartment with nice people. stay here! gatz\\'s looky home in soma was awesome.  the apartment itself was very clean and well stocked with all new furniture and appliances.  the beds were very comfortable and every amenity i could think of was supplied.  the location is great, most of the city is within walking distance and the bart is only two blocks away.  however, the best part of the stay was the people.  gatz is a fantastic host and does more than most airbnb hosts to make sure the apartment stays clean and well-run.  he also makes an effort to ensure the community of guests is congenial.  i was at first hesitant to share a room/apartment but, i ended up having a great time with the people staying there and made some future connections.  all around a great stay, i would recommend it to anyone.this is such a great space! when i came in i was quite surprised with how luxurious the apartment was. gatz was a great host as well and very helpful. however the only minus would be the homeless that\\'s loitering around the area. gatz is a great host. the apartment is very nice, clean, etc. lots of amenities (laundry/dryer, gym, etc.). highly recommended!this was broken into two stays, but it is always a pleasure and great experience to stay at a looky home.gatz always make one feel at home and the cleanliness of the place is amazing.  i\\'ve never had issues with any of the people i\\'ve stayed with at a looky home. you will always meet fun and interesting people. if i could i would stay at any of his places anywhere i travel! simply the best.clean and modern setup. very welcoming space. all i needed was a clean and comfortable place to sleep, shower, and recharge so the bunkbed situation worked out well for me. the place is in civic center which isn\\'t the friendliest of areas at night but it is centrally located and it was easy to get around by walking, bike, or muni/bart. the amenities of the building were also really nice - i got good use of the gym and the bike room. beautiful home, great hosts! ching has a very lovely home closely located to the bart and different bus stations! she and her husband were so considerate and made our stay a great experience. they also have a very cute dog milo!\\nif you are thinking about exploring san francisco using just public transportation, don\\'t miss ching\\'s home!

:)rania was very welcoming and the room was great. i walked to their place from the bart  in the middle of a heat wave, and they kindly offered me a bottle of water. very very nice of them. the location was good, but probably need to take an uber the next time i stay, as it is a hike uphill. but that wouldn\\'t stop me from staying here again!

location great, room great, view great, most importantly the host great. thank you!we arrived at 11am to park our car in front of rania\\'s airbnb even though check-in was not until after 3pm.  when i called rania to let her know that we were leaving our car in front, she graciously invited us inside to leave our bags, even though our room was not ready.  she was helpful and kind, giving us information about the neighborhood and taking uber pool.  when we finally checked into our room we were thrilled to have a nice plush, comfy bed and very clean accommodations.  rania had towels for us, the wifi password, in-room refrigerator and a nice tv.  we never saw the people staying across the hall so sharing a bathroom was not a problem for us.  getting in and out is easy, using a combination lock and rania gave us a key to our room so we could lock it when we were out.  very comfortable, great views, and lovely hostess.  we would have appreciated an in-room coffee maker and coffee, but otherwise we enjoyed our stay very much. it was a beautiful apartment, in the charming yet raw mission district.  kitchen was immaculate and living room couches were incredibly comfortable.  modern, sleek, and clean.  the only downside was having to pay for parking in the garage a couple blocks away.phyllis was a great host, and her location was fantastic. my friends and i had a lovely time, and much of it was spent marveling at how we had found such a nice place to stay. would not hesitate to return.phyllis\\' place was great and my colleagues enjoyed their stay. phyllis was very responsive and the place worked out perfectly. fun location in the middle of the action in the mission, but located on a quiet alley so the noise is not bad. thanks!we had a wonderful experience in phyllis\\' home. the pictures don\\'t do it justice. it is a darling flat, clean, and well supplied. there was plenty of room for 4 of us. the beds were comfortable and the location was perfect. the mission is great area to walk around. the food and shops are great. we enjoyed dinner at bar tartine, beer at the monk\\'s kettle, pastries and coffee at tartine bakery, and brunch at foreign cinema. all were phenomenal. the bart is close by as well and we used it to head up to a play at the orpheum. the only downside was there was construction going on in the building next door and they were there to work at 7:30 on a saturday. noise is to be expected in the city (so i didn\\'t mind), but if you want to sleep in, bring earplugs :) there is also only street parking, but we had no trouble finding some.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again phyllis! if we are back in the city, we would love to stay again. \\r\\n\\r\\nphyllis\\'s place was great! my girlfriend and i met up with my dad and brother in san francisco for the week and had a wonderful time. the place is located only 1 block from the bart and other public transportation and seemed fairly central to get to all the places we wanted to visit. there are parts of the mission district that are still developing but a block over on valencia featured neat shops, cafes, and bars. the apartment itself was very comfortable with new everything and i would definitely go back again. we loved the place. thanks so much for a great mini vacationwe enjoyed our stay in sf at phyllis\\'s place! it is right in the heart of things but in a quiet spot. it was very clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. phyllis met us upon our arrival and made herself available for questions and was prompt and considerate. we were traveling with young kids and there was plenty of space to just hang out after trekking all over town. it is easy to get everywhere via train & bus. don\\'t miss out on mission delores park, fun for all ages and a great view of the city!we had an amazing time at phyllis\\' place. her apartment is ideally located in the center of the mission. everything was very well organized and phyllis was extremely available to answer any questions we could have. the apartment was very clean and cozy. we highly recommend it!beautiful apartment super close to the 16th/mission bart. we weren\\'t at the apartment much, but when we were, it was incredibly comfortable other than the sounds of some nearby construction during normal, daytime hours. phyllis was incredibly responsive and checked-in via email a few times during the stay.great host! phyllis was nice, attentive & accommodating throughout our planning and stay. the apartment itself is very clean and spacious and the beds were comfortable. the location in the mission couldn\\'t be better - close proximity to cool bars, the bart & blow-your-mind burritos. the only negative from our stay is the construction next door that began each day at 7:30am. phyllis was the perfect host.  she was exceptionally attentive and responsive to our questions.  also, her apartment was absolutely stunning, clean, and well kept.  the flexibility with checkin/out was easy and convenient, especially in dealing with luggage.we had a wonderful time in san fran! it was our first time using airbnb and visiting the west coast. the apartment was the perfect size for me, my 15 month old daughter and my two adults sisters.  i was traveling for a conference- only 2 stops away on the bart. her house was in the ideal location- fun neighborhood, parks, cheap delicious food. quiet street and felt very very safe. she even purchased a pack and play for us to use there. definitely would give her the highest recommendation. very kind and helpful and everything as she said. phyllis was absolutely amazing. anything we needed, she provided. the house is very well described, it was actually a little bigger and nicer than we had thought. we enjoyed the neighborhood, it\\'s very vibrant and has some really great bars and restaurants close by. transportation is good if you take bart or muni, but we mostly walked and taxied everywhere. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was our first airbnb experience and phyllis definitely made it great.the stay was amazing. the house is super clean and neat!! we loved everything. the kitchen is perfect to cook a nice meal and the bedrooms are really comfy. loved it!!!it was like awesome place.. really big but cozy. close to really good food & bars. the mexican good wow. highly recommend this place we enjoyed our stay at the apartment. it\\'s very comfortable, clean and spacious. location is great with plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. there\\'s some noise during the day time from construction next door but not noticeable from upstairs bedroom. phyllis is accommodating and very responsive. this was hands-down my best airbnb experience to date! phyllis\\' was an amazing host! the apartment is incredible - perfect location, immaculately clean, and super comfortable. this is one of the best blocks in the mission, with everything within easy walking distance (bart, restaurants, shopping, etc.). phyllis went out of her way to make sure we had what we needed. i hope to be back soon!we had a great experience with having phyllis as a host, and staying at her property for 4 days while in san francisco.  the place was easy to find, phyllis was very receptive to any questions we had - and made sure everything was set up for the five of us.  we had a ton of food options within walking distance, and the convenience of being soooo close to the bart made it that much better (although the crowd that hangs out around the station is a little sketchy). all in all it was very positive for my first airbnb experience and we loved the master bedroom and the kitchen! a fantastic flat in the funky mission area.   great bars and restaurants literally on your doorstep.   the flat has everything you could want and more.   had a marvellous time.   phyllis our host was just perfect who kept in contact without being to in your face.   would definitely recommend and would definitely go back.  thank you phyllis again for such a warm welcome.  gm&swe had a great time staying at this flat! the pictures are very accurate--great space, lots of space (which i think is rare for san francisco), and perfect for the group of us that were in town for a friend\\'s wedding. very nice furniture, appliances etc, and even a washer / dryer available in the flat. phyllis was great about leaving clear instructions about the home (how to get in with the lock box etc), and while we didn\\'t get to meet her in person, she checked in with us several times during our stay to make sure everything was going well. and she gave some good sight seeing tips, which was helpful and great! we would definitely stay here again! :)the house and location were great. very quiet for being in the heart of the mission. tons of options for food and entertainment within a couple blocks was a treat. very clean, cozy, as described. i would definitely rent this location again in the near future. your light & airy flat was perfect for our trip: 1/2 block from 16th street bart station in most interesting district in sf: mission. and now using uber we could travel quickly even beyond reach of bart for not too much $. \\r\\n\\r\\ngraffiti-art clarion alley and shopping heaven valencia st around the corner. best ethnic restaurants within walking distance.  updated kitchen had all clean equipment needed to cook fresh food from kiosks at ferry building or bi-rite, or just warm up restaurant leftovers.  lots of comfy sofa room for recovering from miles of walking the sites.  ample closet - & hangers - and shelf room for clothes.  loved the 2 boxes of sf walking and beyond sf driving card sets. very helpful!  in fact, we appreciated the box of sight-seeing guides in kitchen - and added to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nwas great to get to meet you as well and find out your compelling professional adventures behind the russian map mounted in the hallway.  hope to see you again in sf. may all your travels be as sunny and fulfilling as ours were.great place. spacious, well equipped, and clean. host is very responsive and makes the stay easy from check-in to check-out. location was great with shops and food along valencia and the bart just a block away. our recent stay in phyllis\\' beautiful flat was more than we could ask for. her flat was lovely and clean, and much larger than we expected. the space had everything we needed to feel at home. the location was perfect, with many amazing restaurants and coffee shops a minute or 2 walk away. phyllis was very helpful and communicative which made for a smooth and relaxing stay. she allowed us to drop our bags off early so we could begin to explore the city as soon as we got to town. cheers phyllis!we loved this home!  the location is fabulous, the space is just about perfect, and phyllis was very responsive when we needed anything.  the flat is in the mission, which can get loud, but the flat is at the end of a quiet street so that was not a problem for us.  the kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities were clean and modern, just what we needed after camping in yosemite.  the location is everything you could want, close to shopping and restaurants on valencia and the bart on mission, so it was easy to get anywhere we wanted to go.  the perfect place for a san francisco adventure!this place was great. very spacious and comfortable. the location is good for exploring sf and the mission has a lot to offer as well. phyllis was an excellent host.phyllis was always very easy to reach by text or phone call. the place was just as described and shown in the pictures. also it is in a great location in the mission!

and phyllis is so nice to help us solve the problem. we will recommend our friend to rent her house next time.phyllis was a great host! awesome flat in the best location. the place was clean, open and comfortable - wish we stayed there longer!fantastic place, centrally located. phyllis was a great communicator and would highly reommend staying at her place!the apartment was spacious, neat, clean and very close to the bart-transportation system. well equiped kitchen with good stocks off essentials. on the negative side, the main bedroom was exposed to street lights and noise which was somewhat disturbing. the alley leading up the the apartment was dark when arriving.the host canceled this reservation 65 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this place has it all going.  spacious quiet and right in the hart of the mission.  everything you need is right there.  a+!!i can\\'t recommend enough phyllis\\'s flat to anyone visiting san francisco. \\r\\n\\r\\ncommunication with phyllis was very easy from the first day. unfortunately she wasn\\'t there on the dates of my travel, however she kindly organised a concierge service in case we needed any help.\\r\\nshe also left loads of valuable information about the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor those flying in to san francisco, it\\'s worth noting that the flat is just 2 minutes walk from a bart station. which makes commuting around the city very easy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe flat has all the commodities one could expect/need and more. \\r\\nit\\'s located in the hear of mission, so the neighbourhood is very lively with plenty bars and restaurants, yet quiet enough to have a good rest. \\r\\nit is way bigger and more beautiful in real life than in the pictures :-)\\r\\n\\r\\ndon\\'t hesitate, just book it! :)loved the apt (roomy,spotless, quiet, close to lots of excellent restaurants etc), host was great, easy to communicate with. highly recommend! big and clean apartment on very quiet street in busy mission, probably the absolute best area to live in if you want to experience bustling san francisco. lots of small an quirky shops, restaurants, cafes etc right around the corner and a great starting point if you want to explore san francisco by foot or tram, whether you want to go west towards height / ashbury or north towards china town, union square and fishermans wharf. comfortable beds (we slept in the two downstairs), lots of wardrobe space and nice and big livingroom with some games and also guides and info about san francisco. perfect for a travelling group, we where four people. steep stairs to enter the apartment, but only one floor up. phyllis gave us very good information on our way to the trip, unfortunately we didn\\'t get to meet her and she was very hard to get hold of when we had some questions, no answer until the next day. they were not big issues and when we did have contact everything went smoothly! phyllis was a great host! communication was easy and quick. the apartment was very clean, stocked, and comfy!! i am a clean freak and it passed my inspection. lots of space for the two kids under 2 years old to play. beds were also very comfortable :) my fiancé and i ended up sleeping on the couches due to the loft being so hot (we both get hot very easy) so i can also say the couches are super comfy, ha! \\n\\nwe had three cars, two parked in the hoff st garage and one parked on the street overnight (with disability plates). no problems with the garage, very close and convenient!!  the car on the street unfortunately got broken into, thankfully only the old ripped jacket got taken. \\n\\ni would definitely recommend this space! phyllis was an amazing host! me and my group had a great trip to san francisco and were lucky to have her house as a home base. it is centrally located in the mission district, just a few short (easily walkable) blocks from the bart station in one direction and tons of great shops and restaurants in the other. there were 6 of us, but it was a very comfortable stay with 3 beds and a sleeper-sized sofa. the house itself is very clean and modern with a full kitchen, bathroom, and laundry area. i had a few questions for phyllis throughout our stay, and she always got back to me in a friendly and timely manner. the only downside is that we didn\\'t get to stay for longer! thanks again for a great visit. very spacious and sunny apartment, very clean and in great location! wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay here again. the house was incredibly clean and well maintained, the bedroom and household facilities were fantastic. it\\'s situated in very nice and safe neighbourhood, only minutes walk away from the restaurant filled geary blvd. lucie was very friendly and accomodating during our stay, would definitely recommend.room was great. lots of space and we were easily able to fit 4 people. bed was a little hard but once you actually try it, it\\'s no problem. complimentary water bottles were very appreciated as the weather was very hot.\\n\\nlocation was a little remote from town but uber with no surge pricing was only ~$12 into downtown sf. we knew this going in and chose it so we could park our car so everything worked out.\\n\\none problem was it was difficult to find the place. we had no ability to contact the host (from another country with no data or calling) but it didnt take long to work out where it was. perhaps a sign listing 1093 would help.dickson was very welcoming upon arriving.  he was very responsive each and every step of the way to accommodate my family.  the apt was described as pictured and even had bottle of waters to drink.  my family was a group of 4 and 2 children, the apt was good enough to fit everyone.  since they were mostly here for the weekend to be tourists, it was a perfect place for comfort.  thank you dickson!dickson is helpful and welcoming. the house  is so large to hold 6 people. it is not far from any places we were going to.we chose dicksons house in san francisco because it was an affordable way to stay in the city for a family of 6 persons. communication with dickson was straightforward and easy. the flat was nice, spacious and clean and well equipped. it is located near the freeway but has very nice vistas of downtown sf and the bay in the distance and you can have breakfast on the porch. it took a 20 minutes bus ride to central san francisco and we were happy with that. so we really enjoyed our time here.dickson was nice and welcoming. called him upon arrival and he greeted us and showed us to the apartment. spacious setting with a very nice view. easily accommodated 6 adults.the area was great, very close to downtown. very quiet. thank you for letting me stay there ok place, noisy and would have been better with more stuff in the kitchen if you just need a place to crash at night go for it. the balcony is shared and overlooks the freewaygeoffrey and his wife were so incredibly accommodating. we hosted an intimate sit down dinner in the gallery, and it was the perfect spot! quiet, beautiful, spacious, this is the perfect spot for a private dinner, cocktail party etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks, and we\\'ll definitely be back!great space, perfect for our small event (40 people). our guests loved it! the artwork was amazing and complimented our celebration. the neighborhood is great for entertaining before or after an event. the hosts were easily available, super welcoming and went above and beyond to serve our needs.great venue that worked ideally for the event that we laid on.  the hosts were very accommodating and proactive in their communication.  we felt very well looked after.  good parking nearby and very convenient for people coming and going to the event.  we had about 30 people at our cocktail mixer but it would have worked well for 20-40, comfortably. \\r\\nvery much recommend this to anyone looking to host a corporate or social occasion.we came upon the dryansky gallery after looking at various events spaces on other sites. one visit to the place and we were sold. \\nfrom there on, hosting our event at dryansky was an incredibly smooth experience - the place was meticulously maintained, stocked with everything you would even remotely need to put together a great show and above all quick responses to our questions. \\nif you are looking for a place to host an event for 40-50 people with a true sf flavor but without blowing your budget, this is the place. \\nthere\\'s a nice kitchen, back room, extra artsy furniture to place around, party utensils,  just about everything you may end up needing. \\nparking is a challenge in the area but we used the luxe app for that. and around 6p, you can find a spot with 10 mins of driving. \\nhats off to geoff and family for helping make our event a success!incredible room, basically had the whole house to myself the entire time. anton was a fabulous host.the host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.diane was an excellent host and when above and beyond to make me not just comfortable in her home but truly integrated into her family for the month that i stayed with her and her daughter while in san francisco for work.  her home was perfectly located within easy  walking distance to both tourist locations like fisherman\\'s wharf, ghiradelli square, embarcadero and coit tower as well as to downtown if you\\'re in town for work.  i will certainly be booking again with diane on future visits!the reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.wona\\'s house is super. we loved it and we definitely stay with her next time we\\'re in sanfran. super convenient, super comfortable and wona is a great host.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis suite far exceeded my expectations. it was wonderful to have this as our retreat during our stay in san francisco. it was so quiet and private, yet so handy to public transport, and local amenities. we really enjoyed meeting wona and staying here. this will be my first choice next time i visit san francisco.wona is a true delight and very, very sweet. we loved the place and especially loved the neighborhood. i have stayed all over san francisco and the inner sunset has so many wonderful places to eat, shop and savor. the golden gate park is a short walk away and a great place for a lazy stroll. the n judah muni line is literally at the end of the street and runs all the way into union square. \\r\\n\\r\\nif coming in on bart from sfo i suggest getting off at the powell in union square and then catching the n train to ocean beach right outside the westfield shopping center. we came in another way and had to take the bus. we found return trip to the airport far easier. it was also raining when we left and as we got out to transfer to bart there at powell ( which is right there in the mall), we had a nice cup of tea and something to eat. very civilized!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have already decided we will always try to stay in the inner sunset. it feels like a real *living* neighborhood. twin peaks is right above the house and when the fog rolls in? pure magic. \\r\\n\\r\\nfor those coming to stay in wona\\'s sweet flat i would keep these small things in mind:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. you can hear people above you pretty clearly. it can\\'t be helped and it isn\\'t overbearing.\\r\\n2. there is no shower gel for guests in the shower. just an fyi.\\r\\n3. the entertainment system is very tricky to use. ask wona for the simplified way to use it. we finally did on our last night there.\\r\\n4. there are great maps and books about san francisco left out to use. very helpful.\\r\\n5. the beds are very comfortable and it was especially nice to take a nap with the larger bedroom door open out to the patio. the bird sounds along were sublime.\\r\\n6. the keyless entry system is so easy! it\\'s fabulous once you get the swing of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nenjoy!wona\\'s apartment was in excellent condition.  we found it very easy to get to, and convenient within the city.  the apartment is in walking distance to a supermarket and various eateries.  we truly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning!great experience: no surprises, everything as described, and very straightforward instructions. perfect for a couple with two children. the house is lovely and in a quiet neighborhood and it was great to sleep there after a day in the buzz of the city. we had rented a car and it was convenient that we could park the car on the driveway. my husband likes to run and he could easily go to the park nearby. last point, this is a nice location to get to the golden gate bridge, so we went past it many times on the way back to the house.this place was very comfortable for 4 people and was exactly as described. everything is clean and well organized. wona came down to greet us and made us feel welcome. place feels very private and is close to anything you need while staying in the city. i highly recommend this great place!we enjoyed our stay at wona\\'s place. the appartment was very clean and comfortable with a lot of little attentions that makes the difference: fruits, cake, wine... the appartment ils very well located, 20 minutes far from downtown with the n train which is very close from the place. the hill just below the house offers a very nice point of view of the city and the park with his museum, japanese garden and botanical garden is very pleasent to walk throw.\\r\\ni totally recommend this place.we had a wonderful time in this apartment.  it is beautiful, newly remodeled and absolutely spotless.  wona is super organized so everything went smoothly and we had no complaints.  the apartment is 1/2 block from the n judah stop and walking distance to all the shops and restaurants on 9th and irving, as well as golden gate park.  it was a great apartment, and i would highly recommend it.  my mother came with me on this trip, and she liked it so much she plans to stay there on her next trip to san francisco!friends and i needed a place to stay in san francisco for my 40th b-day.  one suggested airbnb.com.  i was a little apprehensive at first, but this landed to be the perfect fit for our little group.  we had 2 bedrooms, and a nice big couch.  the bathroom had a beautiful shower!  the place was close to golden gate park and walking distance to many restaurants.  everything was provided for us, from linens, towels, glasses/silverware/dishes, coffee to toilet paper!  we couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay.  we did not meet the hostess, but had many conversations via text.  she was really attentive to our questions, and it felt like a place that we could call home while we were away from our real home.  we were welcomed with a bottle of wine on our table.  if we were planning a trip back, i would definitely try and book this place again!!thank you so much wona! we really enjoy to stay in her place! highly recommended! great place and great host! thx   a little slice of heaven!  wona is a wonderful host - the carrot cake was literally the icing on the cake.  this was the first time we used airbnb - a great experience.  thank you!we stayed with our 11-month son while visiting family in the area. the apartment is wonderful and wona was great-- incredibly organized and professional and very welcoming. we particularly appreciated the use of the washer/dryer and being able to borrow a pack\\'n play from wona. the kitchenette is simple but had everything we needed. the neighborhood is pretty residential but there was lots to walk to-- coffee shops, a great grocery, restaurants, etc., and it\\'s right on the muni. i would definitely stay there again.the location was great on a quiet street, but close to shops. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was clean and well looked after and a really comfortable place to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nwona was very welcoming and friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. we would certainly stay here again. this is a wonderful apartment in a great safe neighbourhood. the apartment is warm, comfortable, clean, organized and well decorated. the rooms are very large and there is even a spot for parking which is a major plus in this city! i don\\'t think we could have found a more comfortable spot as our base to see the city. easy access to public transport to visit all the major sf sites and attractions. 15 min muni ride to downtown. there are also great sites near the apartment like the breathtaking golden gate park. as well, you will find great restaurants, cafes, bakeries, and bars all within walking distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host is extremely warm, welcoming and organized. my goodness. she must have been a kaizen consultant in her previous life. she could not have made it easier. the house manual is very thorough and lets you know everything from how to use the heater to where to grab good sushi. listen to her recommendations. we tried most of them and they were all wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou can\\'t lose with this apartment. one of my best airbnb experiences to date. wona\\'s place is highly recommended. very comfortable well appointed and conveniently located just a block from transit. the suite is exactly as described and featured in the pictures and very comfortable for 4 people (we had a couple and 2 singles). wona is a wonderful host, we had a very organized check in experience  and she has  great restaurant recommendations! thanks wona!wona was a fabulous host who not only provided us with a great place to stay, but also loaned us her stroller and kids toys without hesitation. we greatly appreciated her organization and friendliness. location and setting can\\'t be beat. wona miniati\\'s home was excellent; very clean, organized and designed much better than many professionally designed hotel rooms. \\r\\nshe paid attention to all details to make the guests feel comfortable.\\r\\nthis home is in a nice neighborhood, walking distance to local restaurants, cafe\\'s, park and public transportation. \\r\\nwe enjoyed very much our stay at wona\\'s home and definitely plan to come back.my boyfriend brian and i felt like we had a home away from home staying at wona\\'s! in addition to the clear directions to her place and instructions for parking and entering the building she sent prior to our arrival, once there we were greeted by a bottle of wine and a house manual to answer any questions we may have had. wona was available by phone and also introduced herself in person - she\\'s a very friendly and accomodating host. the apartment itself was very clean, orderly, and comfortable, as well as bright and cheery. it\\'s located conveniently near public transportation on a quiet, residential street but with easy access to the beach, golden gate park, a grocery store, and restaurants. brian and i both loved coming back to relax there after each jam-packed day of adventures. we would recommend it to anyone and would love to stay there again on our next visit!the space and location couldn\\'t be better. this \"in-law suite\" is nicely decorated and clean, and just steps from the n judah train. there are also lots of restaurants and a grocery store in walking distance. the host, wona, is very nice and responsive. she had a pack n play crib as promised for our 19 month old. she also allowed us to park in her driveway, which saved us a bundle over hotel parking. one word of note that is the first level of a family\\'s home, so you do hear some foot steps just like you would expect to hear in your own home. there is a private entrance and key, and even laundry to use for free. there is not a stove, but a microwave, \"dorm fridge,\" keurig with coffee pods, and all the dishes you could need. also shampoo and a hairdryer in the bathroom. overall a great space in a very safe and convenient neighborhood.we had a wonderful time. the apartment was exceptionally clean and spacious. the kitchenette had a keurig coffee maker, toaster, hot plate, microwave and small fridge. it was good to save the money and have breakfast there. the beds were very comfortable with nice linens. the neighborhood is great and it is easy to walk to shopping and a very fancy grocery store. arizmendi is one of the best bakeries we have tried (the bialys, although not traditional, were the best we\\'ve had). wona and her family were super nice and gave us very yummy banana bread they baked and a bottle of wine. we highly recommend wona\\'s place. thank you wona!this place was everything we needed and more!  this was my first time really traveling with our 6-month old daughter and the space was perfect for her.  we didn\\'t need a full kitchen, just enough to wash bottles and heat up baby food.  the location was wonderful and i went for a jog in golden gate park, jumped in the n-judah train to the ballpark and caught the bus a couple of blocks away to crissy field.  it was a much nicer place for me to come home to than a hotel room, now that my evenings end at 7pm.  i put the baby to bed and could just relax on the comfy couch.  it is a great addition that there was parking (so essential in the city), unfortunately we brought along our large truck and so we couldn\\'t fit in the city sized driveway and still leave room for another car.  street parking was not too bad to find, however.  we didn\\'t get to meet, but wona was a wonderful host through the phone and e-mail and i am looking forward to a return to this place someday.  thank you again for everything!wona was completely hospitable and welcoming. a great way to land in san francisco. terrific coffee beans and wine left there for our arrival…i booked this for 5 employees. here is what they said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"super nice house!

 her home is spectacular and exactly as described and shown.  her communication was xlnt and went above and beyond to make our stay with clients memorable.  we event received a \"weather heads up\" because sfo was warmer than normal which was absolutely perfect.  this was my 1st airbnb experience and it was phenomenal.   we would stay at wona\\'s again.  the wine and chocolate on arrival was special and i so appreciated the  \"welcome call\" live when we arrived.  beyond ritz carlton, white glove service.  beautiful home and grateful for the experience.  thanks wona!the house worked very well for our family wedding. lots of space. sons was always responsive when i contacted her with questions. great experience to live in wona\\'s place. the house is super clean and functional. location is great and it also has a quiet neighborhood. all the people like and enjoyed staying the house and we had a great experience in san francisco.house was great. location nice. perfect for families. would come back wona and her beautiful home are absolutely fabulous!

 the apartment suite fulfilled all of our expectations and was \"as advertised.\"  we occupied all of the beds - including the inflated mattress - and were completely comfortable during our stay.  the place was well equipped, including the kitchen.  since we made great use of public transportation for our group using 7-day passes, we were grateful to have the j-church at our doorstep, especially when we learned that it would stop on demand in front of the apartment at 27th street - and within the apartment, noise from the j-church light rail was faint since most of the sleeping areas are away from the street.  the neighborhood was great with some good eating and convenience-shopping nearby.  all in all, we were completely satisfied with this, our first experience with airbnb.check in was smooth and teresa was really helpful in making sure that we had all the info we needed to arrive. the house is in a great area, with plenty of things to do and see nearby. teresa has been a great host. always available for questions and willing to assist. house is spacious, clean and close public transportation.  i am very happy with this reservation. thank you teresa very much! we will come back for sure!the space was very comfortable, clean, and perfect for our needs (2 families 10 people for long sf weekend).  the location was great and the convenience of having the muni train right out the front door invaluable and great food close by.  teresa was helpful and prompt in communicating with us.  we would recommend staying here to others and hope to be back.the bedroom space worked really well for our group of 3 adults and 3 children.  all reported beds were comfortable and showers worked well - our primary criteria!  we loved the location; good local amenities and public transport and only a short hop to the 24th st. restaurants/shops , which we used a lot.  location on a flat sf street is also a plus for getting around and parking.  our car was too big to risk the garage but we were moving around a lot so the weekday street parking restriction (2 hours) did not impact us.  the garage would be great for a standard car (though with uber/cabs and public transport no car is required).  the property is prepared for rental, equipped appropriately and had everything we needed.\\r\\ncommunication with teresa was a breeze, she was quick to respond, provided clear instructions and checked up on us.\\r\\nwe enjoyed our stay and would stay again.we are a family of 4 with young children 3 & 6.  we loved the location in noe valley for it\\'s rapid access to downtown, but also with a very nice and safe neighborhood feel.  we loved jumping right on the j-church muni line to go visit sites all over downtown and beyond.  it was really great being able to run across the street and tell the family when the next muni was coming (since the sign quite accurately tells you) and therefore plan when we made our exit.  there is also a nearby whole foods (~10 blocks away) and safeway (more of a short 3 minute drive)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was beautiful and well kept up.  the pictures are exactly as they appear.  the house was well laid out for nice conversation at the front of the house without disturbing sleepers in the back of the house.  the house is also great because there is a quiet business downstairs and it is only two stories. as such, there was virtually no noise from neighbors and no concern about disturbing neighbors when the kids ran wild up and down the halls.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe j-church muni, for all it\\'s convenience is fairly loud when it comes by, but it stops running around 10pm-5am or much less frequently and when we used our noise machines (which our family is addicted to), even the kids in the front bedroom (nearest the muni) slept very well.  it didn\\'t even wake us in the morning.  \\r\\n\\r\\nteresa was available, but not intrusive and left us a lovely bottle of red wine.  we were grateful for her sharing such a lovely, nicely stocked house for us to use on our visit.  100% better than a hotel would have been.   (pillows, utensils, wine glasses, blankets, soap, dish soap, sponges, laundry detergent, etc.).  thanks again for such a nice stayme and my colleagues had a lovely stay in teresa\\'s place. it was the perfect location and was very comfortable. would recommend!the space was great and in an awesome location. bedrooms clean and spacious, kitchen well equipped and was perfect for what we needed. a minor plumping problem with the dishwasher was promptly fixed and communication was good.it was a great experience living in this house, very cosy, clean and convenient.we had a fabulous experience here! so convenient to transit. coffee shop just down street. would highly recommend staying at! we stayed at theresa\\'s house for 5 nights for a business conference. it was clean and comfortable for the four of us to stay in. while we didn\\'t cook, it had a modern kitchen with cookware and even spices readily available. we only had two issues, one being the wifi not working and two being the ants.  however,  we did not try to reset the router or contact theresa about the wifi, so it could have been an easy fix. also, there are signs warning about noe valley being infamous for ants. once we took out the trash, it wasn\\'t really an issue. overall, it was a pleasant stay and i would recommend it to others. thanks,  theresa!we are very satisfied.\\r\\nthis flat is very clean and spacious. \\r\\nand teresa cares about us always.\\r\\nwould book again.  my coworkers had a very comfortable stay.  teresa is a great host, she has everything setup on autopilot. the property was great, very clean and organized. great for a family vacation in the city or a group of colleagues. extremely well located, the j line literally stops at the door. the apartment was really clean and neat. great stay.we had a great time at this beautiful home!teresa was a fantastic host. checking into the apartment was a breeze and she was very helpful and accommodating. the apartment itself was lovely (look just as it did in the pictures), was in a great part of the city, had tons of space, was very clean, and was very conveniently located (public transportation was so easy). we had a great time in sf and teresa\\'s apartment had much to do with that. she\\'s also very quick to reply to messages and very easy to get in touch with. i would definitely recommend choosing her listing. wonderful space. traveled with a work group and it suited us very well. awesome space and i would definitely recommend it!melissa was incredibly accommodating.  the space was clean and much more comfortable that other reviews had us expect.  all four of our group slept wonderfully in our own spaces, even unexpectedly with sheets that had thread counts higher than most hotels.  in addition to the ease of access and ample storage space for luggage or leftovers, the location is also a gem in and of itself.  the house is in a neighborhood directly south of golden gate park and east by a twenty minute or so walk to the beach.  it is removed enough to feel safe and sleep quietly, yet close enough to walk to bars and restaurants.  i look forward to staying again the next time i\\'m in san fran.very much enjoyed my stay in the loft. great location and great place. fully equipped with everything you need to cook a nice meal and serve many. billy was also very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. would definitely recommend.i hosted my bachelor party at billy\\'s sweet entrepreneur loft located in soma. the space was perfect for me and my friends, as it accommodated us perfectly for everything we wanted to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nfor example, the first night we wanted to stay in drink, eat and play poker. his awesome kitchen is connected to the common area, so we were able to cook, eat and talk all in the same area. also, he\\'s got speakers wired throughout the whole house - so all we had to do was plug in a laptop and we were set. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe second night we went out, which was super easy since his place is in a great location. there were a bunch of awesome bars and restaurants all within a mile. and, for the few hours we did sleep, he has really nice couches and inflatable mattresses that can accommodate up to 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all this was a 10 out of 10 experience. billy was super welcoming, and available over text if we wanted recommendations. he even called at one point to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and asked if we needed anything. his space is perfect for just about anything. you\\'d be silly if you didn\\'t passed up an opportunity to book this sweet spot. epic girls night at billy\\'s place, it was so much fun!  thank you billy for hosting us.  we enjoyed the roof deck respectfully, loved your loft - it worked out great, and we also had a lot of fun with your gigantic message board.\\r\\ni would recommend billy\\'s place to anyone considering for hosting a gathering for work or play or both!\\r\\nbilly\\'s place was so great! he had everything we needed and made it very easy t check in and out. perfect for the company offsite we hosted!really great space in a fantastic part of town. we weren\\'t mis-led in any way but we hadn\\'t fully understood that there are no dedicated and private sleeping quarters. that being said there are plenty of sleeping solutions so it wasn\\'t a problem in the end. in fact, the space was perfect for what we wanted. \\r\\nin addition to this billy and his team were incredibly helpful on our day of departure - due to an incident involving parking and our rental car we needed some extra support getting us and our luggage to the airport and billy\\'s in-house team were brilliant. thanks so much for everything. billy was awesome and very flexible in adjusting to our plans and being an ultimate host.  the place was immaculate, beautiful, perfect for working from home, and in a very central location.  i\\'d recommend staying with billy!the space was perfect for our sales meeting.  having the opportunity to bring our team together in an informal environment with great natural light and all the neccessities for productive interactive discussions, was great.  we were also able to take full advantage of the open chefs kitchen, as the team helped prepare dinner together at the end of the meeting.  billy was extremely helpful and accommodating with our ever changing needs.  my only recommendation is don\\'t park your car on the street at night - use a private lot.  \\r\\n\\r\\nwe will be back.billy\\'s loft is awesome! it was the perfect spot for our work offsite. highly recommend! first off, like the other posters said, billy was an awesome host.  nothing like showing up late after a long flight,\\r\\nand being handed a cold beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe used the loft as a location for a photo shoot, i actually slept upstairs, and was super comfortable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nplace is totally plug and play, great audio system, and most importantly, amazing light, even on a cloudy day. \\r\\n\\r\\nall the furniture is easy to move around too, billy encourages you to make the place your own, and is always available if you need something.\\r\\n\\r\\nlocation is ideal as well. anything you could possibly want is within walking distance. shop, restaurants, bars, etc...\\r\\n\\r\\nyou won\\'t be !\\r\\nbilly was a great host. very responsive and his place was great. would definitely recommend. we rented billy\\'s place for an off-site meeting. his loft was perfect for our meeting and we really enjoyed the giant white board. the loft is really well situated-  near food trucks during the day (yum!) and a whole foods. also, it was very convenient for me to come from the airport since its near the bart station. billy was super helpful with check-in and very easy to communicate with. thanks again!billy and his loft were wonderful!

let\\'s just say that if he was selling the place that i would make an offer!! greg was super helpful and very accommodating to our needs. he even pointed out a few areas to check out. thanks so much greg!wonderful house in a quiet & yet completely central location... greg was very helpful & accommodating... we loved our stay in his house, & would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a stylish home to relax in after days of seeing the sights... thanks again.very nice house!fantastic house, great location, awesome city.   we\\'re grateful that greg opened his home to our family.\\r\\nvery nice home, easy to find, and was clean and ready for us.  greg was super accommodating with our check-in and check-out time.  other than maybe a couple more towels, pillows, and a few more rolls of tp, we were not without anything.  i\\'d highly recommend this spot and will stay here again with my group in a heartbeat.beautiful, comfortable, great location. i will stay here every time i visit sf from now on. wonderful place. you can tell greg has an appreciation for good design and aesthetics.  greg\\'s art collection sparked plenty of conversation. his home is more beautiful than the pictures can allow.  the seating  was plush and comfortable and he had gorgeous throws everywhere to warm up and snuggle by the fireplace. the kitchen had everything but a blender. the sheets were luxurious and beds sumptuous. everything was clean and smelled great.\\r\\nwe loved the location.  my husband and i came to sf for an extended weekend and wanted to have space if our kids (ages 21 and 22) wanted to visit.  our daughter commuted in from berkeley easily and our son drove up from la. we were able to host them overnight and have long leisurely breakfasts and invite friends over for drinks before going out for dinner.  we had a garage parking space and street parking was not a problem. it was so easy to walk to restaurants, coffee shops and the grocery store.  we walked into the mission and used the bart to get to the east bay.\\r\\nhaving greg\\'s house made this trip to sf one of our favorites yet.fantastic place on a quiet street in the casto. quality, modern finishes and three bedrooms made it the perfect place for us.this house is a real beauty.  it is everything we expected and more.  greg was vey easy to deal with.  the location is ideal.  i would stay here anytime i am in san francisco.it was my first experience with airbnb and i\\'m amazed. i am sure that i will not always be so lucky, as with greg’s house, but it\\'s the best place i’ve ever stayed in san francisco (i’ve stayed in various, very nice hotels). it is unclear how, after such a wonderful home, you can choose a hotel again. do not hesitate, it is best that you can find.\\r\\nthank you, greg!we had a wonderful stay at greg\\'s home. the location was convenient. greta restaurants and supermarket within walking distance.  also easy to get to other parts of san francisco. we will recommend to friends and will visit again.\\r\\ngreat stay in a beautiful house well located in the castro. very convenient garage and all amenities. \\nthe house is beautifully furnished and decoratedgreg communicated effectively with us. there were nice touches like beer in the fridge and nice soap in the bathrooms. the house was very intuitive as greg said and we had no problem finding out how to make things work. beautiful house and really accessible location. the house is very spacious and has high quality furnishings and comfortable beds. easy to transport from just down the road and the garage is a must if you have a car. \\r\\nwe did have two kids with us and the endless stairs were a little terrifying, but that is san francisco. and the beautiful furniture keep us on edge with little kids and potential filthy hands as well, but that is also to be expected. \\r\\nso, a lovely house and experience, but if you have kids under 4 or so just keep it in mind that you won\\'t be able to take full advantage of the opportunity to fully relax and enjoy. \\r\\nthere is a little yard out the back, which is great for them though, and the bed in the front room is a queen and on the floor, so was perfect for them to not fall out fromclean, modern, and spacious. amazing house, on a very quiet street just a 5 min. walk from castro street. \\n\\ngreg was always very helpful and quick to respond. everything in this house is just great - from decoration to the little backyard/patio. we stayed two families with small kids for a week - the three floor layout worked really well for us. we would be happy to recommend this place to anyone!such a gorgeous space! greg always communicated with us quickly and was great with follow up.  we\\'d stay here again and definitely recommend. thanks greg!this is a lovely, clean, contemporary home in a fantastic location - quiet street within easy walk to the castro. the living space is configured differently than the pics - now has round dining table en lieu of one of the sofa/easy chair configurations. that\\'s better for dining - less ideal for large group socializing. the open staircase with no handrail could be a bit tricky for older guests or children. the outdoor space is very aesthetically pleasing, but not very functional.  having a garage is a huge plus - although a nissan pathfinder was a tight fit. we would definitely stay here again. greg was very easy to deal with.my family had a great time at greg\\'s place over the thanksgiving weekend.  the accommodations were outstanding and greg quickly responded to all questions that came up.  i highly recommend his place for anyone looking to stay in sf!the location was excellent... quiet and tucked away while still fairly close to castro station. the place was nicely furnished and overall the photographs capture it. attention to a few more details would have made it perfect, but overall we enjoyed our stay.a beautiful house in a great neighborhood.  greg was a gracious host and made our stay a very pleasant one!   a beautiful home in a quiet street in a great neighbourhood. \\r\\ngreg was always very easy and friendly to deal with, and he was particularly accommodating with some last minute changes and requests we had.\\r\\nit is a lovely property and we highly \\r\\nrecomend it.beautiful home and a fantastic location. lots of great restaurants and shops within walking distant. the neighborhood feels nice, safe, and quiet. i\\'d love to stay there again.greg\\'s home is awesome! the space is huge, well decored, in a very safe and quiet neighbourhood 5 mins walking to castro station. we stayed for 10 days and we really felt like home, there\\'s a nice garden and the beds are very comfortable. definitely recommended!  the place was great. very clean and lovely home. greg was responsive when we needed him but otherwise left us alone, which was perfect.beautiful home and perfect host! favorite place in sf. i\\'ve stayed here a number of times now. it\\'s a beautiful home in a great location.the host canceled this reservation 88 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.greg\\'s place was absolutely gorgeous. very spacious, fully upgraded and remodeled. being in sf in such a modern home is truly unheard of. house had everything we needed and we enjoyed our stay very much. gorgeous house, in a fun neighborhood. the owner was accessible as needed and very kind. i would definitely stay here again!the host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this house is great.  it\\'s in a perfect location for to leverage public transportation to see everything you want to in san francisco.  it was warm when we were in town, but all we had to do was open the windows and it was really comfortable.  the house itself is clean and well kept.  i sent greg a couple questions and he was very responsive.  overall, recommended.in 3 words - clean, beautiful and perfectly located!\\r\\nwe were a group of 6 people at the house, some of our group landed prior to the check-in time and the house wasn\\'t ready until 4pm. greg, the owner, had several suggestion to help us with our luggage during the day and was happy to answer any question.\\r\\nthe house itself is gorgeous, although it was a bit different from the photos we loved the design. it is also very spacious, tons of storage place for all our luggage, if you\\'d like to feel at home, just unpack and put everything in the closet, we did. furthermore, the bathrooms were very luxurious, the beds were extremely comfortable and came with premium beddings, the garage was very useful for the rental car and included a washer and dryer and the kitchen was absolutely beautiful and came equipped with everything you need to prepare a meal and eat in.\\r\\nthe house came with basic instructions (how to get in, check in and out times, cleaning, etc.) this manual didn\\'t include instructions to the appliances, however we figured out how to operate everything except for the oven (which we didn\\'t need and i\\'m sure that if it was critical to us, a quick call to greg and we would\\'ve managed that too). the a.c. in the house is inactive although we didn\\'t really need it at the time of our visit as the weather was perfect.\\r\\nand of course, the location, minutes from the castro, market st. (all the main public transportation lines), the mission, tons of shopping, restaurants, bars and cafes. \\r\\nin conclusion, this house is clean, spacious, equipped, homey, comfortable, and the owner is very nice and cooperative, and that\\'s much more than you can ask for in a vacation rental, and still fairly cheaper and much more comfortable than a hotel. \\r\\nwe had the best time, \\r\\ntom, ran, karin, noa, shiry & shlomiwe had a great stay at greg\\'s gorgeous, comfortable and luxurious house. conveniently located in the castro and just a  5 minute walk from muni, cafes and restaurants, we could not have asked for a better home away from home for our business trip. thanks for having us, greg!the house was so clean and neat and easy to use. the beds were very very comfortable and we all slept so well! we loved the neighborhood and we so happy to be walking distance to so many coffee shops, restaurants and a great grocery store. as someone said in another review, the house is much nicer then the pictures show. it truly was a pleasure staying there and felt like such a vacation! greg\\'s place has very good location. there are a lot of restaurants and groceries nearby. the place is clean, beds are comfortable and kitchen is complete. but our car didn\\'t fit in the parking since it has a rack on top but there\\'s always a vacant parking space outside so it wasn\\'t a problem. internet is fast too!

thanks luise very much for providing my family and i such a warm and nice house to stay in sf. she is always helpful and kind. my family and i spent a very good time even my family don\\'t speak english. she gave us useful road directions and help us to solve several problems i occurred during my vacation since i am foreigner.  i love her, her house and her story. i hope next time i will have more time to stay there. and luise, always welcome to beijing and inner mongolia. my family and i very welcome you! :)luise was great host, her house was clean and comfortable, she cook us good breakfast and we had a good chat, if we revisit sf, we will definitely stay here again. fantastic host and guide. highly recommended. \\r\\n\\r\\nluise was incredibly welcoming and friendly; her house was a home away from home. all our questions were answered and luise gave us all sorts of advice, information and help. a lovely, relaxing trip to san francisco made all-the-better by good conversation. luise custer is a lovely and accomodating person.\\r\\non the whole, we were satisfied with our stay. \\r\\nthe sitting room was cozy, bedrooms modest and clean.\\r\\nthe view of san francisco from her bedroom is great. \\r\\nwe did not spend much time there, as our extended family lived down the road, but aside from a bowl of bananas and apples, there was no food for breakfast, no bread, no eggs, no coffee......\\r\\na b&b with just bed... no breakfast. \\r\\ni\\'m sure luise was not aware of this, as she herself was traveling.\\r\\nvery sincerely,\\r\\nlise and werner pfeiffer luise is a really very nice host and her home is very pretty with good view at twin peak.  all my family love her very much, especially my 4-years old son. he asked me several times when will saty at luise\\' s home  next time after we leaving.  we really hope to stay with luise next time at sf. thanks for luise\\'s well-preparing and sharing with her story,  and also thanks for delia\\'s kind help. highly recommend.my familly and i had a really good time there. the house is nice and clean. the location is great which only took us 15mins to both sfo airport and the city center. the most important thing is that liuse is such a good and warm host. even though we didn\\'t spent lots of time there, we still had a really nice talk and my family felt like home. luise is very friendly, considerate and willing to help. we love the place and luise. i think it would be a great experience for everyone who stays there with luise. highly recommand!\\r\\n\\r\\nmengyuanluise was a great host to our party of 5. she was very welcoming and her place was amazing! we loved having full access of the kitchen, it made our stay much easier. i would def recommend staying here. luise is full of stories and wonderful company over breakfast :) she is very accommodating and was easy to communicate with. her place is a charming location to stay in while your explore sf!the first thing we noticed about luise was that she made us feel at home right away. the place was well kept and we could access most areas of her home. there were 5 of us and our stay was very comfortable. two queen beds and a single in separate rooms were more than adequate. she provided amenities and we had access to breakfast. parking was always available in front of her exquisite home, which has a beautiful decor and fine furniture. from the back of her home is a good view of the city. the neighborhood is calm and upper class. the home\\'s proximity to many tourist sites is a boon. we would definitely recommend luise\\'s bungalow. luise was very welcoming to all of us. staying with her was a real pleasure, her place got an amazing view over the bay, and the rooms are really nice.in luises bungalow me and my family (5 people) felt being welcome from the very first minute. we were greeted with drinks after a long journey. after this warm welcome, we were shown our clean and comfortable rooms. each of them had a great view over parts of san francisco which was an absolute plus! the neighborhood is safe and quiet. additionaly, it is not too difficult to get to downtown sf. probably the best way is to combine a nearby bus with the metro that takes you to many central tourist spots. if you like to travel by car or want to leave your car there (as we did) you will have no trouble to find a parking spot near the house. enough said about the house and the neighborhood. something i would really like to mention here is that luise is a really nice and intelligent person that took care of us from the first minute and was nice to chat with about anything. thank you luise for making this a wonderful experience for me and my family. i would love to visit you again! best, christianluise was like a mom for us! friendly, welcoming... i would love to visit her again. she made breackfast for me and my friends everyday. thank you for everything luise!the house is beautiful and is a typical style of san francisco. the location of the house is good. it took us about.30mins drive to  downtown.we stayed comfortable .louise is  a very nice and warm host. we wish we could stay here longer.i would highly recommend to book her amazing house, everything is exactly as she described and even better. luise is a super host! she is responsive, very nice and understanding. our stay here was very pleasant with great view and welcoming feeling, will defiantly come back. thank you so much, it was very great memory for the girls. luise is a gentle, loving, caring hostess. her house shows her generous character and her attention to detail. it was a wonderful place to rent and i would certainly recommend it and her to everyone.ashot\\'s place was a small oasis looking over the rooftops of soma in san francisco. the room was large and light filled, the bed was comfy and the bathroom and adjoining living / kitchen areas were huge! thanks ashot for having me to stay.the place is awesome!!!ashot\\'s place was great:  good views of the city and very comfortable.  he was also very helpful in answering our questions.  thanks!really cool place with great views over the city. ashot and his fiancee were super helpful. highly recommended to the airbnb community.working trip at moscone so location was close enough to walk in each day. amazing space to be in for downtown $f with views of street art surrounding you! ashot was real cool & down to earth host that had some low key spot suggestions to check out there, which ended up being really good!the bedroom and private bath had everything i needed and the apartment and views were great. i especially appreciated the separate entrance right by my room. ashot was very responsive and not at all intrusive. i was able to book this room last minute and it saved my trip!great place with a nice vibe. lots of privacy including your own entrance, which was a nice touch. unfortunately i didn\\'t get to see much of ashot as i was out lots, but he was pretty cool and gave me lots of space. the place was fantastic - roomy, well-furnished, fresh, and extremely comfortable.  ashot was tremendously helpful and responsive from the time of booking through arrival and stay.  the loft was reasonably priced and walking distance to union square and other attractions.  the loft was close to the bart line that we took from the airport and had a secure entry downstairs. the upstairs private entrance as well added to specialness of the rental. the bedroom was comfortable, had a view of soma, and was a quiet place to rest at the end of a day of walking around the city. i think what i\\'ve noticed about sf airbnb listings is they won\\'t say what floor the flat is on, which isn\\'t a problem but it\\'d be helpful. this listing was on the third floor. a nice spacious room with private entrance.  loft was beautifully decorated and luna the doggy was super sweet.  really nice coffee shop in close proximity recommended by the host.  room was a bit hot at times as there was no air conditioning but i was told that it was unusually hot in sf while i was there.  also, there are quite a few flights of stairs to drag your luggage so be prepared for that if you have a lot of (url hidden) net, great stay, recommended!  it was perfect in all aspects... rachel and ashot were very welcoming and suggested great places for me to go to that did not disappoint. would definitely book again when i go back to sf.the loft was beautifully appointed and very clean. both beds in the room were queens and were comfortable, and i didn\\'t notice any noise from the street (actually, i was woken by birds chirping). the neighborhood (around 7th and mission) felt safe to me, although with some homeless loitering at night i can see how some would consider this part of soma slightly sketchy. ashot wasn\\'t there but rachel was helpful in meeting me when i arrived (late) and giving me the rundown of the place. she even bought me a cup of coffee at sightglass, a fantastic coffee roaster just around the corner!\\r\\n\\r\\nhonestly my only complaint is that the huge skylight over the bed let in so much light that i was woken up at 6am and it was hard to get back to sleep. if you don\\'t want that to happen to you, i strongly suggest sleeping in the other bed, which doesn\\'t get nearly as much natural light.wonderful soma loft in a good location.  our hosts were welcoming and my friend and i really enjoyed our stay.ashot\\'s loft and room are really cool! it\\'s in soma and close to bart/muni for making your way around the city. very welcoming host. he took me to the batting cages and out for mexican food at a local restaurant. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would recommend francisco to any airbnber.ryan was a great host.  he made my first booking experience incredibly easy and he was very responsive to my inquiries and requests.  he also provided travel tips and maps to help me enjoy my trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe property has a great view from the turret windows.  it is located within walking distance of lots of restaurants and shops in haight-ashbury and on divisadero which made getting around very easy.  the 2 bed 1 bath private room was very clean and well decorated.  the beds are comfortable and the windows provide lots of fresh air.  the room is also very spacious, easily accommodating our three guests.we ended up staying an additional night at ryan\\'s place as we liked it so much! great room in a nice neighbourhood, really easy to get about the city and explore. really close to golden gate park and divisadero st, so you have good outdoor space and good food / drinks on the doorstep. \\n\\nryan was really friendly and easy to communicate with, gave us a good knowledge of the city and what to check out. even walked us down to show us places to eat on our first night. \\n\\nwould definitely stay with ryan again and would recommend to anyone visiting sf. everything is perfect.the pity is that we can\\'t live here more days.ryan was an excellent host, easy to communicate with and understanding when we were running quite late for our check in time. the space was clean and the beds comfy. the location was perfect, just a few blocks from haight-ashbury and golden gate park. definitely recommend this listing, thanks ryan!ryan was a great host. everything went smoothly and we had a great time.ryan was very helpful and welcoming. the room was incredibly spacious and clean with nice view and the location was perfect for discovering the city.ryan is very friendly with good hospitality.\\nthe old building in residential area that you can feel like home. the room is new renovation very clean and nice in the good condition and good location. we enjoy the place and surrounding that very convenient to find good food. if you have car it is many free car parking around the building.\\nryan\\'s place was beautiful and true to photos. the bedroom was very spacious with beautiful light. beds were super comfy with memory foam mattresses and very nice, practically new bedding. shower was luxurious deluge of rain style head. everything was immaculately clean. the kitchen was a great place to hang out around the giant wooden table and dishes were readily available. the only downside to the place itself was the four flights of stairs to climb, but that also meant the views were good. oh and tasty pie place across the street ad tons of walkable restaurants and bars. ryan was very accommodating and great at communicating. we left our daughters sunglasses behind and he alerted us very quickly so they could be retrieved. room was just as described, lovely! ryan was a fantastic host! extremely friendly and accommodating. the apartment was clean, beautiful, and exactly as described. we will definitely be staying with ryan again if we find ourselves back in the area!the room is indeed massive as described. was perfect for what we needed. comfy beds and great view!ryan was a very friendly and gracious host. very helpful with suggestions about the city. the room and apartment are great -- lots of space, very clean, wonderful kitchen, great views of the city too. the area is nice because it\\'s not in the manic, crowded center of the city -- it\\'s a peaceful residential area that\\'s easily accessible to restaurants, bars, stores and public transport. probably a \\'real\\' experience for someone looking to be un-touristy. ryan was a gracious and accommodating host. the bathroom in the guest bedroom was being fixed, and instead of canceling our reservation, he offered to have us stay in his room and living area. ryan\\'s apartment has lots of character, and is in a super cute neighborhood with easy access to restaurants, bars, grocery/drug store, etc. ryan\\'s apartment is beautiful with lot of sunshine. the location is great, very close to bars and restaurants and muni stop is right around the corner. ryan is an excellent host!

he was very attentive and helpful! i and my family would love to have ryan as a host again!!we had a great stay here, although we didn\\'t meet ryan much but he\\'s very nice and the apartment is great too with a nice location and big space room. ryan was a lovely host. he made you feel instantly welcome and is happy to answer any questions you might have about moving into the san francisco area, which was quite refreshing considering that other people could be reluctant to discuss such things. but ryan is a very warm individual and a delight to talk to. the neighborhood that the room is located in is very picturesque and quiet, yet you can easily reach the bart or walk to near by neighborhoods like japantown. and the room itself! it\\'s so beautiful and my friends and i had to practically peel ourselves from the room and force ourselves come check-out time. hardwood floors! a cute little fireplace! a chandelier over a claw foot bathtub?(!) if i could some how become the fictional cartoon carmen sandeigo so i\\'d have the magical ability that she had to steal impossible to remove locations like the eiffel tower or \\r\\nthe grand canyon, then i would lift ryan\\'s apartment with the quick desperation of a black friday sales junkie. book this place. trust me, because the only thing you\\'ll regret is not booking more days. we loved our stay at ryan\\'s place.  historic building, spacious, clean, comfortable and full of character.  ryan was super friendly and easy to talk to and willing to answer all our questions.  we definitely recommend staying here.  its a wonderful place and very convenient to get to the downtown. we love the kitchen and the view outside the window is beautiful.near the downtown. love the design of the house^-^ryan\\'s apartment was wonderful and in a beautiful neighborhood. he was a very accommodating host and was easy to contact when we needed to check in late and leave our bags in the apartment past the check out time. our stay at ryan\\'s place was perfect! not only was his place in a great neighborhood for nearby attractions but more importantly ryan and his place are awesome. having never used an airbnb before, ryan was able to help me decide on things to do in san francisco based on numerous email exchanges between him and i. this put my mind at ease for the overall airbnb experience given that we were staying in a perfect strangers home. we arrived late and ryan touched base with me prior to flight to ensure that i was able to enter his home without hassle. when we arrived, the place was clean, inviting and overall a very charming place. we had free reign of the kitchen and had our own private bedroom and bathroom, all of which were clean and accommodating. we actually met ryan the following day and he checked in with us to make sure our needs we met up to that point and after a brief interaction we were back in our own company. the best thing about the experience is that ryan didn\\'t interfere with our trip but i also knew that he was a phone call or text message away from any questions or concerns. i would highly recommend this place to stay in sf.ryan is a great host. the area is very nice and the apartment is impeccable. great taste in decoration and very spacious.   i was very comfortable during my stay. i look forward to staying there again in the near future. thanks!

we rented the bar and an extra room for an event. the venue is absolutely gorgeous, very cozy and stylish, everybody loved it! the staff was extremely nice and helpful.\\r\\nthe only downside is that no parking was provided for the organizers but there\\'s plenty of street parking around the hotel so it was easy to find :)the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.excellent, very well located place to stay in sanfrancisco. most helpful host  with complete knowledge of the best places to see and eat in sanfrancisco. thanks to her that we enjoyed our stay to the fullest. would be glad to stay here again. the description of beth\\'s place is entirely accurate, with one major omission - an excellent host! her home is immaculate, well-designed, and comfortable, and from the first night, i felt as if i was visiting an old friend. playing with her two very sweet, very well-behaved dogs was an added bonus.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was here for a business trip and can\\'t speak to the character of the neighborhood on weekends, but during the week, i found it safe and clean, with easy access to running trails, yoga, and transportation options. \\r\\n\\r\\nin short, i highly recommend considering this listing.we had a wonderful stay.  this is a great location within the marina district of san fransisco.  beth was a great host and was very helpful with whatever our needs where.  we would definitely stay here again.  \\n\\ntim wjust great - what an authentic sf home, beautifully finished and in a great area.vlad was very nice and easy to work with. he was very accommodating and made the check-in process a breeze. the home is very functional / efficient in its layout and has all the amenities you would ever need. i\\'d highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in sf.this home is truly a palace. it was nice to be only one block from the l muni line and save on transportation downtown. we enjoyed the all the seating for board games and the like, and the abundance of (matter of opinion to be sure) over-the-top decor -- from a louis xiv style matching bedroom set, to victorian curtains. we had a wonderful time and i can highly recommend this place. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again!  it was such a treat to stay here!michael and vlad were so accommodating and easy to communicate with. parking was great and the place had everything we needed. the beds were so comfortable and the plush towels in the bathroom were nice.we all had a great time at the house. it was clean and beautifully furnished. check in and out was a breeze and communication with michael and vlad was great. highly recommended.my family and i traveled to sf for a short weekend trip. michael and vlat were super easy to work with. everything was set up prior to our arrival. they were very sweet that prepared a manual for us to check in, every features were explained very well in the manual. the house is spacious. matched the photos from their listing. i would recommend their house to anyone travel to sf.the house is really big!! it includes 3 floors, 1 kitchen, 3 restrooms and 4 beds. my family traveled to sf and arrived in the midnight. the owner was very thoughtful and gave us a good guide. the area is not so far away from downtown and it\\'s very quiet and comfortable. it\\'s very suitable for family to live for a couple of days.the host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the house was fine, in a convenient location and pretty easy to get to. however, it hadn\\'t been cleaned after the last guests so it was dirty and in some disarray when we arrived. my friend was so jet-lagged he just climbed into a dirty bed and slept...i phoned vlad and requested a cleaner. once we had fresh bed-linen it was a much better experience, but the manner of our arrival took the shine off things. other than that, no complaints and it\\'s a nice big space.everything was good.  house was clean and very nice.  michael gave us a clear idea about house rules and about when to check in etc..\\n\\neveryone was pleased with the stay.this is a really big and comfortable place. and near have many good restaurants. our family like walk near the beach. the place to ocean beach only 5blocks. we really enjoy this house.  \\r\\nvery nice house!close to l line. michael is a really good guy, he brings two more beds when he knows we have 10 people.i truly enjoyed my stay here.   the bed was very comfortable, and i was treated to a spectacular sunrise in the morning.  the room has a lot of light, but there are shades to block it if you choose.  the private bath was very luxurious and clearly recently updated with the latest in shower heads and a heated toilet seat!  the shower was strong and lovely.  i joined the family for dinner and was treated to a wonder sampling of home-cooked indian food, all of which was excellent.  the only possible drawback for some is the third-floor location, which meant lugging my suitcase up the stairs.  luckily, i didn\\'t have to, though, as yogesh was happy to do so both ways!  all in all, a very nice room in a very nice part of town and a very nice family.  i would stay there again.the family is very hospitable and very friendly. the room is very comfortable with beautiful views and a bathroom with shower fantastic. the room is actually similar to that of a good hotel but with the company of a charming family. the neighborhood is very well connected to any part of the city by public transport very close. my first airbnb has been a fantastic experience! thank you family!i had a great stay w/ yogesh, kate and their kids.  the location is close to many good restaurants, shops, and public transportation.  the room was very nice w/ a terrific view of the city.  the renovated bathroom was wonderful (especially the shower!).  the hosts really made me feel at home and did a very good job of balancing family interaction with respect for privacy.  the indian dinner yogesh prepared one evening was excellent!  this is a family with two well-behaved, friendly, energetic children, who like to interact - i considered that a plus, but if you\\'d rather not be around young children, you may want to look elsewhere.  highly recommend this place!very hospitable and understanding hosts. room itself is well appointed and comfortable. great location and the views are even better than advertised!nice private room & bath with awesome shower.  good location -- its an easy walk to the 24th st mission bart and very close to the j-church line stop in noe.  great view from the east-facing window (but the sun does come in early).  i actually interacted very little with kate and yogesh, since i came in late and left early.  but they seem like very nice people and yogesh was very accommodating of my last minute schedule.the other reviews already describe the place very well; the view is stunning, the bed is comfortable, the private bathroom is spacious, modern and clean, and of course, the location is one of the absolute best in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut the real plus is yogesh and his family. two super-adorable kids and a very friendly (but not overbearing) cat. i didn\\'t actually get to meet kate (hopefully next time) but yogesh was so friendly, accommodating, and interesting to talk to, i feel like i\\'ve made a new friend. \\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended, and i look forward to my next visit!kate and yogesh were amazing hosts who invited us into their home as if we were part of the family. they gave us helpful tips and advice as we were also moving to san francisco and they never hesitated to invite us to dinner. also their two boys were so adorable and fun to hang around.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room was spacious enough for the two of us with a lot more stuff than people usually travel with since we were moving. the bathroom was such a big plus and having it attached to the room added privacy you don\\'t often find in san francisco!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe left kate and yogesh\\'s house feeling like we had made new friends and would recommend this place to anyone.5-31-12 to 6-6-12\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a wonderful stay in san francisco for our anniversary!   a huge thanks goes to kate, yoghesh, deven & rohan for being so warm and accommodating.  there was great hospitality shown by them including a sunday vegan brunch to accommodate us along with fresh carrot juice.  it was super tasty and very thoughtful of them.  we also shared an evening wine and wonderful conversation. \\r\\n\\r\\nyou two are a pair of intelligent, respectful and nice californians.  it was a delight to come \"home\" to noe valley every night.  the neighborhood is peaceful, very scenic and the food on 24th street hits the spot!  the view from our room was spectacular.  we also had no problem finding street parking.  deven & rohan were sweet, energetic boys. \\r\\n\\r\\nkate and yoghesh were both very helpful with their knowledge of the city.  they opened their kitchen, pantry, etc. to us and made us feel welcome.  we thoroughly enjoyed our time there and hope to come back soon and stay with the family again.  the room was clean, the bed was comfy.  the shower head & heated toilet were nice bonuses too!   we had a lot of privacy & couldn\\'t have asked for a better experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you,\\r\\n\\r\\ndr. pete & ann marie kate and yogesh made me feel like i was part of their family. i had a great time, their home is comfortable and in a great location. i look forward to visiting them again!my friend and i spent a paltry day and a half at kate and yogesh\\'s place, and we wish it could have been longer.  in particular, i really enjoyed my conversations with kate and the helpful tips that she and yogesh provided (which made it easier to do an impractical day-long tour of san francisco).  staying with them makes you feel like you\\'re home, and it makes for a perfect base for exploring the city.  safe neighborhood, wonderful views from the room (i\\'m partial to the fog, so the view was great even if the weather wasn\\'t cooperative), lovely accommodations, and a friendly and laid-back environment -- a terrific first experience for me on airbnb! thanks again, kate and yogesh!  kate and yogesh are extremely hospitable hosts.  the room was welcoming and the shower was wonderful.  everything was clean and nicely presented.  their home is very centrally located with easy access to all the wonderful shops, restaurants, and coffee shops we could hope for.  they were kind enough to invite us to eat with the family on two occasions.  the vegan cuisine was delicious.  they are a lovely young family with two adorable little boys who frequently made us laugh.\\r\\nwe would definitely stay with them again. highly recommended. while in san francisco, my goddaughter, meygan, and i enjoyed our home away from home.  kate and yogesh were warm, inviting hosts and gave us valuable advice on where to eat (don\\'t miss taqueria cancun!) and how to navigate throughout the city.  and, of course,  the boys were simply delightful and provided us with much laughter!  we enjoyed eating brunch one morning with the family  - yogesh prepared delicious blueberry pancakes and kate provided freshly squeezed carrot juice!  we felt right at home.  our bed was so comfortable, the shower was wonderful, and the view from the bay window in our bedroom was fantastic!   the neighborhood was quiet and had easy access to public transportation (the muni and bart).   believe me, this place can\\'t be beat (especially for the price!). - kathy kennedy/houston\\r\\ni stayed with kate and yogesh for my trip to san francisco for an art exhibition that i had work in.  the room offers beautiful views of san francisco, whether of the fog rolling out or basking in the sun.  the location is excellent and i stumbled upon a saturday farmers market that made me wish i lived in the neighborhood.  i was able to get around only using public transportation, both bart and muni.  i would stay here again if offered the chance to return to the bay area.kate and yogesh (and deven and rohan!) were fantastic hosts - very welcoming, could not have made me feel more comfortable on my first airbnb experience.  their house and the room is lovely, location great, the wealth of information provided is fantastic.  thought i\\'d take them up on the offer of a meal with the family one night of my stay - ended up eating a meal cooked at their home by their friends!

everything was wonderful during our stay! it was a perfect location easily accessible to lots of things in sf. the views were beautiful! awesome place for our team to stay!kate & yogesh were very responsive, helpful and easy to contact. they condo has a beautiful view and is in a nice area.location for our weekend in the city was perfect! the views of the city are great. yogesh and kate made sure that we were well informed and given all the information that we needed prior to our arrival. the condo itself is very large and has plenty of room to accommodate a large group. we really enjoyed our stay and would return in a heartbeat.kate and yogesh were reliable and available hosts. they answered really quickly all our questions and made everything they could to  make our stay as pleasant as possible. their home is spacious and comfortable. and the views are wonderful. we had a great stay there. juliathis is a fine apartment in an excellent location.  five of us stayed here for five nights, and one evening our extended family of 13 enjoyed a holiday dinner together.  the kitchen and dining area accommodated us all very nicely.  \\r\\nthe house is at the top of a hill, and the apartment on the third floor.   the location provides magnificent views, but it would be a problem for anyone with physical limitations.  fortunately, everyone in our party was in good shape so we were able to access the shops and great restaurants in the mission without calling a cab.  we made multiple trips down and up the hill on foot and enjoyed the exercise.\\r\\nwhen we first arrived, we observed some deficiencies in cleanliness.  among other things, the housekeeper had forgotten to prepare the refrigerator, leaving food residue and items that obviously should have been discarded such as partially consumed jars of baby food.  the owners graciously offered to have the housekeeper return to complete her work, but we didn’t find this to be necessary as there were no issues that we ourselves couldn’t easily correct.  \\r\\nthe condo is really large perfect for families. awesome views and very cozy atmosphere. the host seem very nice. parking was tricky but the host gave us good info where to park so it was fine. yogesh was incredibly accommodating during our stay by giving us tips on parking, as well as an easy way of checking in once we got there. first and foremost, the views from the top unit of the home is incredible. from the bedrooms you can see all the way out to the bay bridge as well as the sf skyline. the home is also located in a wonderful neighborhood that is just a few blocks away from dolores park, as well as valencia and mission restaurants. during our stay we were able to walk to delicious eats such as bi-rite creamery. the home is also quite spacious with separate kitchen, dining, and living rooms. overall, i would rate this stay a 5/5. great place!  everything was clean and the entire experience was a pleasure, including dealing with the owners.  great location as well.the logistics prior to and upon arrival were smooth. the condo was as advertised and we enjoyed the amenities. almost all of the items were in working order - most importantly the internet. i let the owners know that the tv was unplugged from the last renter (i think) and that one of the 3 house keys were missing. very minor and easy things but wanted to let the owner know. \\r\\n\\r\\nlocation was great, i enjoyed walking down to 24th, hanging a left and enjoying downtown noe valley. a couple of runs in the morning up to twin peaks was also sincerely awesome - all topped off by a trip to philz coffee every day. great spot, nice place, good price.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you for a wonderful stay.while i didn\\'t meet kate and yogesh in-person, their home was great for our stay. my colleagues and i were in town for a conference in downtown, and we were able to catch the bart at 24th st a short walk away. the location is within close proximity to good food as well. the views from the house are unmatched, though that means it does require walking up a major hill to get back to the house; that is expected for the noe valley neighborhood. the home matches the pictures and description in the listing, and yogesh was very responsive via e-mail when we needed to reach him. i would highly recommend!  great home in a great location; hosts were communicative and very kind. would highly recommend.the home was clean and welcoming. plenty of room for us 9 girls!perfect, as always.  well kept, stunning views.  will be back. i miss the moon over san francisco!kate and yogesh were extremely reactive and helpful at each step of our stay, from preparation to check out. the condo is spacious and provides plenty of space for seven/eight people. views have been gorgeous. fridge and pantry were generously stocked which eased our lives in particular for our first day as we arrived very late. what we underestimated a bit is the hilly environment and the stairs and the challenge they would be for my 76 year old mother. cool for us as we are runners and enjoyed the ups and downs, not so cool for her as she is not so mobile anymore. this was the only draw back in an otherwise well organised accommodation in a lively and thriving neighbourhood.it is a great place with great location!one of the greatest travel experinces. great location, great apartment and the view over the city was breathtaking! thanks so much for the stay :) kate and yogesh were very easy to communicate with and the apartment was as described.the condo was clean and had everything you needed. beautiful views and a wonderful, quiet neighborhood. good for families. the shops and cafes on 24th are very close and very convenient. \\r\\nmission st. being close is great as well!\\r\\nyogesh was very helpful and a good host. \\r\\nelizabeth and james\\' home is a delight. immaculately clean, fresh and extremely homely in a great location.\\r\\ngreat feel of space in a tranquil setting.\\r\\nsuperb kitchen, cozy lounge and fabulously comfortable beds.\\r\\ncannot fault.\\r\\nelizabeth was charming and extremely helpful during our correspondences, unfortunately the family were out of town during our stay.\\r\\nthis was my first airbnb experience and based on this wonderful stay it will not be the last.\\r\\nthank you elizabeth and james, really memorable.\\r\\n\\r\\n me, my husband, and my two kids had an amazing stay at elisabeth and james\\' home. we absolutely loved the house -- it was updated, stylish, cozy, and the perfect amount of space for us while we were touring the city for 4 days. the home is just as beautiful as in the photos. the living room was inviting and comfortable, and the kitchen was perfect for cooking. the bedrooms were roomy and the beds were comfortable. elisabeth and james even provided a blowup mattress in the third bedroom. to top it all off, the whole home is beautifully decorated. elisabeth and james were reachable and accommodating throughout the entire stay and left great recommendations for places to visit in the neighborhood. this home truly made our stay great. we had the best time at elisabeth and james\\' home! it was our first airbnb experience and id say it went well! i loved pretending like i secretly lived there in sf for that week; each morning, walking out the front door, off the awesome porch down the steep steps. it wa charming to say the very least. even their tea kettle was cool. i was inspired after meeting them and leaving their home! we actually were greeted by the couple upon checking in. nice to get to chat/know them a little bit before we got to stay in their home. we appreciated their taste and decor style so much and were very gald we decided to stay there vs closer in to the city in an upgraded room ( bc we were traveling with two children and needed extra space). the location is great, close to things in golden gate park, presidio park and even only 10-20 mins maybe to the touristy things in greater sf. we appreciated walking to the parks along the beautiful inner richmond neighborhood but i think my most favorite part was walking downstairs and opening the back door to let in the cool, fresh, crisp air and all the feelings that provided. just the idea of having a door open is something foreign to me being from texas but also their back deck is so charming and inviting! a perfect place to nestle up with a cup of coffee before my kids woke and have a quiet time and soak in the fresh air and prepare for my day! \\r\\n\\r\\nonly a few cons- tv was tricky but that\\'s unnecessary really- just needed a couple times for kids. they do have directions but that\\'s not saying a lot coming from me bc im not high tech, so still couldn\\'t get it but didn\\'t really care.  don\\'t watch tv much at home at all. no microwave but just used the oven, so not a huge set back. no ac but also not a huge deal, we just opened the window to cool off and shut before bed, if you\\'re not used to leaving windows open at night which we aren\\'t in dallas, and the small fan helped just fine . \\r\\n\\r\\nif you\\'re travelinh with kids it\\'s wonderful bc my kids loved playing with all the new toys and reading new books which you don\\'t have to bring along with you. they had great recommendations and made us feel so welcome when they took off. it was like we were friends after only getting to know each other for 15 minutes! highly recommend staying in their nice home  wow!! fantastic stay at this fabb house, pictures don\\'t do it justice. tdhe description is spot. easy to get anywhere by bus, shops close by great location. would recommend this without hesitation.  elisabeth and james were ajoy to deal with, eas to contact and rspond quickly. loved our stay shame it wasn\\'t longeri traveled to san francisco with my husband and our 14 year old, 6 y/o and 11month old kids. \\r\\nelisabeth made us feel welcomed before we even stepped foot into their home!  her kind and thoughtful gestures are what got me : )\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore our arrival she asked if we needed any groceries in the fridge and pantry to feed the hungry kids after our east-west coast travel.  my family was so grateful to find cheese, bread, milk, cereal, juice, coffee, yogurt and berries--it made us feel at home almost immediately.  \\r\\nanother thing that was a big help and made our stay a lot more enjoyable, was being able to use their beautiful baby girl\\'s stroller, high chair, crib, and toys--it lightened our luggage load : )\\r\\nas a mom, both of these gestures go a long way! \\r\\n\\r\\nelisabeth was easily accessible and she was easy to work with  and communicate with. all pictures they have posted our 1000% true. the exterior of the house is beautiful, the every room was clean, organized and beautifully kept.  \\r\\nthe backyard was awesome to have for the kids to hang out in the morning before breakfast and for a late swing before dinner. \\r\\nthe beds were comfortable, the kitchen was great, the bathrooms perfect and the neighborhood was beautiful and quiet. i can\\'t ask for more. money well spent. \\r\\nwe don\\'t have anything negative to say and would stay at their home again if we travel back to sf. \\r\\nthey truly know how to host and make their guests feel at home! \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you! \\r\\nxo hollanderselisabeth and james were perfect hosts!  we couldn\\'t have wished for a better air bnb experience.  the house was superbly located, quiet, spotlessly clean and immaculately finished to the smallest detail throughout the house.  the bed was very comfortable, the kitchen well stocked, the interior was superb - designer but really homely and comfortable.  i felt so at home here i expected my cat to come trotting in! best air bnb yet.  we\\'ve already talked of returning.  thanks elisabeth and james.we had an amazing 5 nights in san francisco and elisabeth and james\\' home was perfect for us with a 3 year old and an 11 month old. elisabeth was so helpful and efficient when communicating before our arrival so that we had everything we needed and more. \\r\\nthe location was great. the house itself was fantastically presented but also really homely. i could genuinely run out of superlatives for our stay! elisabeth and james were perfect hosts and i can\\'t even explain how gorgeous, comfortable and wonderful their home is! it was perfect for us traveling with a 3 year old and a 6 month old. elisabeth was so sweet and brought her daughter\\'s exersaucer and baby toys out of storage for my 6 month old to use while we were there. and the house was full of wonderful toddler toys that kept my 3 year old very happy. they also left their daughter\\'s very nice stroller for us to use. the beds are incredibly comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. elisabeth even contacted us before we arrived to ask if we\\'d like anything specific from the grocery store. the house is wonderfully decorated and also very cozy and homey feeling. the backyard is very comfortable as well with seating, swings and a slide. location was great as well. i seriously can\\'t say enough wonderful things about this home or the hosts! fantastic home in a surprisingly interesting and accessible neighborhood! the house is tastefully decorated, very comfy and relaxing. kitchen is well equipped except for a microwave (was not an issue for us but if you\\'re planning on tv dinners, keep this in mind). the neighborhood was the surprise (for us) - it is beautifully quiet, yet very close to major sf landmarks and has excellent restaurants within walking distance - so if you\\'re traveling for some r+r, see the city, or just experience daily living in sf (with a morning run in golden gate park or the presidio) - this is it. we were traveling with our 5-month old (her first big trip to the city) and this house was just perfect for her - room to play, toys, crib, bouncer, stroller - you name it. elisabeth & james were conscientious hosts, taking care to stock the fridge and staying in touch. highly recommended, worth every penny.    my group and i had a great time in the house: close enough to the beach to hear the waves, an excellent coffeeshop nearby, the muni a few blocks away, easy parking, and a great yard and deck. and dan is great to work with. a great experience all around.beautiful home, just as advertised and everything was great. exceptional communication, and very clean and welcoming experience. theresa, greeted us at the house. to go over everything. she was very nice. she left us wine and candy and snacks for the kids. the house is located in a quite neighbourhood. with stores and restaurants close by. \\nwe really enjoyed staying there, and would recommend it to anyone. we loved this place!

a beautiful house! the house was exactly as described and extremely clean. the instructions theresa provides covers everything. she has put a lot of effort and time into explaining every detail - thank you! what i personally loved about theresa\\'s house is the natural lighting and air flow. several large windows on the second floor provide unique view of the courtyard below. overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area. our stay in this home was wonderful.  the house is beautifully appointed and decorated.  we spent lots of time in the outdoor patio.  the location is convenient.  we rented a car to get around so having a designated parking spot was highly convenient.  i would stay here again!

 best location in the city, totally convenient to everything and it\\'s on a quiet block.  the fire house across the street was no problem.  inside there are beautiful plants, comfy bedrooms and a lovely deck to hang out on.  the photos didn\\'t do it justice. i never met robin, but she was helpful and friendly over text.  truly a great stay.christine and julia (didn\\'t have the pleasure to meet ginger) were great hosts and very accommodating considering i booked very last minute. the room is spacious and comfortable, storage is in abundance which helped keep luggage out of site. the house itself is beautiful and has great views from the living room. myself and my girlfriend enjoyed our 2 nights at the pow house and we loved the personal bedroom plaque, the warm welcome and very generous amenities also parking out side was just perfect. breakfast was always provided and probably the best thing about our stay was hanging out with emma (brand new puppy). mission is 12mins away and the main tourist areas north of sf are around 25mins away. the guys are so cool and great to talk to too, local knowledge is also very good with very strong recommendations of sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nmajor brownie points for posting our poster that we managed to leave behind by mistake, the guys were so kind in doing this for us, again really appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended from both myself and my girlfriend.staying in the pow house was amazing. the girls are very nice and funny ;-) i can recommend this place to everyone.it was a great pleasure to stay with ginger, christine, and julie, and to meet bobo and emma!

the house was very clean and nice! we were there for 4 days. they had a cat \"booboo\" that was so cute and greeted us whenever we come home. if we ever come back to san francisco we would definitely want to stay there again! parking was easy and if you don\\'t take the car to the city it was a max 5 minute walk to the muni train that took us directly to the center of the city without chancing trains. i high recommend this place!

nice house, nice people. i was pretty busy with work but one of the nights there i had dinner with them. it was lovely. i stayed a week and it was really nice. the girls are very helpful, easy to chat with and fun. the room is spacious, the closet is big, and the bed is very comfy. the house is big and in great shape, the view from the balcony to downtown was amazing. the girls really make an effort to keep the whole place clean and cosy. getting to caltrain takes about 25min on public transport. thank you guys for letting me use washing machine and dryer.it was fun staying with the pow house kids (and pets!) for 30 days. getting in was no hassles, the place is quiet and tidy, and i felt very welcomed when ginger and venus invited me to share dinner with them on the first night.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was in the middle of a project crunch, so came home late most nights and didn\\'t see much of anyone very often. it was really nice to sit on the balcony with a glass of water (and a cat or dog), and look over to the bay bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only issue i had was despite the usual peacefulness, sometimes earplugs are useful: booboo the cat sometimes miaows to come in, and one night there was a group staying in the other airbnb room who weren\\'t respectful about noise and the shared bathroom (but that\\'s on them, not on the fabulous hosts!)we were made to feel very welcome and right at home! just a short walk up the hill from the t train, the pow house was clean, lovely and just as advertised. a comfy bed, warm shower and gracious hostesses made this a real pleasure of a stay. in the mornings we were greeted by christine who made us fresh coffee and waffles and gave us advice on sightseeing, weather and uber use. if we ever go back to san francisco we will definitely stay here again and recommend it highly!i had a great time at the pow house. the place was very neat and tidy. i will book the place again the next time i visit the city.the house was great. i was staying with 2 others and we had plenty of space. the bathroom was clean and the shower pressure was perfect. our host was very friendly and had some great food recommendations for our visit to sf. the location was also very safe. check-in and check-out was no issue at all as the instructions were very clear. highly recommend!amazing host. venus was super down to earth and just incredibly cool to hang out with. we played cards with some of her friends and it was totally an organic, intimate and fun experience. i\\'d do it again!the host is very friendly and hospitable. the apartment feels very urbanized and unique and clean. it is a very nice place to stay at. the location is not far away from most must-go-places of sf. highly recommended.i had a very pleasant stay, and the girls hosting us were very nice and friendly. there\\'s a beautiful view from the small little balcony they have, and the room was very comfortable.fantastic new modern house, very nice and super clean. julie, christine, and venus were all lovely, even cooked dinner for us one night when they had friends over!

a/c would bei nice! thank you!annie made us feel welcome, and was flexible on our arrival time. we weren\\'t sure exactly when we were arriving and would just update her. the place was very clean and just as in the photo. neighborhood was fine. we enjoyed staying there. she responds immediately to any communication which was great.annie\\'s apartment was great! it has the comfort of a hotel room, but for a fraction of the price and a few kitchen facilities. annie was very nice and helpful.great location, a short walk to the train station gives you access to the whole city.    apartment was very clean, annie is very quick on responding if you have any questions.   we rented a car for 2 days and let us know where we could park it.  she left fruit and water in the mini fridge for us.  also she had shampoo and soap in the bathroom(we brought our own but it was nice). the apartment is behind a gate that you need to have a key to, me and my wife felt very safe and i thought the neighborhood was great.   i\\'m very glad we stayed in annie\\'s apartment the apt was very conveniently located in an area that is easy to park in and is a little bit outside of the hectic city. a great place to come back to and unwind. the room was nice and clean and annie was a great host.the place is in very good conditions and annie is so nice. very recommendable if you rent a car.annie was very kind and generous! the room is perfect for those looking for privacy. had everything except a tv. but nonetheless i would stay here again! thanks annie!annie was an excellent host. we arrived early and she was able to accommodate us well before check in. the only downside was the location. if you rent a car the drive is about 30 min to the city (not too bad) however, the public transportation is a 55 min ride to the city (union square/nob hill/coot tower/etc). other than that, the expertise was good. i had an amazing stay at annie\\'s place. she is such a nice person and always make you feel welcome. the room is clean, and you have everything you need. highly recommend it! the views in this home are indeed panoramic and available to you 24/7, something which we discovered after a long trip from australia. if you are a fan of exercise then you will enjoy getting around the quiet neighbourhood. the home is away from the hustle of the city and is quiet enough for a peaceful stay. you may even get the opportunity to interact with some of the friendly locals.\\r\\nif you are a fan of dogs, you will enjoy meeting the host’s poodle, which lives at the home (though not while you are staying there of course!)\\r\\nan wonderful place with a breathtaking view and a perfect host.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the middle of san francisco, up on the hill, very close to all attractions but still quiet and secluded in spacious property.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you jeannine i staid at jeannine\\'s house for two weeks with my family (three adults and one 10years old). \\r\\n\\r\\njeannine was a wonderful host. she made us feel very welcome and at home. she is full of little attentions and reachable at any time. the house is beautiful. it is very big and has an amazing view on the bay. it is also decorated with a lot of taste. the location is ideal: close to the city center, at&t park, ferry building, etc. but at the same very quiet and peaceful. the house also has an amazing garden, very well maintained. you can observed many different beautiful birds, like hummingbirds.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely recommend jeannine and her house to anyone.it was above our expectations.  we could use everything in the house and jeannine even filled the fridge with all kinds of delicious food and drinks for us. the house is very cosy with lots of space and everything is well maintained. fresh towels are provided each day. \\r\\nwe had to take a taxi to the city (15 minutes) but in return you get a spectacular view  from the balcony and we could even have breakfast in the garden.\\r\\nthanks a lot jeannine for your hospitality and hopefully we can come back next year.\\r\\ni was recently in san francisco on a business trip and had the pleasure of staying in jeannine\\'s home.  my colleagues and i are fortunate to have stumbled upon this one.  jeannine was a great host and took a lot of care to be sure we knew everything about the property.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe views are fantastic and we especially loved the kitchen where we prepared meals daily.  the neighborhood is ideal too.   besides being in close proximity to our corporate office, there are several local eateries, a couple of neighborhood grocers and spent plenty of time at connecticut yankee for a great selection of beers and to root for the giants\\r\\n\\r\\ni plan to to book jeannine\\'s place in the future as i\\'m a frequent visitor to san francisco.  jeanne was a fantastic host, she went above and beyond to make sure we had everything that we needed. she left fruit, water, pastries and a bottle of wine for us on arrival, it couldn\\'t have been a better welcome!\\r\\nthe house is absolutely stunning, the interior decor really reflects jeannine\\'s personal style and felt like home straight away.\\r\\ni would highly recommend her to anyone thinking about visiting san fransisco. \\r\\nwe had an amazing stay and were so sad to leave..we had a fantastic time at jeannine\\'s house in protero hill. we were a group of 3 gals in for dreamforce and the location, neighbour and house were just fantastic! close enough to get in and out of the city quickly, it proved to be a little oasis from the craziness of san francisco through df week. two blocks from the house is a great little strip of restaurants, bars and cafe\\'s and we did our best to explore as many of them as possible. jeannine made us feel welcome from the first, and being able to live in her lovely house, with a great view down over the oakland bay was wonderful. thanks jeannine!i stayed in jeannine\\'s home once before and had a truly magical stay, this time was no different! jeannine is a exceptional host and i love staying in my \\'home away from home\\', i feel i truly belong there. everything about jeannin\\'s home is perfect and i could not recommend it more!this place is awesome! the people are great and erik is super accommodating. five stars :)erik was a wonderful and caring host. he is always open to requests. the accomodation is great, because i could meet numerous cool people from all over the world. it is a really good cultural experience. besides the location of the appartment is great, as it is on the pacific coast and has a good connection to sf downtown. erik, thanks for nice time. this place was amazing.. i booked it super last minute, very cheap price for an amazing location and clean place to stay.. this was my first time using air b&b and i will never use a hotel ever again if i don\\'t have to.. erik was a really good guy. he showed up late morning to see how your night was and if there is anything he can get you. i 100% recommend this place as i will definitely be coming backa very pleasant stay at eriks place. the rooms are shared with other fellow travelers, and the beds are bunkbeds with airmatresses, wich are pretty comfortable, but quize noisey at every single move. the kitchen/living room area is very nice, and the couches are very easy to fall asleep on after an all nighter. check in/out times are flexible, i arrived to the house before erik and could rest and use the utilities in it.\\r\\nduring my stay there were about 10 other housemates coming and going, i don\\'t know if some selection is made but all of them were kind and friendly! best place to meet ppl from all around the world and hang out together.\\r\\nerik is a warm open minded and cool host! visit the house everyday and checking that everything is alright, fixing stuff if needed and is open to add more features to the house, just ask him. couldn\\'t ask for a better host.\\r\\nlocation is perfect, walk distance to the beach, few grocery stores and one big supermarket (safeway) is about 15-20 minutes walk. muni transportation train station is about 1 minute walk from home and leads you to main spots in the city (union square, chinatown, market st etc.)\\r\\nenjoyed my time there and definitely would come again!this was the second time i stayed at erik\\'s home \"sf, golden gate park, etc.\" and my experience was even better than the first time.  erik has remodeled this house so it is all new and modern, with a nice kitchen and bathrooms, fixtures, etc., and everything is in good shape.  the home is set up to accomodate many travelers, with bunk beds and clearly posted guidelines and reasonable rules, and it works great!  the best things about this lodging are: ( 1 ) very close to the n line light rail, which goes directly to downtown, ( 2 ) very close to the beach; an easy walk to miles of wide beach and sand dunes, ( 3 ) good price for the area, ( 4 ) great common living room and kitchen and dining room area, with 2 very comfy couches and other perfectly nice furniture, ( 5 ) well organized, so people know what to do to make the system work.  i loved meeting travelers from all over the world and everyone was very courteous about sharing bathrooms and the like.  wireless was fine.  free street parking was sometimes a bit tricky to find, but this is sf after all.  erik has the place cleaned frequently and it was in good shape for the 4 days when i was there.  recommended.i was very satisfied i felt safe and comfortable. i will be recommending this place to others, in fact a friend had already asked for the info. only problem or maybe it was me was no tv. high rating 10+ stars thank you thank youfirstly, i enjoyed my stay here, would recommend it to others seeking a low cost place to stay, and would return here myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nthat said, you should know that this is a shared-living space, and you don\\'t get your own room for $40/night. you stay in clean, well-kept bunk beds with air-mattresses. mine was very comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\nas a guest, you must be considerate towards others, follow the house rules, and try to stay fairly quiet inside the house. low voice, listen to music with headphones, take phone calls outside. \\r\\n\\r\\nerik\\'s house is a place to store your things safely and sleep at night, and for it\\'s purpose, it is excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy main comment to the owner is: don\\'t raise the price per night. it\\'s great where it is, and should stay there. besides that, you\\'ve got everything else down very well.eric is the man! wouldnt want to stay anywhere else! super hospitable and a great house.erik\\'s place is located in a very nice neighborhood: very close to public transportation (that takes you quite quickly to the city center and pretty much anything you\\'ll want to see in sf), to the ocean, the golden gate park and a lot of nice shops, grocery stores, restaurants and cafes. the house is big and the air mattress i slept on was comfortable. i found everything i could need during my stay. this was a great experience for me : maybe some of you need a lot of privacy when traveling, and would want another kind of air bnb place, but sharing this house with other travelers made me meet great people and made my stay in sf (as a backpacker who travels alone) really awesome! i did not get the chance to spend a lot of time with erik, but he was very nice and made sure i had everything i needed! thanks a lot, i will definitely come back to your place next time i\\'m in sf!!erik is a cool dude.  arrived after dark and cold af,  couldn\\'t get the lock box to open and he was cool about driving to the place to help me and show me around.  place is close to public transport and a grocery coop.  definitely recommend.our host maureen is a very helpful, friendly & generous host, she went the extra mile for us & gave several tips about san francisco! the room is very stylish & the amenities superb. wonderful quiet neighborhood, with easy access to public transport. highly recommended!maureen was excellent host. she welcomed us warmly on arrival.the room was lovely and cozy.it was exactly as in the photos.\\r\\nlocation was very good with full of cafes, restaurents within 10minutes walk. it was my first airbnb experience and i feel lucky to have met maureen.\\r\\nhighly recommended.\\r\\nwould love to come back next time i come to sfc!\\r\\ni even before my friend and i booked this suite, our host, maureen helped me navigate through the airbnb process. she graciously welcomed us with fresh flowers in each room, a wide variety of drink choices, breakfast options and snacks. the rooms are comfortable and the bookcases are full of interesting selections that include travel guides and restaurant reviews for sf and beyond. maureen provided transportation tips for getting around the city and recommended must see attractions. her home is located in a quiet neighborhood and within walking distance to unique shops and lots of places to eat. she is a wonderful host and i have already directed my friends to her page. we would definitely come back to stay again!we stayed recently at maureen\\'s suite and found it to be very thoughtfully appointed.  there were lovely breakfast choices. \\nthe street is very quiet and located within walking distance to shops, bakery, and the fantastic views atop pacific heights. \\nthe suite is comfortable, newly furnished and clean. the bathroom is small but new, and was done so well with very nice fixtures \\nand tile and large shower size that i really enjoyed using it. towels were nice too. maureen is very helpful and responsive to questions \\nand lives in the home. my only reservation is that the bed was nice, a tempurpedic-style mattress, but if you have back problems as i do \\nyou might need a firmer mattress. \\n\\ni would recommend this lovely suite and thoughtful hostess.\\nwe had a very comfortable stay with maureen in sf. she was incredibly accommodating by waiting up for us from our delayed flight,helping us find our way around sf,providing delicious breakfast goods and all sorts of teas for our british morning wake up! good communication throughout the stay,can be left to own devices. facilities as described and maureen gave us some local hotspots to check out for food,groceries and shopping. great location in a nice neighbourhood to get on the muni bus service which takes you directly to town or the piers. we had such a lovely time staying here that we had a nice evening out with maureen and her daughter on our last evening. lovely people and would highly recommend maureen and her air bnb to anyone of any age. thank you for a great stay! maureen was an exceptional host - i cannot say a bad word about our experience staying in her gorgeous little place.\\r\\nthe place was set our beautifully, with an unexpected, but overwhelming and very appreciated stock lil kitchen area. the bed was an absolute gem to sleep on.\\r\\nwe literally had to drag ourselves away from the gorgeous oasis she has created to get out and enjoy san francisco\\r\\nmy husband & i enjoyed staying with maureen for almost a week. her house is beautiful inside and extremely comfortable, the living room & bedroom connected is spacious and beautifully decorated. the room is well furnished and warm blankets are provided even at the living room area. the neighbourhood is quiet and pretty, and we enjoyed morning & evening walks around it. it is also close to a lot of places we visited during our stay. \\n\\nmaureen also made sure that we had essentials like water, tea, coffee, milk, and even prepared cut fruits for us when we arrived extremely late after a long delay. she always checked in on us if we were comfortable and needed anything, she was readily available for any questions and to gave us suggestions and directions  when we needed.\\n\\nmaureen introduced her neighbourhood area to us when we checked in, she provided us with a map and a few good eating places especially the pastry & sushi store nearby her house. we had also travelled a week prior to this stay and maureen was so kind to offer to send our clothes for laundry and pick up for us after too. \\n\\nmaureen was such a great host to us and she even brought us up to the twin peaks, and chatted on a wide variety of topics in the evenings. we really enjoyed the time spent at her place and would definitely would stay at her place again the next time we visit sf. she made our stay much more memorable and fun! \\n\\nthis was a true gem. our first use of airbnb because of a convention taking all hotel rooms. maureen was terrific. helpful and provided a great stay.  location near fillmore st, quiet street, beautiful home and well stocked supplies.  convenient, comfortable and exceeded expectations.  i do not think we could have been any more satisfied with our stay!! maureen was the pillar of perfection as a host, she provided us with complete privacy while adding personal touches such as warm croissants in the morning or meat and cheese platters upon our return in the afternoon. the suite was exactly as described if not better, our expectations were completely exceeded! the bed was beyond comfortable and living area warm and inviting. maureen had literature on the city everywhere to help with planning our days. we explored the entire city of san francisco and maureen\\'s neighborhood was our favorite! it was within walking distance to all points of interest and in our opinion had the best restaurants in the city. it was quite, safe, and beautiful. we hope to visit again in the future and would not consider staying anywhere else!! thank you maureen for a truly wonderful stay!this is a wonderful place to stay, in a very quiet neighborhood with excellent ride-sharing access to anywhere in the city. (it is centrally located). the description was accurate completely. the location feels quite secure and arranging check-in and check-out were easy and very accommodating. the room is very spacious and beautifully decorated. wi-fi is fast and easy to connect. the queen bed was the most comfortable i have slept in and the sofa bed was also very comfortable.maureen was a wonderful host! she was super welcoming and even left us treats like hot croissants each morning. her home is beautiful and in a great location in pacific heights for sightseeing. i highly recommend staying with her - it was a great experience.everything was just as advertised\\r\\n except more welcoming.  maureen is great and the house is lovely. would absolutely stay with her again.maureen was a perfect host. friendly, forthcoming and helpful.\\r\\nwe were welcomed with a lovely bouquet of roses, a bottle of wine and fresh fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nmaureen\\'s place is lovely. a spacious, tastefully decorated living room and a large bedroom with a comfortable bed and quality linens.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bathroom is small but adequate, with a comfortable shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nmaureen\\'s place is spic & span clean and was serviced every day. clay street is a quiet street and nothing disturbed our sleep. a rare feat in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe lack of kitchen was not an issue as maureen generously provided croissants, toasted muffins, sausage and cheese for breakfast. the nespresso machine and a well-stocked fridge complemented the breakfast fare.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter spending decades in various hotels, b &

the neighborhood. the house is very comfortable, complete with fresh sheets, teas & snacks, ro filtered water that\\'s refilled daily, good toiletries and even some extra throws and comforters. 100% recommended. i was visiting san francisco for a short trip and stayed at maureen\\'s awesome place for two nights.  she greeted us upon arrival with lemon water, sliced asian pears, and a fully stocked fridge with everything we could possibly need. the space itself was immaculate, sunny, well appointed, and felt like home the moment we walked in.  not to mention the next morning after a stroll through the presidio we found warm croissants awaiting us upon our return!  truly a wonderful host and stay in every regard and i can\\'t wait to return to san francisco and stay again at

and tastefully decorated. we will come back!we had a wonderful experience! maureen made us feel very welcome and as though we were in our own home by adding extra amenities and daily fresh surprises. she was always available but not intrusive and wanted to be sure we always had whatever we needed. the location was quiet and easily accessible to parks, food, and exploring. we loved making a new friend enjoying many conversations with maureen and look forward to visiting her again.the host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.clean house, very welcoming guests, exactly what was expected. thanks for making my stay in sf great!ed was a fantastic and very hospitable host, i would recommend him to any traveler. although the location itself is close to some bad neighborhoods, you can easily circumvent them by taking the bus, it will be well worth it! great experience..... host very accommodating will book with againwe felt very welcomed by annie he. the accommodations were very similar to the description, very comfortable. \\r\\nit was a great host. this is a perfekt place to stay.annie\\'s place was very nice. she left fresh apples and bottled water in the fridge. nice touch. the room was very clean and the location made it easy to get around. thanks for everything! very nice, large, and comfortable room with private bathroom. good area but very limited parking. annie is very hospitable and responsive.the host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.santiagos place is very spacious  great view of  the bay area i only stayed one night  for the proximity  to sfo  but the location is greatheidi was a fantastic host! her apartment was warm and welcoming and i would recommend anyone to stay here. thank you heidi!ryan and mark were great. they were helpful with regards to local shops and directions. very easy to communicate with as well. i would stay again if the opportunity arose.the house is clean and in a fantastic location. it is a short walk to the warf and union square, and close to public transport. this was a great place for my group of six to stay in and we highly recommend it!jenny\\'s place was the perfect solution to our journey to san francisco.  we were 5 friends traveling to the city looking for an affordable option in the city that was close to everything.  we literally could not have found a better place.  it was right in the heart of the action.  it\\'s located in chinatown, which is a close walk to union square or down to the fisherman\\'s wharf.  there were three bedrooms which were clean upon arrival.  we had requested a last minute (day before) arrival and stay for two nights, and even though jenny was out of town, she was able to have her good friend stefanie help with the cleaning and preparation of the place when we got there the next day.  there is a lockbox for the keys which makes leaving and coming back to the apartment a breeze.  overall our stay was incredible.  we would definitely recommend the apartment to all looking for a great centrally located apartment in sf!!!jenny is an incredible host, very attentive to small details and super caring. house is great, lots of space for 4 ppl. very well located and you can easily go to any place in sf by cable car, car or taxi. highly recommend the place for 4-6 people.great location, comfortable, clean, warm, and very quiet! we needed an iron the first night and they delivered it!! we would definitely stay again.the place is very clean and in a great location for us - bathroom is small but very clean.  tina settled us in and was super warm and welcoming.  thanks so much!the apartment was in a good location and was clean and tidy. the host is great to communicate with and even left us a basket of goodies. thanks very much! the apartment was lovely, just as advertised. the bathroom was split into separate shower and toilet rooms, which was very convenient for our 6-person group, and the wifi was fast. \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen some of our group decided to stay an extra night, they called jenny and were able to work things out quite easily. all in all a wonderful first airbnb experience. thank you, jenny.excellent location, convenient to everything, but also on a quiet street. jenny went above and beyond to make me and my friends annual trip to san francisco a success! thanks, we\\'ll definitely stay at walker\\'s paradise again! flat is nicely located, next to chinatown, and at walking distance from fisherman’s wharf, telegraph hill, financial district and union square. cable car is another handy way to get to town.\\r\\nflat itself is ok but although it is advertised for six persons, the table in the living room really accommodates two persons and there are only 4 chairs. this is clearly inadequate and unsatisfactory, and should be improved. the bathroom is tiny and has only a shower and a wash-hand basin.the place is in a top location and close to almost everything! the rooms are clean and have everything that you could possibly need. the kitchen is well-equipped for cooking, which is great. tina was an amazing hostess: she gave us a warm welcome upon arrival and answered every question we had. the only set back is that the house altogether doesn\\'t have much light, but this shouldn\\'t matter if you\\'re out exploring all day. there\\'s only one bathroom, but we didn\\'t really have any problems with this and we were 6 people! i can definitely recommend this place!we had a great stay with 4 adults over new year\\'s eve. the place is well-represented by the photos and has a funky feel to it. it was very central to getting out in chinatown and to other fun areas of the city. when we had a fuse blow, the host was very quick to respond to our call/text and the issue was resolved in no time (the fuse box was in the basement, which we didn\\'t have access to).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host also allowed us to stay past the check out time because no one else was checking in that day. this was awesome because we wanted to chill for a while longer before catching our red-eye back to the east coast. me and my four friends had a fantastic stay in this beautifully decorated and furnished apartment near the centre of san francisco\\'s iconic chinatown. the apartment has a contemporary but homely vibe which in the centre of a busy city like san francisco feels like a oasis. it\\'s location is perfect to see all of san francisco\\'s top sights and attractions. jenny and her sister are very accommodating and make the process of checking in and checking out extremely easy, my experience in their apartment was very pleasant and i would not hesitate to stay there again.the perfect accommodation! great location, comfortable and very clean. thanks!first, the good. the flat is in a great and interesting location in chinatown. close to many attractions, bus and trolley lines. the bart, however, is a little less than a mile away. the hosts were easy to get a hold of, and were extremely accommodating with our check-in time. the apartment itself was very clean, had some great amenities (coffee, wine, chocolates left for us), and very comfortable beds.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow, for the not so good. the apartment is lacking in light. all of the windows look out on building walls (most of which are only a few feet away). this makes the apartment fairly dark all the time. also, the apartment is very noisy. not only do the upstairs neighbors make a lot of noise, but the apartment itself (with wood floors) is prone to amplifying noises made by people walking/talking within the apartment. needless to say, if you are a light sleeper, this is not the place for you.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, i was happy with this airbnb experience. we had 6 women staying together, and i think we had plenty of room (and no issue with only one bathroom). however, in the future, i would not stay there if i needed to make sure that i was well-rested. in other words, it\\'s fine for vacation; not so much for work/academic trips.we had a wonderful stay at tina/jenny\\'s place in san francisco. the apartment is conveniently located on the edge of china town/nob hill, close to little italy (?), financial district, piers, union squares, russian hill. all these neighborhoods are in walking distance. a lot of good restaurants. the apartment is clean and spacious for 6 or more people. above all, the host, tina is just really wonderful. she is quick to respond to our questions/requests. she is very accommodating (e.g., allowing us to leave our bags after checking out). she also provides a lot of useful information for the neighborhoods and tips etc. this is my best airbnb experience so far. if we go back to sf, we would love to stay there again! thank you, tina. i stayed at jenny\\'s place with two of my coworkers for 2 weeks and had an absolutely fantastic experience. we arrived to a welcome basket of wine, tea, etc and the place was very clean and ready for our stay. jenny was very communicative and emailed me shortly after my arrival to make sure everything was okay. she also emailed me before my departure to give clear checkout instructions. the apartment is in a really central location near lots of transport options. i would definitely stay here again.this place is very convenient to fisherman\\'s wharf and powell st since the cable car stop is only a 15 second walk. however, if you are 6 people to take the cable car, it may not have enough space for you all unless you take cable cars before 10:00 or after 18:00. one block away is a bus stop to at&t park, caltrain station and fisherman\\'s wharf. chocolate, cookie and wine are put on the tale in living room when we arrive. so sweet. the rooms are clean and comfortable. san francisco is cold for us, and the warming fan provided by tina saves us. the building is old but the rooms are remodeled. sound insulation is not good enough. noise is produced by upstairs, not outside. but we are outside from 9:00 to 19:00, so it is not a problem for us. tina is so accommodating. for example, we leave our baggage after check out time. as a result, it is a nice place to stay in san francisco.the location of this apartment cannot be beat.  it is within walking distance of all the major attractions in san francisco.  great location, close to embarcadero and the trolleys, and in the middle of chinatown.  it\\'s a great place to expore sf from, and plenty of room for a family or co-workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe views aren\\'t great, but it\\'s very cozy.as advertised, this is a terrifically located apartment in a super safe neighborhood, a short walk from chinatown, north beach, nob hill and a half block off the cable car line. great location, and it was easy to hail taxis in any direction. the apartment has no view, but is clean and pleasantly furnished and comfortable. the host is attentive and only a call or a text message away and she was kind enough to check on my 80 year old mother via phone to make sure she got in to the apartment ok, since she was arriving a few hours ahead of me. it is noisy. the upstairs neighbors walk across hardwood floors when they get home at midnight and 1 am, and you can hear their conversations. it\\'s also on the alley for the chinese hospital, so i was awakened each morning at 5:30am by the garbage truck picking up the hospital dumpsters. so i didn\\'t sleep much when i was there, but my mom slept through all of it.  so if noise doesn\\'t bother you, this is a very comfortable place to stay with good hosts and a great san francisco city location. i flew up to san francisco from honolulu to be a best man in a wedding. i had to coordinate and find a decent place for some of us to stay which was affordable (6 people, 2 couples and 2 single men), convenient, and close to the wedding venue which was at the terra gallery. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis place was perfect. there were two rooms for the two couples with queen size beds, and a room with two twin for the single men. they had a full sized kitchen which was perfect for those in between times during the trip, or late a night snacking. there were plates, cups, utensils, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe shower and the toilet was seperate. at first i found this odd since i\\'m not used to this type of architecture, but it worked out perfect. it was almost like having two bathrooms, which was perfect for getting ready the day of the wedding. \\r\\n\\r\\nthere was a small living room which we gathered in that was perfect for end of the day meetings and talks. there was a comfortable couch, soft area rug and small table for eating. it also had a wireless router, flat screen tv and most importantly iron and ironing board. \\r\\n\\r\\nto top it off we were welcomed with a small basket full of snacks and wine when we checked in. i stayed at this apartment last holidays with my family (6 in total) and it was excellent! the location is great, the apartment is very comfortable, clean and well furnished and the owners are really thoughtful! i would highly recommend this place to anyone going to san francisco! really nice apartment, in a central place in sf.\\r\\n\\r\\na walk thru chinatown will take you straight to union square and market street, nob hill just around the corner with a number of great restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment has three nice bedrooms and would be suitable for up til three couples. \\r\\n\\r\\nall in all a very good stay - and very helpful and quick responding host.\\r\\ngreat place. great host. great communication. everything was great! only issue was that the kids upstairs ran around a lot but it wasn\\'t too distracting. this is the san francisco base camp; everything within walking distance, nice appartment, no noise, has everything for a family of five. if you want to get into the san francisco feel, fast and easy this is the place.hosts were very nice, they gave us all the information we needed to get to the appartment, and they let us drop our luggages before the regular check-in  time :)i had a wonderful experience with both my host and the apartment itself. the host got back to me quickly when i booked and whenever i messaged her and was always friendly. there was a welcome basket when we arrived she left for us which was a very sweet touch. the apartment was clean and cozy with everything you would need. this place was definitely above and beyond what i had hoped for during my stay. the location was great as well. public transportation was super close and easy to access.we had a great stay here! the location was great, chinatown is a wonderful place where we felt very safe (area and the place), it was clean and comfortable. although we never get to meet the hosts they where very kind leaving a welcome basket. we had no issues at all and a handbook was also left with some tips for the place and the area that was very usefull.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe would definitely stay here again and we would definitely recommend staying here.\\r\\n the place was easy to find, clean and welcoming. even though we didn\\'t meet our host we got good information and help. the location is perfect if you like walking you can get to many places. for those sensitive to noice at odd hours from neighbours and street this might not be your first choice. host was responsive and amiable throughout the process, and my team reports that the apartment was as expected.  thanks so much!everything about the listing was spot on. the apartment was very clean and fully equipped for our needs. the beds were comfortable and there was even a lovely welcome basket when we arrived. i loved that the front door had a digital entry system as it made coming and going that much more easy without having to worry about multiple keys and losing them etc. the location, in the heart of chinatown, was superb with the cable car almost outside the front door.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host was very friendly and uber quick on communication which helped expedite enquiries.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend this listing and working with this host if you need a 3 bedroom place in san francisco. the host was great, though we didn\\'t get to meet her everything was well organized. the apartment was clean and as advertised. thanks again!perfect location for our group\\'s event at moscone center. nice, easy downhill walk and close cable car/bus ride back. other destinations were just as easy to access. nearby amenities made our stay very comfortable. look forward to a return!my experience at jenny\\'s was good. the apartment is well located in chinatown, which is very close to the union square (15 minutes walking). there\\'s good public transportation around. the neighborhood is quite busy during the day and calm at night. the apartment was clean and has good amenities. nevertheless it was a bit cold and the energy don\\'t stand too much power usage due to old electric system - so if you turn the hair dryer and the heaters on the power will shut down. jenny was a great host, always available a quick to respond. thank you!great location, a nice quiet but brightly lit alley in chinatown but a little away from the hustle. the inside is fairly spartan. you have to be careful to not blow a fuse by running the space heater and a blow drier. there is a bit of odor in the place, i could ignore it. roommate got a scented candle and all was ok. the place can be a little dark, but i found it cozy. living room was great to hang out with the large couch. overall, exactly as expected, perfect place for a group that wants to be right at chinatown.we booked this apartment for 4 colleagues to attend a conference and they were all thoroughly impressed. they said it was \"super clean\" and the \"kitchen was great, living room was great, bedrooms were great.\"  they did mention that the bathroom was a bit tight and that wifi only worked 100% in the living room (i.e. bedroom signal would get a bit spotty). that being said, the apartment and overall experience was awesome. we will recommend this apartment and definitely try to stay again. a+ jenny is very responsive and warm hearted. she made me feel like home. the apartment is really convenient for us to enjoy chinese food in china town. it is also not far away from bart station. sitting in the living room while enjoying the sunshine makes me feel relaxed. it is a little bit cold in the room. but if you have too many space heaters running you will trip the electricity circuit. it takes efforts to reset the electricity. \\r\\noverall, it is a good experience staying in jenny\\'s apartment. spacious apartment in the heart of chinatown - close to many tourist attractions such as the tram, coit tower and washington square gardens. \\r\\n\\r\\njenny was an excellent host with some great recommendations on what to do and see in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended - thanks for making us so welcome.had an amazing stay at this apartment. it was in a great location and was beautifully set up with plenty of amenities. jenny was communicative and a pleasure to work with.  four of us (adults) stayed here and it was just as it says... a walker\\'s paradise. we walked everywhere. you are very close (10 minute walk through stockton tunnell) to union square and it is also a lovely walk down to fisherman\\'s pier and the wharf area. we walked safely around the city and ate out in chinatown for dinner a few nights. \\r\\nhighly recommend the custard tarts from any chinese bakery shop anywhere on stockton st. \\r\\nthe welcome basket of wine and mineral water was appreciated although we didn\\'t drink the wine. \\r\\nthere are plenty of books and guides on san francisco to read and the internet access was great. \\r\\nbeds were very comfortable. bathroom very tiny. \\r\\na few noisy foot steps in the apartment upstairs. but never late at night so not too much of a bother. i think there was a small child who liked to run around.  \\r\\nno washing machine which is noted in the amenities list. we found a laundromat less than 2 blocks away. \\r\\nwe were able to check in a couple of hours early. jenny was very helpful and accommodating during the booking process, when we made several changes to the booking. the apartment was easy to find, and jenny sent clear instructions. on arrival, there were also instructions in the apartment with contact numbers and other useful bits of information. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was clean, the beds were comfortable and toiletries were provided. there is also wifi, although this only works in the living room, and a tv, with a few channels. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is located in the middle of chinatown, which is good for public transport and walking to places, but be aware it is often noisy and the apartment is not very soundproof (you can also hear neighbors from the floor above and below and the wooden floors seem to amplify everything within the apartment). \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was also cold on arrival and we couldn\\'t find any central heating, just an electric heater. fortunately the weather warmed up, otherwise this might have been a problem.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, jenny was very helpful, and the apartment is ok, but probably not if you are a light sleeper or visiting when the weather may be a bit chillier. the host was very responsive via email and also extremely accommodating and gracious, which was much appreciated. i didn\\'t see the place, as it was for my out-of-town colleagues coming in for a conference, but they said it was great except for the split bathroom. they said you could hardly get into the shower, that you almost had to open the apartment entry door (i.e., walk out of the apartment) in order to be able to properly open the door to the shower to get in. we had 4 men in the apartment, all of them very slim and trim, and all 4 voiced the same complaint, so it must be true. other than that, i\\'d say the place was perfect. thank you, jenny!two colleagues and i stayed at the apartment to attend a conference. we where very happy with our choice! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was very clean and tidy. the kitchen has everything you need even if you would want to make an extensive dinner. the bedrooms are of a good size and the mattresses weren\\'t bad either. the bathroom is a bit small and it can be difficult to get into the shower without opening the door to the kitchen. the wifi could use some improvements though because in the livingroom it often disconnected (a wifi repeater could do miracles). but when it works then you get a very fast connection. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is ideally located in sf. from there you can easily walk to the most important parts of town. if you need to go further or don\\'t want to walk then you can get on the cablecar within minutes. the chinese bakeries around the corner are great if you wan\\'t to get your breakfast or lunch for a very fair price. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe host was very responsive and accommodating. i always got responses within a day (mostly due to the time zone difference between europe and the u.s.). a couple of days before our arrive i got clear instructions on how to get to the apartment and how to get in the apartment (the electronic lock is awesome!).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only real annoyance that we had was from the noise from the upstairs neighbors. the first night we stayed in the appartement there was a lot of noise coming from above which only stopped around midnight. the other nights weren\\'t as bad but you could still hear noise now and then. except for the first night it didn\\'t disturb our sleep however.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will recommend this apartment and in the future i may stay there again.great place. terrific system for getting access and jenny was highly responsive both inside and outside. the only minor glitch was the wifi which tended to be slow and not working at times - everything else was great. i strongly recommend it. good location, nice and central. jenny was very accommodating. house was tidy, no issues staying again if we\\'re back in town :)jenny was the perfect host, check-in was a dream and we had all the amenities and support that we needed. the apartment was spotless! jenny had been so kind as to arrange us a portacot for our stay which was a huge help. we loved the location, chinatown is such fun and full of so many delicious food. we can\\'t wait to stay there again when we are next in san francisco.excellent location and the apartment was sparkling clean.  jenny made us feel very welcome with a basket including a welcome bottle of wine and sparkling water.  kitchen had both drip coffee machine and a nespresso machine generously stocked.  keyless entry (with code) was convenient and eliminated the risk of lost keys.  would stay again!\\r\\njenny was very accommodating and the unit was neat and clean. what it lacks in natural lighting it makes up in location. it\\'s very close to most things and if you don\\'t mind a walk over a hill or two, you can walk everywhere. jenny was always available by text and apart from the wireless being temperamental, the unit was what we wanted.\\nthanks jenny for a great stay\\ngos manuel and his family were very friendly. they let us see the apartment before we moved, presented us the area, gave us some tips for sf. they made us feel like we were at home. moreover, they were always in contact with us to find out if we needed anything, as well as we could contact them if we needed something and were could we find it. the neighbourhood was definitely one of the best ones we\\'ve seen in sf, very calm pacific, and we could find everything we needed in 5 or 10 min walking distance. we know that there is transportation to go were we studied, however as we were 3 we just preferred to get a taxi and share it between us since the price individually would be around the same as taking the muni.  \\r\\noverall it was a very good experience and recommend everyone to go if the apartment is available.we really enjoyed our four nights in manuel\\'s appartment. the location is indeed perfect with great restaurants, cafés and supermarkt round the corner. we can recommend the happy your arrangement at mama cita mexican restaurant. bicycle rental is a few blocks away and bus 30 to fisherman\\'s wharf and union square is nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe three bedroom, one bathroom appartment with separate living, dining and kitchen was exactly what we needed for our citytrip.carter is an extremely welcoming host! his knowledge of the area is extensive and his room made me feel at home.this place is fantastic!! 5 stars for sure! laurine was such a brilliant host!! gave us incredible recommendations on places to eat and things to do. very personable and super friendly! we enjoyed our stay in sf because of them!\\r\\ni absolutely love this location and the view was amazing! the amenities are some of the very best you will experience in sf. space is central to lots of great restaurants and shopping, walking distance to moscone center. this is the perfect match of the hotel experience and feeling at home in a luxury space. laurine is a great host, i wish we could of spent more time together. i had plenty of personal space but felt very welcomed like an old friend visiting. i look forward to staying here again.i stayed with a friend at laurine\\'s place for about a week and we had a wonderful time there! the roommates are so friendly and kind, so that we felt very welcome. the view is fabulous!!! and the whole place is very luxurious. relaxing in the hot tub, working out at the gym, chilling on the rooftop and enjoying the fantastic view of san francisco. our room was very comfortable (i miss the bed! so comfy :-) ) and everything was tidy and clean. the people are so relaxed - we always had our privacy and the same time there was always the chance to ask, if we had any questions. we all together even went out for a nice goodbye-dinner on our last night! hopefully we can welcome these guys at our place in london one day. this place is very much recommended!this is a review for their apartment at 10th street with miles as the host. i booked with laurine, but she double booked the room so she gave me a room at a different building. the gave me a nice discount to make up for it. the biggest issue was cleanliness. for a $50 cleaning fee, the bathroom was very filthy. when i got up one morning the entire apartment smelled absolutely terrible. i had to leave as soon as i woke up it was so bad. when i brought my colleague to see the view, the host was uncomfortable and directed us to the terrace outside which didn\\'t have a view of city hall. the host offered me a scanner which was nice, but didn\\'t work. there is a business center, a nice workout room, a great heated pool, and a wonderful view. greats hosts! five stars. stunning penthouse apartment with exceptional bay views over sf in a cool area of the city. comfortable bedroom with ensuite with plenty of room. i was travelling with work and they made sure i felt at home and were super friendly - plus provided great advice on places to see and explore within the city, including phils coffee cafe which is a must for any coffee lovers. highly recommended laurine was very nice and she\\'s a great host! she made sure that we are comfortable and happy at her place. she will got he extra mile to make sure that you will a great experience. the view was really amazing!!! nice room and hosts, convenient location in soma.clean and comfortable space.laurine was a wonderful host!  my girlfriend and i were staying in the city for a night and she was very accommodating.  she was able to greet us at a convenient time and walked us in to her amazing apartment where we would be staying.  my girlfriend was absolutely in love with the view and has already asked about the next time we can go back and stay.  thanks for everything laurine :)laurine and yohann were great hosts and the place was perfect. it was spotless the whole time i was there. i highly recommend it. great deal.laurine\\'s listing is great, with a beautiful view of the ballpark.  the room and closet are super spacious with a great private bathroom as well.  communication was very easy and prompt!my host laurine was very friendly, and helpful during my whole stay. she made me feel very welcome, providing support with necessary (i.e. there was a typo in the wifi password from the house manual, which she helped figure out to get connected.) she was also great at providing privacy, and also enjoying a good conversation, at times when we both felt like talking. the property itself is nice, in a good location, although the picture in the listing seems to reflect another unit in the same floor and building. the unit i was in overlooked the at&t park and the bay, offering a view of gorgeous sunrises.it\\'s a nice apartment, minimalistic, clean and our host was welcoming too. we could be on our own and had access to the kitchen and living space. however, the photos are not of the unit we stayed in, and the space is not \\'luxurious\\' so to say. the view is beautiful on the other hand. overall we would recommend it, but we think it is pricy.laurine was a fantastic host. we absolutely loved our experience. and next time we\\'re in the bay area, we\\'ll definitely check there first.my stay was excellent, the neighborhood was very close to downtown and accessible to lots of different things. laurine was very welcoming and very friendly and also gave great tips on things to see and do in town. the views were amazing, simply an awesome stay in san fran!great first time experience using airbnb. laurel was a great host & i can\\'t wait to visit again!perfect stay! spectacular view of the skyline and city lights. the view of the bay bridge at night and the ball park was a sure sight to see. laure was very accommodating. private bedroom and bathroom was more than enough with a view so spectacular! don\\'t think twice on this penthouse. gym was amazing. laure was a wonderful host. very accommodating and allowed me to keep to myself when i needed to. the house was very comfortable and the view was spectacular. i honestly can\\'t recommend staying here enough. laure was very flexible and easy to communicate with! she welcomed my husband and i into her home and made sure we had everything we needed. the place was very clean and the bed was comfortable! thanks, laure!the view from the shared living room is stunning, and the location was perfect for me. the private bedroom was a bit small but the private bathroom was excellent. laure and her housemate miles were very friendly and did everything to ensure a smooth arrival and stay including great restaurant tips. so i would highly recommend staying there. of course, if you like complete privacy the shared living room may not be your thing, but i actually very much liked the social aspect of that.great host with very helpful suggestions on local shops and restaurants. impeccable place, great view of the bay. the location is super convenient with easy access to everything you need. overall a great experience, will definitely stay again. \\r\\n\\r\\nwow. this place has set a new bar for how airbnbs should be run! outstanding views, lovely amenities (i mean... have you ever watched \"game of thrones\" on a projector with the city in the background? i hadn\\'t but now nothing will compare, haha), super friendly hosts - this place was perfect. i would go back in a heartbeat and i recommend it to anyone.dagmar was great. her place was gorgeous. its in a fantastic location and the interior is stunning. it was like living in the pages of kinfolk magazine! i would easily stay here again. dagmars place is hands down the nicest airbnb i have ever stayed in.i booked this apartment for my family who were visiting san francisco for 8 days.  justin was awesome from the get-go.  he allowed us to come by the apartment before booking it so we could check out the space, and made sure to check in during their stay to make sure everything was going well.   the apartment was clean and well laid out on a quiet side street away from the noise.  the location is excellent - you are steps away from so many transportation options, and short walking distance from lower haight, castro, upper market/duboce neighborhoods, with hayes valley and mission a little further out.  i\\'d certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a temporary home in sf.justin was awesome - so friendly, warm and helpful. his place was beautiful, in a perfect location that really gave you the quintessential san francisco experience. you\\'re right down the street from a lovely park and an awesome cafe (duboce cafe) that had some of the best french toast i\\'ve ever had.justin was a great host. the house is very nice and the location was close to restaurants, grocery stores and public transportation.myself and 2 colleagues stayed at justin\\'s apartment as an alternative to a city hotel and were really happy with our decision. fantastic, spacious and well-appointed house. situated on a quiet street in an great neighbourhood, far enough from the city to have a suburban vibe but close enough to walk to most points of interest if you enjoy walking. justin made things easy and was very welcoming. would definitely stay again. recommended.jessica\\'s place was perfect for our stay in the bay area.  it is conviently located and has everything we need for our stay.  there are more than enough room of all five of us, with 3 bedrooms and 2 bath. we enjoy our stay in jessica\\'s place.  thank you for sharing your house with us. the house and the garden are great. our kids were very happy to find so much toys ! the neighborhood is nice and you can find easily all what you want around, \\r\\nwe had a wonderful stay in jessica\\'s home! roomy and charming in a great sf neighborhood, it was exactly what we were looking for. our young girls enjoyed the books and toys. the house is well-stocked with the comforts of home, and there is a whole foods market within walking distance. driveway parking was handy as street parking can be tough.  jessica was a wonderful hostess. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe hope this great house is available the next the we visit!jessica was a pleasure to work with and made it simple to coordinate arrival and departure details. \\xa0the lock box was handy, as members of our group of 5 arrived at different times throughout the week. \\xa0location was convenient; whole foods nearby was a plus. \\xa0downtown and public transit both within short distance. \\xa0we enjoyed the two living rooms. \\xa0kitchen was fun to cook in. overall, we had everything we needed and a very pleasant stay. \\xa0we highly recommend booking through jessica for future travels.\\xa0loved our vacation stay in this place!!..\\narmando & laura made sure to accommodate everything for my family & i. (family of 7)\\nclean, comfortable beach front home.\\nwe will definitely be coming back to this beautiful home..\\nthank you armando &laura :)great place. lovely host.our stay was great! the house clean and well maintained as described. the location was also great to enjoy san francisco fully. thanks loura! laura was very responsible weeks before my travels began. when we checked in her father was there to warmly welcome us to their beautiful home. the home was equipped with all the essentials we needed to make our long weekend stay comfortable. we loved the location, which is steps away from the beach, a stroll to golden gate park, and less than a 10 minute drive to the sf zoo. highly recommended!a lovely home in a very cool california-style beach neighborhood.  literally across the street from the beach but a large dune obscures the view of the water.  i\\'d still love to live there.   and for those who are good at public transportation, there\\'s a cool electric on-rail modern trolley that connects to the rest of the massive \"muni\" system including the cable cars. for the short, two day stay we had, we thought it somewhat inconvenient to all the typical tourist attractions. but we\\'d go back in a heartbeat if we had a week or two.we enjoyed the nice little home across the street from the beach.  we enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and the local shops and restaurants.  i would definitely recommend staying here.  there are two items i feel i should mention; the nice oven prominently displayed in the pictures does not work and the patio area shown in the pictures is shared with the people staying below you.loved our stay at this house.  in a nice vibrant neighborhood that had easy to find parking, access to public transportation steps away, great restaurants in walking distance.  the house was very nice, provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would not hesitate to stay here againlaura was responsive to our needs and even permitted us to check in a bit early so we could get rolling on our family\\'s first visit to san francisco.  awesome location allowed for easy access to the beach for our 4 children and grandma.  coffee shops, grocery store within an easy walk. immediately accessible to muni lines that run every 10 minutes to downtown and easy bike ride/jog to land\\'s end and golden gate park.  interior of apartment had plenty of cozy spaces and comfortable beds.  would stay here again. excelent! very nice place and great hosts!i had a great experience staying here & met very interesting fellow travellers. the place was very clean & well organised & equipped, and the ocean view from the breakfast / dining room was awesome - really glad i picked this place to stay in sf!we were welcomed by the owner who explained things around and gave us the keys. she had already communicated with us and geve us lots of tips and recommendations. we immediatly felt like home. the condo is trully outstanding, beautifully decorated with modern furniture and everything needed to live like at home. the place has a lot of light and the views of the city are amazing from every window and from the roof terrace. there were 3 huge bedrooms and 3 beautiful bathrooms that slept the 6 of us very comfortably. the location could not be more perfect, in the heart of the castro, walking distance to mission, cole valley, heigh/ashbury and only one block away from the muni, which took us directly to the financial district in 10 minutes. it is the perfect spot to explore the beauty of san francisco. there were a lot of restaurants and bars in the neighborhood, as well as great scenery walks all aroud. we did not need a car at all, as walking and public transportation took us everywhere. i would highly recommend this place to have the best experience exploring san francisco in luxury but feeling like a local.the host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.wow, this is one of the most relaxing, special places i\\'ve ever stayed, which is a rare find in a congested city like san francisco. the house is close to everything, but you\\'d think you were in the woods once you get inside the gate and see the grounds.\\r\\nthe house itself is very roomy, gorgeous high ceilings, and every modern convenience. the master has beautiful views of downtown from both bedroom and shower. there is a fabulous tv/ rumpus room/ man cave downstairs, and 2 full bedrooms on the main level, \\r\\nthe outside is like a wooded glen hideaway- relax in the hot tub, or eat your meals outside. super easy going and friendly hosts. you won\\'t want to leave!the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.the property was a great place to stay.  the owner, nick, was easy to contact and very understanding/accommodating.  the place itself was great.   beautiful, spacious and a great location.  would definitely come back here for my next trip to san francisco. nick is a great host , he offered us a lot of tips about living and traveling in s.f. the house is very nice , the sofabed in the living room is amazing , you can lay down watching the sunrise of s.f. the house is located in nob hill , so it only takes within 20mins walking to fishman wharf , coit tower ,north beach and union square ! highly recommended!nick was great!  this was my first time using airbnb and nick made the experience perfect!  great information about local area.  this listing is exactly as the pictures depict - even better!  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe entire place has been wonderfully updated inside, and the views are just phenomenal.  we needed a place for 3 couples, and this is perfect - 3 bedrooms with queen beds and soft sheets and warm comforters, and 3 full bathrooms, all updated extremely well. plus, the living room is nice and open with plenty of seating, and the well-appointed kitchen is open to the dining room and living room.  great for a big family like ours to hang out all together. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe rent in sf quite often, and this is the best place we\\'ve ever stayed.  plus, we just turned the heat up a few degrees and it was nice and toasty - no drafts, no cold feet.  this is the only apartment in san francisco where i\\'ve ever been warm!  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is great, too!  cute coffee shops and restaurants all within walking distance, and an adorable nail salon right across the street (juicy nails).  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe owners - melissa and nick - were incredibly responsive and easy to get in touch with.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou absolutely cannot go wrong staying here. we will definitely be back!we received a phone call from nick who was traveling in europe  -- to give us our security code instructions -- and to say hi! his wife followed up with another contact and to answer any of our questions. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is in a wonderful neighborhood -- with a beautiful view and easy access to the traditional cable cars, and even the cable car museum. by the way, that is a must see! there is a small cafe for a quick bite to eat, and a small asian food market which was able to satisfy our ice cream needs. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is on the third floor, up a steep winding stairwell. this made moving our luggage somewhat difficult. however, upon reaching the top you can really appreciate the beauty and view of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks nick!

\\r\\nspecial thanks to max! he is great landlord.one word: wow. i use airbnb often and this was the best place i\\'ve ever stayed at.  it looks exactly like the pictures and is a rare large/modern/open/well-priced gem in a place like sf.  all the latest and greatest amenities, beautiful huge loft, perfect location, amazing terrace, etc.  christa was a pleasure and went above and beyond to provide a superior experience. would def stay at again!the host canceled this reservation 49 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this is the best quality airbnb had to offer. the place is amazing, in the middle of town, has a great rooftop and is super clean; large, well fitted out, it delivers on all fronts and the price is great value. if you\\'re in san fran? do yourself a favour, stay here. the space was amazing. very well designed and nicely furnished/stocked. great private outdoor patio & garden. comfortable bed. beautiful bathroom. our host was easily accessible, friendly, and thorough. we would book again in a heartbeat. absolutely no complaints.christa was an absolute pleasure to work with.  she answered all my pre-booking questions promptly, and kept up communications before and during my stay.\\r\\n\\r\\ni didn\\'t need much \"hosting\", as i was familiar with the area, but i was definitely aware that i would be able to reach her if need be.our stay at christa\\'s apartment was nothing short of fantastic. we had very high expectations of our stay here and these were all met and much more. staff were all very friendly and obliging to our every request going above and beyond our expectations. we arrived earlier than check in time but christa kindly allowed us to check in upon arrival - no charge.   the apartment is centrally located, easy access to all transport and walking distance to all that union square and beyond has to offer.\\r\\nif we had to rate this apartment out of 10 we\\'d give it a 12!! exactly as described in the listing. thank you to christa, karleen and all the staff. would come back here again in a heartbeat.one of the best airbnb places that i have stayed! the place is exactly as described and a very central location. the perfect spot to fit 3 people comfortably. the rooftop is a great amenity and the indoor space is gorgeous. it\\'s located on the top floor of a hotel so you may also enjoy the hotel amenities. lisa was very sweet, the room is clean and big and got a really good night view. she left us a care package and it\\'s been really helpful !! the place is in downtown and really close to union square, chinatown, ferry building etc etc... this is a really good place to stay when visiting san francisco. both the host and the room are fantastic!!! since it was my first time in san francisco and first time user of airbnb i was stressed at first, but as soon as my fiancé and i made contact by phone with lisa we knew we had made the right choice. lisa was a perfect host! she was easy to talk to and was always happy to help.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had to attend to a several day event in moscone center and her house was at most a 15 minutes walk (normal pace). my fiancé had lots of fun with lisa and the location of her home is very convenient! (close from: moscone center, ferry building, piers, at&t park, ... as well as a 2 minutes walk from the bart transportation that gets us basically anywhere in sf!!) in short, the location is perfect!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is beautiful, very clean and has a great view. the room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable (it felt like home). we had a dedicated closet in the bedroom and our own bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nlisa is a wonderful person full of life and very cheerful, she was always there to help us with our visiting plans and even suggested us some great places to see. she helped us with some great shopping places and good restaurants!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe would definitively stay at lisa’s home again when visiting san francisco!!! elizabeth was the best host ever! the space is absolutely beautiful and very convenient to anywhere you would want to be in sf. i have stayed many times and will continue to do so whenever it is available.elizabeth was a perfect host as always! makes being away from home for long periods of time much easier and much more enjoyable than staying in a hotel!katy\\'s home was awesome and just as described in airbnb.  when we arrived, the home was neat and clean and the amazingly comfortable  bed was freshly made.  katy left very nice welcoming notes for us, hersheys kisses, and a bottle of wine for us to enjoy.  the balcony was the perfect place for wine, cheese, bread and a greta view - we watched fireworks one night from the balcony.  sweet!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe flat was near shopping and restaurants and just a short drive from the city center.  to buy grocerier, we walked lass than 5 minutes to an awesome food boutique that out-did trader joe\\'s and whole foods.\\r\\n\\r\\nlike everywhere in the city, parking our rental car on the san francisco streets was tough but we figured it out.  i would recommend future airbnb guests to not rent a car, but rather take the bart from the airport, and use uber cabs.  \\r\\n\\r\\nkaty was very communicative throughout the application process and during our stay.  she was available by phone and email at all times whenever we had a question - and she got us the right answers quickly.  katy is a perfect airbnb host.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you plan a getaway to san franciso, katy\\'s place would be the perfect place and perfect location for a romantic stay in san francisco.  we would stay there agin the next time we vist san francisco.this was my first airbnb trip, and it was great. katy was friendly and helpful. she made me feel at home, more like a friend than a customer. the house was very comfy and pretty, and in a great location. i highly recommend staying here.katy is a fabulous host. the home is in a phenomenal location and the photos are accurate. would highly recommend checking it out we had a fantastic time staying at sam\\'s loft. the pictures just don\\'t do it justice... it\\'s an incredible space with lots of flexibility. a group of us stayed and ate meals there, worked, held some meetings, watched movies, etc. sam was incredibly responsive and happy to offer his recommendations for the neighborhood and great places to check out. we would definitely stay again!we had a fantastic time at the space. sam was more than helpful when we arrived, made himself available throughout our entire stay, and even went as far as providing nearby restaurant recommendations in the middle of our stay. the space is impeccable and eclectic, and served as a perfect retreat for our group. would absolutely recommend the place again and again.the apartment exceeded our expectations. it looks better than on the pictures. the interior designer did a fantastic job!\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are tons of restaurants and shops in the area. i enjoyed the bakery downstairs the most:  nothing beats the smell of fresh bread and pastries in the morning when you step out of the apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe rented sam\\'s apartment during a tradeshow visit in san francisco. hotel room prices were soaring and i decided to save our startup some money by renting an apartment instead of spending 20k on hotel rooms. we didn\\'t just save money, but also got a lot more value. the place was extremely clean, the two bathrooms are very modern, the beds had high-end mattresses, the kitchen is fully equipped and the home automation and entertainment system fulfills all your wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe five of us stayed for a week. the place felt like home, especially after very long days of work it was great to come back to the apartment and relax. even the guys on my team who usually travel a lot enjoyed it more than the usual hilton rooms. \\r\\n\\r\\ni can highly recommend the place and will most likely stay again during our next visit to san francisco.i booked the house for four of my executives for a local work event that was taking place.  they found the house to be in perfect condition and very clean.  the amenities met every expectation they had.  the owner was a pleasure to work with and answered any questions promptly.  we look forward to renting the house again in the future.sam is one of the best hosts i\\'ve had the chance to meet. he was incredibly helpful, communicative & flexible. his space is perfect -- exactly as described, both functional + beautifully designed. we already have another stay on the books w/sam!we had a wonderful experience.  sam was friendly, punctual, and accommodating.  the place is quite large, the decor is dazzlingly creative, and the location is perfect.  staying here would make anyone\\'s visit to san francisco a good deal more fun and inspiring.  this place is absolutely incredible.  the place is soooo cool.   we rented this place for three lawyers who were in the city for work and needed three separate bedrooms.  i was a  little nervous about having the managing partner of our law firm stay there but he loved it.  very fun and neat place to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nsam is a great host and the whole experience was fantastic.we absolutely loved using sam\\'s amazing loft for our team meeting! it is such a unique listing - modern, plenty of space and a variety of great amenities that made our 3 day stay even more enjoyable. sam was extremely helpful - always checking in and close by if we needed anything. thanks for a great stay! sam\\'s wife greeted us & she could not be more helpful .this has to be one of the most unique and noteworthy homes in all of san francisco. i can honestly say, after having reviewed thousands of homes on airbnb as one of the founders, that this is one of the most uniquely designed homes on our platform in the world. sam and his family have created an amazing experience here. the design speaks for itself in the photos. it feels like stepping into an eclectic avante garde art gallery installation in the mission. what is not visible in photos is how comfortable the home is. its much more comfy than the photos portray. the entire home is digitally connected, so you can easily control the lighting, and all of the tvs and speakers are networked together. great for movies or events. the location is amazing, and the house sits on top of a very popular bakery. though this isn\\'t the cheapest home in sf by a long shot, the experience is very memorable.we used the loft for a photo shoot and it was perfect. the loft is a nice size and has good amenities however, it\\'s location and mostly its decor make it pretty great. it\\'s refreshing to see decor that extends beyond the expected. for the photo shoot the access was good with a rear lane and only one small set of stairs. no issues with power. thanks to sam for accommodating us. sam\\'s loft is one of the most unique spaces in the city - we absolutely love using it for our working meetings. not only is is spacious, modern, and superbly decorated, but sam is a wonderful host. he is always available to answer any questions and make sure that our stay is going well. i would recommend this listing in a heartbeat! sam and his wife were amazing hosts! we held a working meeting in his wonderful home, and everything went flawlessly. i\\'d highly recommend it for anyone looking for an amazing a/v experience during their stay. the location is also great and the photos are extremely representative of the home\\'s unique decor. i\\'ve already booked this property again for another event in may, and i can\\'t wait to come back!this listing is unbelievable!  it is so beautifully designed and such a unique home.  it\\'s also close to so many great restaurants and bars in the mission.  also, sam is the ultimate host! he is very communicative and so welcoming and walked me through everything i needed to know about the home. i really can\\'t recommend this list enough!sam is extremely easy to work with - he goes above and beyond to make sure our group has the best stay. we have used this space for working team offsites many times in the past and each time the group has a great experience. the space itself is spacious, modern, and clean  - one of the most unique listings in the city! beautiful space with impeccable attention to detail. it was a real treat to stay there, it\\'s like sleeping in a cool art gallery. sam was a great host and went out of his way several times to make sure we were having a nice stay. highly recommended. sam is an incredibly responsive host with an amazing home! we had a wonderful off-site there and will definitely book it again in the future.i have to say, this place is even more stunning than its pictures! the decor was unreal and i have never stayed in a home as unique and amazing as this place!\\r\\n\\r\\nsam was so accommodating to our schedule and was very responsive to all of our questions prior to check-in. he gave us a thorough tour of the space and its history and made sure we had everything we needed before he left. sam\\'s a great host and i hope we get the opportunity to stay at the mission loft again!loft was great for our corporate meeting. the location was terrific. sam was the perfect host and made us feel very welcome. his home is in a wonderful part of town and i would recommend this place for anyone traveling for business or vacation. sam is a thoughtful host with an amazing listing! we used it for a two day offsite and everything went off without a hitch. the space was big enough for a group and the projector made for very smooth presentations! thanks, sam! great place in a great location.  sam was very helpful in answering all of my questions, and continued to help my guests and i with our questions about the house/area when he was out of town. sam is a great host and this place is just perfect for a team offsite or any get together for that matter. great location and so cool. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again sam for always being so great :) the place was fabulous and perfect for a small family 60th birthday celebration. we booked sam\\'s awesome loft for business trip - he was super informative prior to booking and extra helpful answering our questions. my clients loved the space and we would definitely rent from sam again. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was a great stay andsam was there to welcome me and give me all the information i needed. he was also accessible during the stay in case i needed anything. i can honestly say i didn\\'t want to give the keys back. the loft provided a very comfortable experience. sam gives you a deep dive walk through and provided a manual for you to navigate the loft and neighborhood. this place also has everything you need. i don\\'t think i\\'ve had a better stay at an airbnb will be recommendingthe apartment was just as beautiful and surprising as listed. sam was also extremely accommodating.  the apartment really made our event special and perfect.  thank you!the loft was amazing! it was very clean and 100% ready for our arrival. it is a high quality place with both a fun and sophisticated sense of style. we will define fly book it again. every single room was great, including the kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms, even the closet! sam did a great job walking me through the place and providing a spiral bound booklet of everything i might need to know such as wifi access. it was a completely positive experience.the pictures are just the beginning! we loved the energy of this place, the location, the beds, the artwork, et cetera. would do it again and probably will.sam was great, met me at the loft, very friendly, informative and welcoming.  an absolutely stunning space; what fun! the hosts were easy to get in touch with and very helpful. the mission area is wonderful with lots of interesting shops and small eclectic restaurants. highly recommended.yes, everything was great. sam was a great host and we absolutely loved his place.  it was a pleasure and i\\'d highly recommend this location.natasha and tess are great hosts. communication and responses were fast, effortless and friendly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe room is very nice with a comfortable memory mattress bed. it also possibly offers some of the best views you can find in sf! it will be at the top of my list when i come to sf next time. probably one of the best view of the city.\\r\\nan really unique experience in a high quality house.\\r\\nnice people.\\r\\nnatasha and her partner were very friendly and assist me with my doubts, prior and during my stay. the description is totally accurate for the room with this impressive view from the bay, very clean and nice. this was my first business trip using the service which makes me consider for the next time, and for sure this room when visiting sf next time.it was amazing to stay with natasha! her house is everything and more i could have expected. her and tess were the most amazing hosts and made me feel right at home on my business trip! given the opportunity, i would definitely stay with them again. it was the most amazing view and very comfortable. natasha\\'s house is beautiful! the pictures do not do it justice. the bedroom is perfect, big and clean, with a big private bathroom. but the view from the room is breathtaking. you can see everything in sf and surrounding areas. natasha is an amazing host, very easy to communicate with, very friendly and polite. i would stay at natasha\\'s again and again. highly recommended! staying at natasha\\'s house was the best way i could imagine spending time in san francisco. it\\'s located at the top of a hill with incredible views of the city. the house itself has such a good feel to it. it was as if i could subsist entirely on clementines, yoga, and coffee for months upon years - a relaxing oasis just apart from the center of the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nyou\\'re a short walk away from the panhandle and golden gate park. great neighborhood. even better hosts. i\\'d stay here again in a second if ever i make it back up to sf. natasha and tess were most gracious hosts and most accommodating.  very considerate of their guest in allowing for privacy.  the master suite is indeed as advertised, with breathtaking day and night views of the city, and a most lovely house they have, simple yet elegant.  a most enjoyable stay!for those who might be hesitant to stay in a home that has \"common\" areas ... i.e., kitchen, living room ... fear not at this abode!  we admittedly had a few concerns (we\\'ve never done this before) but those concerns immediately melted away.\\r\\nnatasha and her partner, tess, were extremely sensitive to our \"private time\" needs ... yet magically were around whenever we wanted to socialize.  \\r\\ntheir home sits on a lot that has unbelievable views of sf and is so very convenient to the medical center.  no steps to get in or out of this home .. a real plus for us.  the home has been recently been remodeled and is drop-dead gorgeous!  if you\\'re a photography buff .. natasha has some wonderful work on their walls ... who ever thought poloriod and infra-red could be so striking!  \\r\\nboth natasha and tess were most accommodating with our ridiculous schedule ... and we will always be so grateful.\\r\\nwe will have to go back to ucsf frequently .. and if they are available .. we\\'ll be knocking at their door!the reservation was canceled 26 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this was a beautiful home and i hope to return in the future. natasha wasn\\'t there; her partner tess showed us the place and was always available by text to answer questions. the views from the windows overlooking the bay are awe inspiring. the view, the house and the location are fantastic!!!!!!!! we were more than overwhelmed!!!tess made us feel at home from the beginning to the end, thank you for this wonderful experience in this one of a kind town!!!!my experience with natasha was excellent!  the master suite was as described - clean, comfortable and very private with a fabulous view of the city!   natasha was very available to advise us with transportation, etc.  we found the lyft service extremely efficient in securing rides, plus we love to walk, and it was a downhill walk to lovely cafes in a beautiful neighborhood.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend staying with natasha, and look forward to a return trip.  first experience whit airbnb and it was just amazing. this house is in one of the highest point from sf. wiew is just awesome ! big bay windows in the room and in the living room with this wiew. many people get on twin peaks to see it, so take a chance to get the same wiew in your hosting house ! \\r\\nneighbourhood was quiet and really cool.\\r\\nnatasha was very discreet during the 2 days and available to welcome us during our arrival.\\r\\nwe can only recommend this place and share this view and place.\\r\\nwe use the both rooms (one had more space as the other) but they have same confort.our stay was very pleasant.  the view was outstanding and the furnishings were clean and comfortable. natasha was very friendly and the house was quiet.  the bed was comfy, the water was warm and the parking was simple. we would recommend  this arrangement for anyone visiting san francisco.natasha and her place were awesome all around!! she greeted us warmly when we arrived and gave us a walk through of the magnificent area. the view truly is breathtaking and all the amenities were top notch including the shower head in the ensuite which was amazing! many thanks to natasha for being an excellent host! staying with natasha was absolutely perfect. the house was so modern and gorgeous, and the view was breathtaking! we couldn\\'t have asked for a prettier place to stay. natasha was incredibly welcoming, helpful and nice. we will definitely book this room the next time we\\'re in san francisco, we couldn\\'t have been happier. thank you natasha!natasha was a fantastic host. \\nthe view. from the rooms are outstanding. you are on top of sf and have a view down to whole sf and goldengate bridge\\ni recommend to use a rental car otherwise it might be too far to city. by car about 10min.\\nthe reservation was canceled 40 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we had a wonderful time at natasha\\'s home. it was perfect! breathtaking views and felt our room was very private and cozy. awesome home and lovely hosts.natasha was a great host and gave excellent suggestions on restaurants and areas to visit. the room we stayed in was beautiful with an unbeatable view of the city. the house very clean and tidy. we would love to stay there again next time we visit the city.natasha was very welcoming and communicative!  i wish i would\\'ve stayed longer to chat and get to know her more.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe listing is clean and well managed, and the views of the city are really cool! \\r\\n\\r\\nwe stayed at this place during the month of july while attending a solar convention at moscone convention center which was 20 min driving distance. we really enjoyed our stay at this place. it was clean, simple, practical, with convenient private parking. this unit is footsteps away from many authentic japanese, vietnamese, and chinese and mediterranean restaurants which people drove across town to come to because of quality of the food and being inexpensive. footsteps away from groceries. 7 min drive away from stonetown shopping mall. literally 5 min walking distance to golden gate park. 15 to 20 min drive to union square and fisherman\\'s whorf. we will consider staying at this place again. \\n\\nthanks to rani and rocky to check up on us during our stay making sure everything was going well. it was a pleasure meeting rani who lived upstairs of this unit. she was knock away if we needed anything. we said hi to rocky, introduced ourselves. contact was minimal. the apartment was better than we expected but met all of our needs. open living room and kitchen. we found rocky\\'s place to be very spacious and clean. it\\'s within walking distance from golden gate park as well as many local eateries. the apartment has everything one needs to enjoy their stay. highly recommended for families needing a good amount of space or groups of up to five people.rocky was incredibly helpful, friendly, and accommodating. the rooms and amenities were just as described, if not better. access to a garage space was key for a city with limited parking. highly recommended for groups of 4-5 who want the feel of staying in a home and not a hotel. rocky was a great host. his place was perfect for my coworkers and myself for a business trip!we had a great experience at this house in south san francisco. it was cleanly, roomy and well equipped with a great kitchen. the house was in a great location with plenty of local restaurants within walking distance and located within walking distance to golden gate park. overall we had a great experience and we enjoyed our stay. highly recommended.\\r\\nrocky was waiting for us when we got to the house. courteous and helpful with questions that we had. the place clean and presented well as advertised. we\\'ve never been to this part of sf before so we were pleasantly suprised with the proximity to great ethnic food and the park. our arrival was easy. rocky\\'s mom met us in the hallway and showed us to the apartment. plenty of space for three people to sleep, work and relax (we stayed for seven days). the apartment was clean and had all of the amenities that were listed. the neighborhood was quiet which was nice, but a bit of a hike to get downtown everyday. the big down side was some confusion with the checkout time which resulted in being rushed out and some of our belongings being left behind and tossed. my friends and i (group of 6) had a great time staying here. rocky\\'s listing and house rules are really clear and easy to understand, and everything was accurately stated. he was proactive about ensuring everything was smooth and comfortable for us. wifi speed/connection wasn\\'t that great out in living room. \\r\\n\\r\\nit is mostly a residential neighborhood, but there was plenty of chinese/asian food within close walking distance. not too much non-asian food available. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was great (almost unheard of) that there were 2 parking spaces available for us. we didn\\'t use them though and used uber/lyft instead to get elsewhere in the city. rocky and his mom were very good with communication.  the place was in a quiet neighborhood.  although we have two boys, noise was never an issue... either from other units, or from ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was right next to golden gate park, which was exactly what we were looking for.  perfect for a day of exploring on our scooters (or bikes).our family had a pleasant visit in rocky\\'s house. apartment was very clean and had everything we needed, and it was just as we expected it to be. there was just enough room for my family (5 persons)\\n\\narea was nice and peaceful, and park was just around the corner. i recommend this place! 10 out of 10! we had the best stay ever! we would love to be rocky\\'s guest again if we find ourselves back in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nrocky is a very accommodating host and very fast to respond to our questions. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is great, a short walk to golden gate park, lots of asian restaurants (particularly vietnamese and chinese) and very close to bus stops and light rail stops. we love the little chinese bubble tea place around the corner!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe property is wonderful. whilst it isn\\'t the most modern looking apartment, it is very well thought out and equipped with everything we could possibly need. it is really one of the most well equipped places we have stayed in. plenty of bedding, towels, toiletries, toilet rolls and boxes of facial tissues. shower is hot with good water pressure. kitchen is a joy to use - big fridge, dishwasher, oven, cooker, microwave, knives, pots and pans, and lots of tablewear. we really appreciated little things like bin liners and kitchen towels. cooking oil, salt and pepper are also provided. the washer-dryer in the garage is nice and big.\\r\\n\\r\\nif we had to criticise something, it would be that the rooms are on the small side. we were 6 big adults and it felt a little cramped - for example not enough room for us all to sit around watching tv in the living room on the sofa/arm chair. if you were a close family and willing to all cuddle up together, then you would fit. shower is definitely for 1 person only - not enough room for romantic couple shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nstay! you won\\'t regret it!we\\'ve spent here 4 fantastic weeks and we had such a good feeling in this place! it\\'s awesome, very clean, spacious with all kind of amenities, great location.\\r\\n\\r\\nrocky was a super host, very friendly and always available for any kind help required.  we already miss it so much and when we come back to san francisco this is where we would always want to stay! \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks for everything rocky!great place, good value, nice host!\\nthis place is great! high speed internet, good location, nice kitchen, and amazing room. it\\'s very clean with a lot of clean towels. u can walk to golden gate park. there are also have many stores around you, like whole food, chinese restaurant, thai restaurant, rocky is a nice host, and he will reply you message fast. easy to communicate. good!!traveling with 3 teenagers it was perfect for our needs and it was well equipped.great place with a good location. quiet and comfortable with everything you need in the apartment. plenty of shops and fast food restaurants nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\ninstructions were clear and easy to follow. rocky got in touch over our stay to make sure everything was ok - a great host.literally a very nice cozy home with all the amenities from home!  located on quite neighborhood and at the end of the street is a quite a bit of shops and markets.  this was the first time for my family to visit san francisco and especially our first time to stay in another place  besides a hotel.  we didn\\'t meet with rocky personally but did talk too and kept in touch with him and made everything easy as possible.  we did however get to meet with his mother who was very nice and help us out when ever we had any questions.  plus she always had a smile on her face and made us feel very at home.  although we mostly stayed in the apartment to catch some z\\'s this 3 bedroom apartment is beautiful and accommodated 6 people easily.  thank you rocky for an awesome stay :)this place was amazing! spacious and comfy. very good location - close to restaurants, supermarket, and public transportation. includes parking spot which was helpful as sf street parking is always a nightmare. would highly recommend!! :)the place was great! just like the pictures, easy access, friendly greeting. great spot. we\\'ve had a great stay. the apartment is clean and fresh. location was just perfect for our parents because they could spend their time in the countless supermarkets and the gorgeous park even without our company. i\\'ll definitely recommend this place to everyone. we enjoyed very much our stay.  the apartment was clean, warm and quiet.  the parking space, laundry and overall set up suited our needs perfectly.  rocky and rani were wonderful hosts!  neighborhood was very nice and amenities such as restaurants and markets readily available.  my wife, \\r\\ndaughter and i give this listing a hearty thumbs up! \\r\\nronthe information exchange with rocky was smooth and thorough. check in was smooth, as was checkout. instructions for checkout were posted and clear. the apartment was super comfortable, and provided with all we needed. the neighborhood was great, n-judah only a block away, golden gate park also one block away!\\r\\nthanks, rocky!beschreibung der wohnung, einrichtung und umgebung entsprachen der anzeige. super saubere und ruhige wohnung mit einem pkw stellplatz (2. stellplatz ist leicht zu finden). schlüsselübergabe hat wie vereinbart funktioniert. bei geringem verkehr keine 20 min. bis fisherman\\'s warf.\\r\\n\\r\\ndescription of flat, equipment and neighbourhood are totaly correct. very clean flat and quite place. one parking place for the car, 2. place easy to find. timing to keep the key works perfect. only 20 minutes to fisherman\\' warf if low traffic.\\r\\nthis was our first airbnb stay and it couldn\\'t have gone better! this is a great space in a great location, in good shape and well-appointed. it was awesome to be so close to golden gate park and to many food options within a 5-8 block walk. awesome to have the parking space as well. rocky was friendly and accommodating. thank you!!this location is prefect if you are visiting someone in the sunset of sf. there is plenty of space with a great kitchen. great for larger groups of people. my mother and 3 aunts stayed here comfortably. the n is a block away and you can easily get around sf during the day. then come home to a nice relaxing area. the place is clean and has everything you need.this was our first try with airbnb, and it exceeded our expectations. the apartment had every modern amenity needed, was nice and clean, good parking facilities and is very well located in sf. the host rocky was helpful and services minded. we loved our stay! \\r\\nmy wife and kids (3 girls - 15, 13, 9) stayed at rocky\\'s apartment for three nights in early august 2015.  this was a first foray into renting a private apartment from airbnb and we couldn\\'t be happier with the experience.  from the moment i made the reservation, rocky was very responsive to my questions and we found everything as it is described in the airbnb advertisement.  the apartment was very comfortable for the five of us, the rooms were large, beds were comfortable and the apartment was very clean.  rocky\\'s mom lives in the upstairs apartment and she welcomed us when we arrived to ring us into the building and hand off the keys to the apartment.  the apartment is in a great location in san francisco\\'s sunset neighborhood.  just one block (1 minute) walk to golden gate park and 15-20 minute drive to anywhere you want to be in san francisco.  since this was our first trip to sf, we hit all the major tourist spots with the convenience of a great home base.  parking is a premium in the area so it was very nice to have our own spot in the driveway.  with the windows opened in the living room a fabulous breeze came in from the ocean just a few miles away.  we slept with the windows open and besides some light \"city\" noise, it was quiet each night.  the kitchen was fully stocked to cook anything you need and the fridge and pantry had some sundries to get you started to cook any meal.  rocky checked in, via email, with me during our stay to make sure everything was ok.  we even had the chance to run into him and say \"hi\" as he was visiting his mom upstairs. the only thing i would recommend would be a dvd player for the television in the family room and maybe a smaller television in one or two of the back bedrooms.  no big deal, but worth mentioning for those who want to rent a redbox movie or relax in bed with some late night tv.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend rocky\\'s place to any group needing a quiet, comfortable and clean apartment in a phenomenal location. our family really enjoyed our stay. the apartment was spacious, comfortable and near lots of restaurants. i highly recommend it! rocky and his mom were friendly and helpful!!!\\nwe were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived, to several times during our week stay, through rocky\\'s non-intrusive checking in, whether casually in the hallway or driveway, or through the occasional text. although our host could not meet us on arrival, he did make the effort to check that we were settled in the next day. the apartment was as described, open plan kitchen and lounge area was ideal. fair size bedrooms. possibly benefit from some modernisation of the bathrooms, but overall functional.rocky was a wonderful host. although the listing said i would meet his mom, rocky welcomed us into the rental and walked us through the entire apt to show us where everything was. he even had coffee from starbuck\\'s for us but we didnt have the chance to brew a cup since we were out and about most of the time :)...\\r\\nthe apt. was nice and clean and he provided towels for us to use.  the fact that it came with a parking spot was definately a bonus! the apt is very centrally located as well so we didnt have to drive far which was a main reason we chose rocky\\'s place. i would definately stay here again and recommend to other family and friends! \\r\\nfirst time with airbnbn. excellent choice. excellent apartment. everything you need. easy transportation do sfo downtown. i strongly recommend. rocky is an excellent host.great experience.  some really nice touches (coffee, etc..) very professional transaction.  much appreciated!very nice experience!i will recommend my friends to rent rocky\\' house if they come to san francisco~great experience, great location, parking spot is huge bonus.\\r\\ngreat location. perfectly equipped home. responsive and cordial service.our team came to san francisco for a work trip - this place was perfect! it was very clean and spacious and in a very central location. the towels, dishes and such were all meant for rentals and in good condition.  well stocked with all the staples. rocky and his mother were very welcoming and accommodating.  the listing is a fair representation - it was very comfortable.  rocky\\'s place was perfect for my brothers and brother-in-law to surprise our dad for his 70th birthday.  its location near the 1 while only a short drive to the wharf was great.  having a parking spot, particularly with a mini van was very handy.  there are a lot of shops and food within walking distance.  thank you for helping make our weekend memorable!   very comfortable apartment and have all the needed amenities. rocky is very responsive and accommodative to our late checkout request. checked in smoothly and rocky is very nice to show us the apartment and ensure we are properly settled in. great location, with many good food choices nearby. family and kids love the place, and will definitely consider this place again for sf. rocky (and his mom) were most helpful when our flight was delayed and let other members of our party who had already arrived check in. the apartment is delightful - perfect for our needs and the location can\\'t be beat. we could walk all over - in the park, to ocean beach, to the haight, to my daughter\\'s house - it was great. all directions were posted and easy to understand and logical. it was a perfect experience.complies with photos & description. good location, a little far from town center.excellent location.  listing was completely accurate, owner was there to welcome us and show us around as well as help us with any issues we had.i would highly recommend staying here when visiting sf.  it was perfect for my husband and i and our 2 adult daughters.  rocky and his mother were very gracious hosts.  his mother greeted us upon our late evening arrival and made us feel much at home. the surrounding neighborhood provided all that we needed within walking distance -  grocery store, coffee shop, drug store, train a block away, golden gate park a block away.  we would love to stay here again on our next visit to sf.  thanks rocky!the house was in an ideal location, clean and home-y with a great amount of space for our group of 6. rocky was extremely responsive and great to communicate with, went out of his way to help us out during the stay. we go back to sf at least once a year and will look to stay here in the future!he was eating for us and explained us every detail. whenever we had questions he was immediately available and always real very friendly.rocky was a great host. very friendly and welcoming and in touch regularly to make sure everything going well. the apartment is great. large, clean and bright and everything you could need inside. very conveniently located for local shops and the tram for easy access to city centre. parking space great too. it\\'s only half a block from golden gate park where we ran every morning.... gorgeous viewsrocky was very welcoming and the house was very home-y. great location and 1parking spot was provide. it was a group of 6 so we had 2 cars and street parking was a breeze. definitely plan to come back if i\\'m ever in sf. we didn\\'t get the chance to meet rocky but his mom was very welcoming. she and rocky responded in no time to our messages. she was there when we arrived and helped us settle in. the neighborhood is a nice quiet neighborhood with a walk distance from the golden gate park. the apartment was more than we asked for. nice, comfortable and included the basics like shampoo, body wash etc. the kitchen was also equipped with anything that we needed. we will definitely return to this place in the future. great location and accommodations!  convenient to transportation and very spacious!the apartment has everything we wanted and looked exactly as described.  rocky was a nice host and his mother was very helpful.  would stay there again.i just got back from a wonderful trip to san francisco and could not have been happier with rocky\\'s place.  my brother and sister-in-law were visiting from england and all together there were five of us.  this was the perfect place for us all, spacious, clean, great location and public transportation.  my car stayed parked in the driveway for all three days!!  the apartment was supplied with everything you could need - hairdryer, iron, fully equipped kitchen, shampoo, etc. in the bathrooms.   rocky checked in with us several times to see if there was anything we needed.  he and his mother were great.  i would definitely recommend this place and stay there again.this place and these people are amazing! my wife and i had used air bnb before, but have never had an experience quite like this. the apartment feels brand new and very comfortable at the same time. the browns were incredible people, quick to offer suggestions or lend us a hand whenever we asked. the checked in on us to make sure that we had everything we needed and were warm and inviting the whole week we stayed with them. great appliances, comfy bed, lots of space and stocked like most high-end hotels. stay here. stay here. stay here.absolutely loved it! i stayed in many airbnb places, and this was probably the best one. i could imagine moving in there for a longer timeframe without hesitation. :)\\r\\nextremely clean and stylish, very well prepared. has everything you might need. very private. located in a beautiful, calm neighborhood (it\\'s ingleside terraces, do not confuse with ingleside) that\\'s still well connected by multiple tram/bus lines. i met the host and her brother and both were incredibly nice.we loved staying here. the accommodations are lovely - very calming and restorative - plus there are no unmet needs...the browns have thought of everything! the bed is super comfortable and the kitchen is great. although we didn\\'t prepare any meals, there were plenty of dishes and equipment to do (url hidden) evening we just stayed in and watched a classic movie on the dish-tv, which was really relaxing. the location is terrific, too - very near to all sorts of mass transportation, the airport and even a shopping mall - you are also a nice run or walk from lake merced and the beach. we will definitely will return to this perfect oasis in the city by the bay!i live in san francisco, but my home is not large enough to accommodate house guests, so i\\'m often on the hunt for nice places for my parents, siblings, and friends to stay when they come into town. this apartment is an amazing find! the place is completely separate from the main house, with its own private entry. the layout is ideal--like a studio apartment, with small kitchen, dining area, couch, bedroom, and bathroom. the bedroom and bath have radiant heat on the floors, which my parents were particularly grateful for since it was cold and rainy during much of their stay (it was december, over the holidays). the browns were incredibly hospitable--always reachable if needed, but gave my parents plenty of privacy and space, too. this unit is very well appointed--nice linens, plenty of space in the full size refrigerator, kitchen gear to prep your own meals if you don\\'t want to eat out. i definitely plan to rent this unit again the next time i have out-of-towners come to visit, and i highly recommend it to other travelers looking for a safe, comfortable home base in san francisco.the browns offer a comfortable, lovely 1 bedroom apartment with lots of nice touches - french press and ground coffee for it, for example.  it is a warm and inviting place.  we enjoyed staying there very much and would definitely consider a return visit.staying at 101 sf apt was an absolute pleasure and a better experience than we imagined.  after a grueling evening flight from the east coast we were amazed by the amenities our host had ready for us.   if you like a loft-like feel with modern and traditional touches this is your place.  the subway tiles in the bathroom and the paint colors throughout were relaxing and reminded us of home.  a clean, fully stocked, kitchen with quality pots and pans made our stay very enjoyable.  the radiant floor heating was super comfy, as well as the outstanding location - a quiet and beautiful neighborhood, with ample parking on the street and in the driveway and close to everywhere we wanted to go in sf.  we plan to come back on our next visit and will recommend to our family and friends.  pictures do not do it justice, a fantastic apartment space. melissa gave us a lovely warm welcome on a cold san francisco evening. the apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay and the underfloor heating was a really benefit. the bottle of wine and fresh coffee was an unexpected bonus! looking forward to visiting again on the future.we so enjoyed our stay at the brown\\'s apartment.  it was clean, well appointed, comfortable and safe...all we could ask for and more.  for our needs, it was conveniently located and is a place to which we would definitely choose to return.  the brown\\'s are excellent hosts, so willing to go above and beyond what is expected.  thank you. this was my first time using airbnb and have to admit that the browns set the bar high.  the apartment was perfect, great amenities - we also appreciated the extra touches (french press coffee).  very pleased with our stay.  everything from the beginning of the stay until the end was great. location was easy for getting on the interstate and it\\'s close to many shops and easy access to the muni. the small touches are great, such as clementines and coffee they provide for you and the heated cement flooring. it\\'s a perfect space for two people to relax and enjoy the city. i would recommend to anyone!the browns definitely set the bar high! this little piece of san francisco heaven was just perfect for our quick weekend stay. great, quiet location, close to shopping and restaurants. was nice to be able to come back to a place that feels like home after a busy day in the city, cook up a light meal in the well stocked kitchen and sip on a glass of wine from the complimentary bottle they left for us.  bed and linens were super comfy, the heated flooring was so nice for those chilly evenings and early mornings, and off street parking was nice to be able to pack up the car and go ! we truly couldn\\'t have asked for anything more, and will return in the future. thank you so much for helping make our first trip to san fran a wonderful one! i very much enjoyed staying at the browns.  the apartment was in a very good condition and the hosts were always very nice and helpful!the browns apartment was above and beyond our expectations. it was stylish, comfortable, beautifully furnished and everything you could need was there. as hosts the family are attentive, helpful and kind. we couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay. it\\'s only 15 mins on the train into the heart of san fran and a upmarket quiet neighborhood. we loved it! what a great place to stay! the apt. is even better than the pictures and in a great quiet neighborhood with convenient parking. it is two minutes to the mall for shopping and very close to the park. barry was so helpful and welcoming. he even recommeded good places to eat close by. we would definitely stay there again and tell all our friends! enjoyed our stay with the browns! liked it that the apartment was well-equipped, beautifully furnished and in a nice, quiet neighborhood. comfortable walk to the metro station and transport links. would recommend it!we loved staying at the brown\\'s!! their little apartment type rental is perfect for those travelers that need all the amenities!! we had a t.v., a bed, bathroom, and pretty much a full kitchen (they have all the dishes you would need too)!! it was great for those of us that spend some time in our rooms relaxing on vacation. daly city is basically a small part of san francisco, don\\'t be scared that it has a different city name. we were a quick bart, bus or car ride from the city at a moments notice. we loved it!! close to the big city with the small town comforts of home!! looking forward to staying here again when we travel to sf!! this was our first airbnb experience and it exceeded our expectations.  the unit was 5star - clean, well funished, comfortable, well located and private, melissa brown was hospitable and helpful. we would not hesitate staying there again.  i highly recommend these accomodations.we had a fantastic time at the brown\\'s place! it was an awesome space designed and decorated in such a way that made you feel right at home. little touches such as driveway access, cephalon pots and pans and new furnishings gave this apartment a luxurious feel. the hosts were very accommodating, pleasant and made our stay extremely welcoming and comfortable. don\\'t miss this place!this was our best airbnb experience so far! spacious and very nicely designed apartments in a wonderful neighborhood. hosts are great and the locations is perfect to explore the sf area. the reviews were great, but our expectations were still exceeded. highly recommend to all travellers to the sf area.this was one of the best airbnb experiences we\\'ve had! the house was located in a very nice neighborhood with a beautiful view of san francisco\\'s hilly terrain. the apartment itself exceeded our expectations. it was large and cozy, furnished with good taste! we were happy to have the parking spot right in front of the apartment, right next to our own entrance. browns were very helpful, offering good tips about san francisco attractions. we were able to do laundry at their house, which ment a lot for us as we were on the road for a long time.1. location is great as we wanted to see another side of sf, away from the bustle of san francisco. make no mistake, public transport to downtown sf remains very convenient and accessible (the kt light rail stop is less than 5-min walk away).  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. we had easy access to food (plenty of restaurants along ocean avenue) which is great because we are food lovers from singapore! the vietnamese restaurant pho ha tien is a must-try! \\r\\n\\r\\n3. situated in an affluent residential area, the place is very quiet and tranquil. no traffic din, no rowdy neighbours. it was very conducive for a restful vacation. slept like babies the whole time we were staying. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall: five star comfort and luxury. truly home away from home. i had a wonderful stay at the brown\\'s apartment. all my needs were met, and the apartment was very clean and well taken care of. it was in a perfect location for me, and access to the rest of the city was excellent. would highly recommend to anyone visiting san francisco!wonder little gem of a place just far enough outside of the city for a little r&r. but close enough to the train, busses, trader joe\\'s and whole foods. very friendly owners! comfortable bed and plenty of closet space if you travel heavy. highly recommend. but if you want to travel by taxi to central city, note it will cost $30 one way. we really enjoyed our stay in the browns\\' appartment. it is spacious, comfortable, beautifully decorated, well located and parking was easy since we were able to park in the driveway. the fridge/kitchen could have been slightly cleaner and the bed was a little too soft for our liking but overall our stay was perfect. the browns were very welcoming and very helpful in giving us advice and tips about the area and we really enjoyed meeting them. beautiful place!!! it is as immaculate as the listing pictures. the unit is equipped with everything you will find in a luxury hotel room (such as powerful hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/lotion - some of spa brands, lots of towels, lots of hangers, extra blankets, cooking utensils, condiments, travel guides and tour information) and much more e.g. a private driveway, access to washer and dryer.\\r\\n\\r\\n i had to visit friends and relatives in the east bay, san francisco city and the peninsula during my trip and the location is just perfect. all destinations are within 20-30 minutes away. the area is a quiet, safe and surrounded by beautiful hoyses like the browns. it\\'s proximity to the stonestone shopping mall is a bonus!! i got flowers and fresh fruits there before i visit people. we also did some very last minute shopping at footlocker, j crew, trader\\'s joe and victoria secrets before i head back to hobg kong! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe browns are accommodating, helpful and gives you your privacy at the same time. strongly recommended for anyone traveling to the bay area and renting a car!wonderful place in a super safe area. i would recommend to anyone looking to visit the area. the owners were quick to attend to any needs we had. we had a lovely stay at the browns. the apartment was in great condition and seemed brand new! we stayed as part of our honeymoon, using the apartment\\'s close proximity to public transport to get around sf. the area was very safe with beautiful streets. highly recommend!this was the perfect stay to end our trip to america. the apartment was really beautiful and comfortable after long days exploring an amazing city! it had everything we needed and was exceptionally clean and close to public transport which took us straight into the city. it was home from home and would definitely recommend it!this apartment was perfect for us. clean, cozy and full equipped. the neighbourhood is very save and the subway and supermarkets are in short walking distance. the browns were very helpful and not angry about our little smoke detector story :).\\r\\ni would highly recommend the browns as hosts and the apartment. thank you!the browns were great hosts. checking in was a breeze and they even had strawberries and a glass of wine waiting for us. we were thrilled with our accomodations as the house is in a very safe area and the apartment is 5 star!! we would absolutely recommend staying here.the place was great! clean and just like the pics!excellent, wonderful, fantastic!\\r\\nwe stayed in the apartment managed by the brown\\'s in san francisco and had a wonderful time. it is a beautiful, clean, tastefully decorated apartment with one bedroom. perfect for my husband and i. it was very easy to catch the train into the centre of the city. the brown\\'s took great care of us and offered any support we may have required. they were also very conscious of giving us our privacy.\\r\\nwe would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting san francisco.  we enjoyed our week in a well appointed and comfortable apartment in an established and safe suburb.  it was close to good reliable public transport and within easy walking distance from restaurants and shops.  we were made to feel very welcome by our hosts who went out of their way to accommodate our travel plans.  we would thoroughly recommend this apartment to any visitor to san francisco.we\\'ve just come back from a fantastic 4-nights-stay in the browns\\' wonderful apartment. the house is so beautiful and the apartment is even nicer in real life than in the pictures. it is all furnished to the highest standards and very tastefully decorated. the browns have thought of everything you might need and were always available for any questions or tips. the neighbourhood is also very nice (and safe). \\r\\nthe muni stop (ocean & westgate (be careful, needs to be called as the muni doesn\\'t stop there automatically!)) is just around the corner (3 min. walk) and will take you downtown in only 20 min or to sfo in 40 min (via bart/balboa park). \\r\\nthank you for the great last stop on our trip!the browns\\' place is a lovely self-contained apartment on the lower floor of a family home and it is a delight to stay in. it is in a safe, suburban location away from downtown san francisco and public transport will get you to downtown or fisherman\\'s wharf in about 30 mins. (i caught the muni tram or walked to bart subway system at balboa park station.) the decor of apartment is beautiful and all amenities are well thought of and very high quality. if you are cooking, i recommend the wholefoods market on ocean ave shopping strip for a great selection of organic fare (located halfway along the muni route to balboa park station). the location is very quiet (away from traffic, no rowdy pubs or night clubs). rarely you will be aware of a little bit of noise from movement in the other parts of the house (in keeping with sharing a normal family home space) but everything was super quiet at night. i slept like a baby in the soft comfortable bed. lastly, communication with all owners was great. overall a great place to stay and i would definitely return. we were recently in san francisco and had the opportunity to be guests at the browns’ house , 101 cerritos ave. we feel that these accommodations should be highly recommended. our hosts were very welcoming, gracious and very accommodating. the apartment was very comfortable, decorated very nicely, clean, and very well appointed. situated in a terrific neighborhood, this location has easy access proximity to all amenities, shopping , public transport etc… we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would glad stay here again should we get the opportunity , and would recommend highly these accommodations. thank you browns !my girlfriend and i stayed at the brown\\'s apartment for one week and let\\'s just say the place was spectacular. the apartment was very neat and comfortable, which was very good for us since we were coming from japan. the browns were very nice and were willing to help us out even at a moment\\'s notice. the location was also great. we had the mall, trader joe\\'s, and whole foods all within a few minutes walk. plus, the muni stops were really close and went directly into the city. we greatly enjoyed our stay and we look forward to going again there soon.  joaquin\\r\\nwe had a great stay at 101 sf apt. the apt is clean, well kept, and comfortable. picture are accurate. great apartment and easy access to transit. good neighborhood. the browns are

michigan.exactly as listed. the area itself is the west side of san francisco, and you are close to public transportation that will take you where you need to go. it felt much more serene and restful than staying downtown.  the place is very nice, and it was much nicer than staying at any chain hotel. the hosts were very warm and receptive. the place has everything you\\'d need for a nice stay.

this home!my husband and i stayed in the brown\\'s 101 san francisco apartment. it was our first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. we were in san francisco visiting family-and it was perfect for us and so close to the relatives! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is delightful-gorgeous homes, wonderful yards & flowers, great location for us, very safe and quiet. there is a mall and shops within a 10-15 minute walk. the apartment itself was very clean, comfortable and had everything you would need. we mainly had coffee and simple breakfast in the apartment, but you could easily cook meals there. \\r\\nthe shower was nice and there were plenty of towels. the queen bed was very comfortable and the sheets were soft and good quality. normally we sleep in a king bed so sleeping in a queen is not great for us, but given all the other positives-i would definitely stay here again in the future. the pictures on the site are a true representation.\\r\\nthe owners of the home were accommodating, professional, and kind. we arrived at 11pm-no problems at all with check in. the unit is at the back of the house and looks out onto the backyard-which the family is finishing off with a stucco fire place. barry\\'s son was working on the project and he was concerned about waking us up too early in the morning-but we had no problems at all with that.  \\r\\nthe price was great and a good value for us. we would definitely stay there again if it is available. thanks!!!!\\r\\nholly & johnwe had a wonderful 5 night stay at the brown\\'s apartment. it is really well located, has

though we had a middle of the night arrival due to flight delays. we had a wonderful experience staying with them, and would certainly stay there again!our stay was magnificent!  melissa was so incredibly lovely as she welcomed us warmly upon our arrival.  what i loved most about our hosts were the proper balance they showed between being available as a support but leaving us to enjoy the beautiful garden apartment without being intrusive. the apartment itself was impeccably clean, newly renovated, and of course in san francisco, it\\'s always a perk when parking is included.  in the living room were lots of up-to-date brochures and booklets to provide us with tourism guidance. fresh fruit and a bottle of wine also awaited us. we couldn\\'t have been more pleased with our accommodations and will be returning!101 san francisco apartment is a well-appointed private apartment in a quiet environment. it is comfortable had everything we needed to make your stay enjoyable.

breeze, we were able to park right in the driveway upon agreement. we used this as our home base to explore the bay area and were so happy to arrive back in this welcoming space every night after long days of sightseeing outside the city. the bed was super comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. we would love to stay here again on our next visit to san francisco and will be recommending this gem to friends or family who may travel to the bay area. 5 of 5 stars! fantastic stay at this lovely apartment.\\npro\\'s:\\n- very well connected yet peaceful. a block away from

definitely recommend!the browns were so nice and warm-hearted. we arrived very late at night and were ready to follow the instruction to get the key. barry heard us and came down to give us a very warm welcome while showing us around the apartment. the house was better than expected. easy access to the town, great neighborhood. we enjoyed our stay very much. strongly recommend!this is the best accommodation i have come across in my last 5 years of staying in various airbnb places around the world. very thoughtfully furnished, everything a traveller may need is provided. very aesthetically furnished, convenient parking, very close to public transport to downtown. it is very quite, peaceful locality. i would recommend anyone who wants to be in central san francisco to choose this place.the browns were great to communicate with and made us feel really welcomed as soon as we arrived.  my wife and i really enjoyed the apartment as the decor and warm atmosphere immediately made us feel at home.  the location is very close to a lot of san francisco\\'s hot spots and we would not hesitate to stay here again.  you\\'re going to love it here!the browns apartment is a wonderfully cozy designer retreat from the hubbub of sf.  nestled in a classy area adjacent to st. francis wood and the fantastic west portal shopping street, as well as the stonestown mall (all in walking distance).  beautiful residential neighborhood, very quiet and private space underneath and behind their beautiful home.  they are wonderful and friendly hosts.  you couldn\\'t ask for anything better. we had stayed at the browns apt before and as before their apt served as a wonderful cozy haven for my wife and i as we were in a tough process of a family member dying.  they were as gracious and flexible as could be...anything we needed with a topsy turvy uncertain schedule.  they are great and kind people.  you won\\'t find a better setup whatever your needs.  by the way my wife and i are in our sixties and we r tough to please!  the browns have succeeded in all ways in creating a home away from home experience.  we will never stay anywhere else when returning to sf.we really enjoyed our stay at the brown\\'s residence. my wife and i felt very welcome. the apartment was fully equipped and very spacious, and the neighbourhood was ideally located for us to discover san francisco.  and with a private entrance and parking, we felt right at home. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this modern apartment and would recommend it to anybody visiting san francisco.the browns\\' apartment was the perfect place for our stay in san francisco. conveniently located and they were extremely helpful whenever we needed them. will definitely stay here for our next visit!we really enjoyed our stay here. clean, had everything we needed, and a great location. having access to parking was great and convenient. would definitely recommend!my parents stayed here when they came to visit me and my family in san francisco, and they loved it.  beautiful neighborhood with easy access to the freeway, public transit, grocery store, coffee shops, restaurants, etc.  the apartment itself is very tastefully decorated, and my parents said the bed was very comfortable.  checking in was a breeze with a key box.  they are looking forward to staying here again when they return next year!the apartment is wonderful! well stocked kitchen, tasteful furnishing and super comfortable bed. a nice little outside area to utilize as well. we will be back!i love this place! it\\'s so pretty, perfect space for 2 people. nice & cozy. the neighborhood is gorgeous! super quiet & safe. the parking space was an added bonus. melissa greeted us & was super cool! they really did a great job with the space. close to public transportation & whole foods! i would stay here again in a heartbeat checking in was super easy. my first night i was a bit later than i thought i would be and melissa waited up for me my first night to show me around.  the apartment was immaculate. it had everything i needed and more! a wonderful kitchen, really nice shower and a bed that i could have slept in for days.  the neighborhood is quiet and really pretty. nearby mall, whole foods and more in a cute lil neighborhood.  all in all, it was a great introduction to sf.  i only wish i found it earlier and could have booked it for my entire stay.  this apartment was perfect in every way!  it is centrally located in a lovely neighborhood, with parking for our rental car and within easy walking distance of public transportation, stores, and restaurants.  with limited parking in the city of san francisco, we used the public transportation (muni) when going downtown, and our car when we ventured to outlying areas. the beautifully decorated apartment was spacious and clean, with everything we needed and more. check in/check out was a breeze with melissa greeting us at the door with our keys making sure we knew we could contact her if we needed anything (which we didn\\'t)!  i highly recommend the apartment (i already have) and would love to stay again if we visit san francisco.  this was our first experience with airbnb and it was awesome.  i cannot say enough great things about it.  we definitely will use the service again!host was very welcoming.  apartment was beautiful and tastefully decorated.  lovely little outside space with a fireplace and garden.  the browns\\' apartment is all that you could ask for in a home away from home that will suit the needs of just about any airbnb traveller. have a car? - off street parking is available. no car? - the k light rail is a 5 minute walk away and takes you downtown. the kitchen has everything you need to prepare meals (there\\'s a trader joes & wholefoods nearby). the apartment is very comfortable, clean and well appointed. spacious bathroom, under floor heating, dish tv, comfortable bed. the browns are great hosts - friendly and responsive to queries/requests. we had an amazing stay.tere and barry have a lovely apartment, in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood incredibly close to the muni and bart making geting around simple and easy. the fresh flowers from their garden, basket of maps/current information and scads of closet space made our stay especially enjoyable!the browns were so nice! the apartment was great, perfect for 2 people. residential neighborhood, so if you\\'re looking to stay in \"downtown\" san francisco this isn\\'t for you. but the metro station was only a 4-5 minute walk from the apartment, and takes you right into the heart of the city. we loved our time there!the browns warmly welcomed us, showed us the apartment, explained how things worked, and were available if needed.  the apartment was perfect for my husband and i, and the parking space for our rent car was so convenient.  we loved being close to public transportation, as well as within walking distance of family there.  we would stay there again in a heartbeat!overall, the place was nice and actually looked better in person than in the photos.  the browns are nice people, and i thought barry was especially cool.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni think the browns need to be more flexible with their check-in policy.   they insisted that i meet them in person so they could \"check me out\" before giving me the key.  they wanted to \"check me out\" even though i had already submitted to them my life story, online profile, and website.  the window of time was 5-10pm, which was highly inconvenient for me, and just not feasible.  they wouldn\\'t leave a key for me, and after a 20 minute phone call with melissa, we were at a stalemate.  i was out with friends in the city and she wanted me to leave the restaurant i was at and come get the key in person.  i tried to reason with her to leave the key for me and she wouldn\\'t do it.  this conversation was a feedback loop of insanity.  finally, after she hung up on me, she called back and my girlfriend spoke to her for 15 more minutes, and melissa finally relented and said she would leave the key for us under the doormat.  those phone calls were completely ridiculous.\\r\\nthe listing was completely accurate. the apartment is very comfortable, spacious, clean and quiet. it was also a good location for us; pretty close to golden gate park and a relatively easy drive to other sights. barry was friendly, but didn\\'t intrude on us at all during our visit. sorry that we left the windows open that one afternoon!how best to describe our time at the browns, utterly fantastic.\\r\\nthe apartment was amazing and very comfortable, ample space with just the right amount of homely feel.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would be happy to stay again, close to public transport straight into market st, space to park our hire car and the browns were friendly and welcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks for an amazing place to stay.we spent five nights at the apartment and loved it.  we traveled all day from the east coast and were not able to check in until almost 11 pm., but melissa, our host, was very gracious and welcoming. because it was so late, she generously gave us some cream from her refrigerator so my husband could have coffee in the morning.  she was readily available when we had questions, but gave us full privacy.  we used the off-street parking in the driveway which is just a few steps from the apartment\\'s private entrance.  the apartment was quiet, comfortable and beautifully furnished. it is in a great location and provided us with convient accesss to downtown san francisco either by car or by the muni.  we would highly recommend this airbnb. my first airbnb experience and it was a homerun.  great place to stay if you are in san francisco.  the apartment was very comfortable, clean and well appointed.  the hosts were very friendly and welcoming.   a nice quiet retreat from downtown.  just a block of the muni so it was easy to get into the city.  i would definitely stay there again.melissa and barry were great hosts and very helpful. the apartment was very clean and the neighbourhood was perfect. our host made us feel incredibly welcome.  the neighborhood was great and the description of the apartment was spot on.  parking was easy and accessible.  i would stay here again in a heartbeat.the apartment was very nice and clean. the location was very convenient to public transportation as well as some stores. we really enjoyed our stay wonderful stay with the browns! san francisco is one of our favorite cities to visit and now we have a favorite place to stay during future visits. from booking to checking out, everything went extremely smoothly. the unit was absolutely perfect (cozy, clean and comfortable) and included all the amenities we needed - kitchen, access to laundry and in driveway parking for our rental car. the perfect retreat after long days hiking around san francisco. our hosts couldn\\'t have been friendlier or anymore accessible, but left the amount of interaction during our stay up to us. as this was one of many trips to the city we felt pretty comfortable with the area but they gave us a good run down of the close by necessities (grocery, etc.) and provided a great sushi restaurant recommendation, their fav, one evening at our request that was a hit! even hunted down an insulated bag on short notice so we could pack a picnic lunch one day. very helpful and accommodating hosts! thank you to the barry and tere for making our stay so wonderful!this is our 3rd time with the browns and we simply love it. the unit is cozy and comfortable and the neighborhood is lovely with very easy access to pub trans. tere and melissa are wonderful hosts and it is always a pleasure to see them again. this is a true home away from home. my wife and i stayed with the browns for about a week. we arrived quite late on our first day since we had to drive up from la (11 pm), but the brown was kind enough to wait for us. they use traditional key instead of the electronic code key. so they had to give us the key personally. they even showed us around the unit and offered to help us with the our luggage. the space is nice with private parking space. it was spacious with everything we need. clean and neat too. the bedroom however has no door. so it\\'s kind of like a studio where it is connected to the living room, pantry and everything else. since we have the space for ourselves it wasn\\'t an issue for us. and it is a quiet neighborhood too. so no need to worry about noisy street or public sound. if you are a light sleeper or more sensitive to light, it is wiser to bring your eye mask. since the blind on the bedroom is not enough to block the sunlight. it\\'ll get quite bright in the morning depending on the season and weather of course. the heating and cooling system uses a timer. if you ever need to use them, you need to set the time when you wake up, leave the place, come back and sleep for every day. tv is a bit small. but we spent most of our time outside so it wasn\\'t an issue too. washer and dryer are available conveniently located through a connecting door. it is better if you have your own car with you since the house is not located next to a main street. you could walk to the nearest main street and catch a bus (10 min walk). or you can always call an uber. you can find everything you need nearby (target, malls, restaurants, whole foods, 24 drive through etc). so no need to worry that you stay in the middle of nowhere. it is 20-30 min drives to the city of san francisco itself. overall it was a great experience staying at the brown. they were very accommodating to our requests and the location is perfect, it is close enough to san francisco downtown but quiet and safe enough to live and enjoy your private time. we would love to stay there again should we visit san francisco again.my stay at the brown\\'s was wonderful. the place is nicer than the pictures and description reveal. it is peaceful, quiet and has everything you need. the location is great, near west portal for good food and scene and for me since i needed to get to the peninsula every day, very conveniently located near the 280 freeway. the browns were wonderful hosts, attentive when needed but otherwise basically invisible to me.\\r\\n\\r\\ni wish i could have stayed longer! highly recommend this spot.this apartment was everything i needed for my recent business trip to san francisco - it was clean, beautifully presented and just the right size. it was great that it was connected to the house but a separate self-contained flat. the area was beautiful and quiet so perfect if you want some peace!we had a great stay at melissa\\'s place!\\r\\nmelissa was also very friendly and helpful.\\r\\nthe location is perfect to travel fast within the city.\\r\\ni felt like home, hosts have decorated the place in such a way that there is no other possible way to feel. very conveniently located for either business or vacation. will definitely be back!it was very nice for the two of us to stay at the brown\\'s for 4 nights. everything was neat as a pin when we arrived. the kitchen was nice, and nice to have for making breakfast. the bed/sheets/comforter were extremely comfortable for us too. there were lots of towels and they were very high quality. the heat is radiant floor heating, which took some time to warm up, but it was very toasty and completely silent for the duration of our stay. the neighborhood is super-nice and totally safe. there is a whole foods about a mile away. we loved having the off-street parking spot for the car (in the driveway), which was directly outside the entrance to the apartment. thanks! this was our second stay at 101 cerritos, and everything was perfect like the first time.  we were visiting our son and his family who live nearby, and this was such a better experience for us than staying in a hotel.  everything you could ever need is within walking distance, although you wouldn\\'t know it, because the beautiful house is situated in a lovely residential area with great character.  thank you to the browns for being such gracious hosts.very welcoming, beautiful neighborhood and accurate description!great location, nice apartment close to good restaurants and shops this clean comfortable two bedroom condo was perfect for my two couple traveling group for the following reasons:\\r\\n1. there was plenty of room for four people.  one bedroom had a full size bed and the other bedroom had a queen size bed.  the living room gave us a place to unwind together.  \\r\\n2.  the north beach location is excellent for walking to the pier area, getting on cable cars/buses, walking to restaurants.\\r\\n3.  communication with charles was great.  even though i never met charles, he supplied me with all the information i needed to have a wonderful time in his condo.  also, he was flexible enough to allow me to add a day to my visit.guang was a wonderful host! nice cozy place and felt very private. the sofa bed was surprisingly very comfortable. would definitely return again if looking for a place nearby!guang was a gracious and helpful host, he made out stay in san fransico very comfortable. all though the couch was not the most comfortable thing to sleep on i would definitely stay here again. cute apartment in a great location. host was very welcoming and considerate.guang was a very helpful host,  and the place was great. i stayed there for 5 nights for a conference in moscone west. the location was awesome. additionally, the sofa bed was very comfortable. if i have a conference in moscone next time, i would definitely stay there again.neat and tidy place with host very helpful if you need orientating in sf or the immediate area. the host was absolutely wonderful and a delight! the listing was even better than described. having a bathroom to myself was a super plus. the neighborhood is great because there is a wholefoods and safeway within walking distance. raemee, our host, was very welcoming & gracious. the home is newly remodeled & comfortable. the neighborhood is safe, lively & was fun to explore; great restaurants, (esp. plin) shops, bars & coffee shops mixed throughout what looks like was once a depressed part of town.not only was jonathan was an amazing host who was helpful, accommodating and welcoming, his home in lower pacific heights was beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home, located in perfect walking distance to everything (literally, everything) was large, clean and incredibly comfortable. the house was perfect for our group of six with plenty of space and lovely layout.\\r\\n\\r\\ndid i mention the location? we walked to parks, shops, restaurants, cafes, tourist attractions, without needing to use our car once.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you to jonathan and his family for such a wonderful stay. my family enjoyed spending a long weekend in this beautiful home.  it was very tastefully decorated with lots of room for adults and great spots for kids to play in.  the host was great to work with, got back with me always within minutes and was very welcoming.  we had a wonderful time here and it felt like home.  i would highly recommend renting this house.   my family of four had a wonderful experience staying at jonathan\\'s home in the lower pacific heights neighborhood of san francisco.  his home was wonderfully decorated, very clean, and had a tremendous amount of space for all of us.  this was our first airbnb experience and we were very impressed with the quality, location and reasonable pricing of jonathan\\'s home, where we stayed for nine nights.  it was a great \"base camp\" for exploring the san francisco bay area - from napa, to santa cruz (pacific coast highway!), to palo alto (stanford!), as well as throughout the various sights to see in san francisco.  the house is in a lovely neighborhood, centrally located, and walkable to everything - including a wonderful grocery store (mollie stones!), as well as a corner dry cleaner and convenience store for picking up a bottle of wine to go with our take-out pizza (delfina\\'s!). because we did so much traveling around the bay area with our rental car, the garage and automatic garage door opener was a tremendous benefit for us. we will be back next year!the location is excellent. this was our first experience with airbnb and when we travel in the future i can\\'t imagine staying at a hotel. the house was as good or better than described. we felt like we were home. i would recommend anyone traveling to sanfrancisco to stay here. there are great restraurants within walking distance and if you drive you can be anywhere in the city in 10 to 15 minutes. i couldn\\'t have asked for a better airbnb experience. not only was the house wonderful but jonathan was extremely welcoming and helpful from start to finish.\\r\\nthe house is gorgeous and was perfect for our family visiting from australia.\\r\\ni would highly recommend this property to anyone traveling to san francisco and looking to stay in a great home and in a very safe and local neighborhood.\\r\\nthank you jonathan, my family adored their time in san francisco.the host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this is a shared room. only 5 minutes walk to union square. audrey is very nice, and let me lend her key. thanks a lot.we did reservation just few hours before our arrival and david was responding fast. he have met in the late evening, otherwise we would not have such a place to stay :)\\r\\n\\r\\ngarage is very usefull, grocery close and pretty much anything is within few minutes driving, muni also close.\\r\\n\\r\\nplace was clean and cozy with great design stuff. great value/price if your budget is not too big and you want to be close to the city.absolut perfect place for relaxed days in sf: very nice furnished house, quiet bedrooms, sunny terrasse, nearby supermarket, a very good connection to downtown by public transport and a private parking place...thank you very much david!david is great and so is his house!\\r\\n\\r\\nhe met me at his wonderful place to give me the keys. made sure to show me all the features of the house. and was very quick to respond to any questions that i had during my stay. i would certainly stay here again if/when i return to san franciscoif you haven\\'t figured it out by now, david\\'s home, in mid century modern design with contemporary surf and street art dotted around, makes this property a gem find. this is for the tasteful and design oriented community looking for space and function. david has everything to offer including my preference for a stocked fridge of nice ales. even my cousin who lived a few blocks north in noe valley decided to leave her car parked in the garage out of convenience. while the house is a perfect hideaway to host friends and family including the lovely yard, the streets outside may not offer much in visual aesthetics -- a neighborhood going through major development, with amazing latin coffee joints or the sodapop fizzery make it all worth it.david was the best host! his place is immaculate and very centrally located to all the good spots in san francisco. he was very clear about the amenities offered and went out of his way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. i could not say enough about how hospitable he was! my friends and i had the best time. if you are ever in san francisco, do yourself a favor and book david\\'s place. you will not be disappointed!david\\'s home was exactly as described, very clean, and easy walking distance to lots of great stuff.  david was incredibly fast and helpful with any questions we had throughout the visit.the owner, david, was very nice and helpful. the house is very convienient for up to 4 people, great having a garage.\\r\\nare there any negatives worth mentioning ? in all honesty no.we had a great stay at david\\'s house.  transportation was very easy with muni train and bus stops right out the front door.  safeway grocery store about three blocks away.  another smaller food market even closer.  great cambodian restaurant two blocks away.  bernal park was several blocks away and uphill, but well worth the walk for the spectacular views!     \\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat place to stay in san francisco at an incredible price. \\r\\ndavid was very responsive from our initial inquiry through the end of our stay. the house is very clean, and you can tell that david has put a lot of thought into aesthetics and interior design. there\\'s also some fantastic restaurants located nearby. david\\'s place was ideal for our vacation to san francisco.  having family living in the city , it was convenient to bernyl heights and and glen park.  walking distance to lots of restaurants, etc. it was also very stylish yet comfortable.  the additional amenities of a garage and washer and dryer also made our weeklong stay much easier.  i would definitely return to david\\'s place and hope to next year if it still available! \\r\\n\\r\\ngreat place to stay!!! very comfortable, clean, and extremely close to public transportation. i highly recommend david\\'s home!great stay, nice clean apartment. even though it\\'s on mission st the street noise couldn\\'t be heard in the bedrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n david was a gracious host. he went the extra mile for us on more than one occasion.  a great communicator and always informed us prior to stopping by. \\r\\nthe apartment is clean, functional and comfortable with wonderful design features.  it offers lots of space to sprawl out, both inside and outside.  \\r\\ni would honestly move in if i lived locally.   david was really easy to work with and his home was beautiful and clean. \\r\\ni was arranging accommodations for out of town colleagues and with david\\'s open communication style it was a breeze.  \\r\\ni have more people from my company scheduled to stay at his home in the up coming months! \\r\\nwhat do you say about the home you don\\'t want to leave? i\\'m sitting here about to take off and all i can think is, i hope i get to come back. the space is pretty open with lots of natural light. the most beautiful furniture you can hope for, a kitchen equipped with everything you\\'ll need, a bed so comfortable you\\'ll work out of it as long as physically possible and a garden that is an oasis. bonus, the garage fit an explorer xlt without a problem. on a personal note david is awesome. we had a small issue and he took care of it while we were out. you really can\\'t beat thiswhat

linens and all essentials in the kitchen for cooking.  the garage was a welcome bonus for our rental car in the city.  the home is located on a fairly busy street, but we couldnʻt hear the street traffic from the rear facing bedrooms.  overall, a perfect spot for our family to meet up and spend a few days in the city.  i would absolutely stay here again!  had an amazing stay at david\\'s! the

had a great time at this sweet place. david is a great host; met us at 10 pm when we arrived and gave us a thoughtful, thorough tour and orientation to the house. convenient location and use of the garage much appreciated in sf. thanks, david. we would rent your well equipped home again in a minute!\\nmichael and georgiagreat apartment. well equipped and spacious. very helpful owner. good vibes.

timely manner. his apartment is very neat and has everything you would need to make it your home during your stay. our entire group is in love with the apartment and it\\'s decor. simple and yet really well done. the location isn\\'t in best neighborhood. however, it is bear a bart and there\\'s a garage parking so we didn\\'t have any difficulties getting around. \\n\\noverall, i would recommend this apartment. fantastic place.  david is a great host!the place is wonderful! it is a lot bigger than it looks in the pictures. david was very accommodating and he showed us all we needed to know. also, it is perfectly located (right across the street from a muni sation) in a very cool neighborhood. we\\'d all stay there again! :)thank you david for being such an amazing host.  myself, my husband, my brother in law and my husband\\'s cousin stayed here while visiting san francisco. david met us at the house when we arrived and showed us around the house and reviewed popular sites to see in the area.  this was much appreciated.  the place looked exactly like what it does in the pictures - neat, clean and very comfortable... having such an incredible spacious backyard was a bonus. of all the places we stayed in california, david\\'s place was the best.  \\r\\n\\r\\nwe highly recommend david\\'s place and would definitely stay there again on our next visit!we had a great stay at

denmarkdavid\\'s mid-century modern apartment is the perfect place for our family.  it is chic, comfortable and clean! this is the second year we have stayed in the apartment and both times david was extremely accomodating. the apartment is very close to public transportation but conveniently has a garage as well.  since we like to cook in once in a while on our visits, david\\'s apartment is also very well stocked with gourmet kitchen equipment and cookbooks!\\r\\ni would definitely stay here again on visits to san francisco!great stay at david\\'s apartment.  david is an excellent and considerate host. the apartment was clean, well furnished and spacious.  and the garage parking is very convenient if you have a car.\\r\\n\\r\\nwalking distance to some really good restaurants (especially tataki south -- if you like sushi).great comfortable apartment full of designer furniture in a lovely neighborhood. david is a very considerate host and his collection of architecture and design books is reason enough to stay here. everything was as pictured and david was a great host. lots to do in the area and it was great to have a garage. very stylishly decorated. one of our best airbnb experiences ever. very comfortable apartment, beautifully decorated, with every accessory one might want. also very conveniently located, and the garage is priceless. our host david could not have been friendlier and kinder. immensely recommended.david and micah were great hosts always at hand and ready to answer our questions and concerns. the apartment is very spacious and fully equipped with a great back yard. the decor in the house is nice though perhaps a bit below the quality one would wish for with a somewhat small-ish bathroom. the house can be a little bit noisy. however the location is great and bernal heights has lots to offer ! lovely clean house with more than enough amenities. great central and convenient location. david is a very kind and helpful host as he sometimes went out of his way to help us find what we needed. david\\'s apartment was the perfect setting for our wedding weekend. my now husband and i had an intimate modern wedding at city hall and this apartment was the perfect place for getting ready and taking photos. the garage access was incredibly convenient since we drove up from los angeles and we were near anything we could have needed.david was very welcoming and walked us through the apartment and amenities upon arrival. he also made himself available for any questions we had during out stay!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was also extremely cozy and well decorated. it was close enough to the city, so we were under a $10 uber ride away from mostly everything we wanted to do. we absolutely loved staying here and would recommend to anyone!amazing apartment, super clean and convenient - david was very helpful and friendly!  we enjoyed very much staying at david\\'s house. it is exactly as in the photos. very clean and neat and had everything we could need. david made us feel welcomed and cared for. the garage was very convenient - we entered through the garage and then went up. the area is nice. it is an up and coming area near mission with some really nice residential streets with small stores.david was extremely accommodating and friendly. his home is spacious and in such an amazing neighborhood. i would most definitely stay again. i never got a chance to meet david personally but he was a good host checking in every couple of days making sure things were good.  the space is great as it is quite large with a lot of inside and outside living space.  the muni is conveniently out in front though i didn\\'t get a chance to take it.  the only thing to know is that the street is a bit busy so if you have trouble with noise you may want to bring ear plugs (an issue throughout most big cities naturally) but that aside i would definitely rent from him again.david\\'s place is amazing! he\\'s also super accommodating and very friendly,  we loved our stay there (we were there for both work and pleasure.)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space is even brighter and more comfortable in person, with a perfect location that is just south of all the crazy mission action, but close enough to walk there and not have to search for parking if you want to go out. it is also super close to grocery and coffee shops. there is an amazing back deck/hidden garden that we ate supper in and drank morning coffee in. tasteful art, nice linens, comfy beds, a fully stocked cook\\'s kitchen, and a garage! \\r\\n\\r\\nwe had the best time, and like i said, david is just the nicest host, available by text, and not at all hovering or pushy. will definitely stay here again on our next trip to sf if it is available.\\r\\n\\r\\nxo levandoski\\'s\\r\\nfran is such a hostess of the utmostess shall i say. the offering is as advertised, great views, amenities and a whole foods down the hill...coming back up that hill you\\'re on your own. after a day of exploring this great city, the hot tub was a welcomed pleasure that you\\'re not likely to enjoy at a motel, hotel or inn. in a city notorious for parking issues, i found it not a problem in her neighborhood, plus there is a bus just a couple blocks from her door. should i be returning to the city soon, i hope this hidden gem may still be available as the sailing world cup and conventions keep this city by the bay jumping.we had a fantastic stay at frances\\' house. we took two rooms that were great, with a small deck with a gorgeous view over downtown san francisco. it was convenient to be able to use the kitchen at times to have breakfast before going exploring the city. conveniently located near caltrain and bus lines. definitely a good choice when staying in san francisco. i had a wonderful stay at frances\\' place. the room was exactly as described, spacious, with a lot of natural light and quiet (you\\'ll not hear any noise from the freeway). the views from the balcony are indeed stunning (the place is on a hill, so you need to be prepared to climb it if you don\\'t have a car).\\r\\n\\r\\nguests can use the kitchen, which is equipped with everything you could need, and help themselves with fruit, croissants, coffee, etc. on the last day of my stay i needed to print my boarding pass and frances saved me by letting me use the printer.\\r\\n\\r\\ni definitely recommend the place.the room was great! very conveniently located, comfortable, and with amazing views. the desk was really helpful for getting work done. the host (fran) was very friendly and helpful. she is very familiar with the area and she can provide with valuable guidance on a broad range of topics.fran was a great host.  she had the place ready in great condition and the room was as advertised.  the neighborhood is great and the view from the balcony is amazing!  she even picked me up on my first day from the caltrain station and we had great conversations throughout the stay.  i\\'d love to come back and stay with her again!perfect!  we will never stay anywhere else in sf.  fran is an excellent host; she is hospitable, gracious and not intrusive.   the room has great views of the city, is very clean and well appointed and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  the wi-fi is flaming fast and complimentary and parking is ample and free.  the next street over is a busline so public transportation is very convenient.  we parked our car on the street for the weekend and got a muni pass which worked out great.\\r\\n\\r\\nstay here!perfect stay.  fran was gracious, welcoming, but she didn\\'t mind that i was tired and antisocial on my first night.  the space was warm, comfortable, well equipped, luxurious.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ll definitely try to come back.this is one of my most favourite places to stay in san francisco. the view is stunning and i really enjoyed standing on the balcony and looking at the nightly skyline. \\r\\n\\r\\nfran\\'s house is modern, new, clean, tasteful and was great to come home to. i enjoyed this quiet getaway from the stress in the city and the walk up the hill which is rewarded with this spectacular view. \\r\\n\\r\\nrestaurants can be found in the neighbourhood in quantity and quality and fran has great recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\ni recommend staying here.just had my second stay at this beautiful home.  it is exceptionally comfortable and peaceful.  fran is quiet and non intrusive yet helpful and flexible should you need anything while here.  i slept very well in the comfortable bed and was able to make tea in the mornings and some simple meals.  the back yard hot tub is totally luxurious.  have stayed now in both bedrooms - both are clean and comfy.  both have porches and views!  it\\'s a great place in a safe part of town, easy to walk to buses,  restaurants, whole foods, wine, and coffee shops.  i plan to return. santa fe charm and style echoes from the tasteful furnishings right through to the hostesses warm welcome.  i stayed at fran’s unique and comfortable home for 17 nights whilst on business. having previously stayed in hotels whilst in san francisco the luxury and space offered at fran’s retreat were first class but with all the convenience of being in a fully equipped home.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe panoramic views of san francisco from potrero hill are breath taking, only amplified further from the hot tub. on a clear day you can see the top of golden gate bridge. the balcony adjoining the guest room affords sweeping vistas of the city skyline, providing a beautiful backdrop to a g&t.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe rooftop terrace, complete with webber bbq and bay bridge aspect is a great escape on a balmy californian evening.      \\r\\n\\r\\nfran was flexible and accommodating, proving to be an invaluable source of local knowledge and even allowed me to borrow her bike to explore the city.\\r\\n\\r\\ni’d happily recommend fran’s wonderful home. \\r\\nstaying with fran is always great. she was not at home and trusted me with her master bedroom, which is just wonderful and very comfortable. fran has a great interior decoration style, was very responsive when i had questions and although being remote was always approachable.\\r\\ni stayed at her place while other guests were at her property and really enjoyed the interactions with them.\\r\\noverall i can very much recommend staying at fran\\'s place.fran\\'s place is amazing - views of the entire city;  sit in the hottub and see the city skyline;  and she\\'s a fabulous host.  highly recommended.our room was phenomenal — tremendous panoramic views of the city —\\xa0and the house was great. convenient location. easy walk to amazing food in the mission. and fran is a friendly

returning...fran\\'s place is truly lovely, spotlessly clean, and had everything i wanted. the room is beautiful with a great view, and had a desk for me to work while i was there. the tea and coffee machine was great, i\\'ve never used a keurig before but it was effortless. i shared a bathroom with another guest, who was my work colleague. we had the entire top floor to ourselves. my room had a fantastic layout, a great view, and a large closet with plenty of room to place my things. fran was around just enough to be helpful, but certainly not underfoot - she has a busy life of her own and seems to just do airbnb for fun! next time i\\'m in san francisco, i would have no qualms about staying with fran again!! staying at fran\\'s place was my first airbnb experience and it was wonderful. i stayed there for four nights and there was nothing i was not happy about. everything looked as wonderful as shown in the photos, or even better. the house is cozy and tastefully decorated. the view from my desk was the best view i could imagine, not to mention the view from our little private balcony. and the hot tub with the view was the highlight! i used it everyday and always felt i was such a lucky person to be here. \\r\\n\\r\\nfran was quick to respond to all of my messages. her instruction to check in was very clear. she is very nice and generous. she prepared everything a traveller would need in your bathroom. staying with her is like staying in a five star hotel where the highlight of the trip is the place you stay.  i highly recommend fran\\'s place and will definitely come back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nfran, thank you so much for this wonderful experience and for offering me the blueberry pie. you already set my airbnb standard very high. fran\\'s place indeed had amazing panoramic views. it was such a joy to watch the skyline from the hot tub, the living room, or the bedroom and the  wake up to light coming in from the corner windows.a beautiful large bedroom with an incredible view of san francisco from both windows plus a balcony in a very upscale home which was quiet and very comfortable.excellent room; great views; beautiful home; easily found parking across the street. fran is friendly, helpful and accommodating. highly recommend.my boyfriend and i stayed at fran\\'s house and had a really wonderful time.  fran was very kind to us and gave us great

stay at fran\\'s house. it was very useful to be able to park on the street. \\nfran was very helpful in providing local information and i would definitely stay there again in the future. fran\\'s place has a great view, is nicely located atop a hill in a sunny part of town and has some good restaurants nearby.  it\\'s an easy commute if you\\'re working in soma too. we loved fran\\'s beautiful home, her art collections, potrero hill, the local restaurants and we found fran to be a casual, comfortable and interesting hostess.\\r\\nfran is very friendly and her home is absolutely beautiful! due to host availability, we were only able to stay one night. we would have loved to stay longer. fran was friendly and very accommodating, assisting us with a slightly earlier check in (due to flight schedule) and allowing us to leave our luggage late the next day. we were unable to spend much time getting to know her, as we wasted a good portion of our day napping and recovering from jet lag. however, she made herself available via phone and text and was quick to answer any questions we had. it is obvious she has taken the time to think about her guests and the practical things they may need, as she provided a laminated walking map for us to use while exploring. i would not hesitate to stay there again!fran was a good host, it was easy to get in contact with her throughout and she even organised baseball tickets for us in the run up to our stay and drove us to the grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is lovely, up on a steep hill with great views of the city. the room was very comfortable and other highlights included the fabulous hot tub and washer and dryer, which were greatly needed as we were a couple of weeks into our trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe were travelling without a car and you cannot walk downtown, but there are nearby transport links and fran informed us of cheap taxi options too. it is also a nice area to explore with some interesting restaurants and a wholefoods just a few blocks away. all in all, i would highly recommend staying here.we had a great 2 night stay at fran\\'s beautiful home in potrero hill. the home is on a classic steep san fransisco street and had wonderful views of downtown. the home itself is amazing with a great kitchen and living room set up. our bedroom and upstairs bathroom were perfect and we really enjoyed the views from our balcony as well as use of the hottub in the backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house isn\\'t that close to downtown but there are plenty of transit options very close by, as well as being close to a number of interesting neighbourhoods. parkign is also free and very easy on her street if you have a car.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend staying with fran to experience living in a classic san francisco neighbourhood in one of the nicest and coolest houses you will ever visit. fran was a great host, sending us infos and tips about sf in advance and welcoming us warmly into her amazing home. the house is beautiful and has a wonderful view! we can only recommend fran as a host and her house for a stay in sf!fran made us feel at ease from the start. her home was beautiful and extremely comfortable. a

car. i recommend this place to anyone going in sf, you won\\'t regret it.had a great time in fran\\'s appartment in san francisco. the room was cozy and had an open feel to it. we shared the upper level with another guest but did not feel uncomfortable. everything was clean and up to date. hottub was a big plus after walking around san fran all day. all and all it was a great stay. it\\'s not really close to all the sightseeings, but that\\'s our own fault because we spend most of our time downtown. if you\\'re interested in the mission area this is a great place to stay!\\n\\ntip: turn your steeringwheel of your car towards the street when you park in front of fran\\'s house, it will save you a 80 dollar ticket :) (fran also wrote it in her manual, but hey what can you say haha)  fran thanks for the hospitality!absolutely fantastic.  this room was exactly what was expected.  great views, clean and tidy and ms. maier was so very nice to my girls.  we will definitely be stopping by again!the room was wonderful and very well situated for exploring the city. the home was clean, the bed very comfortable, the views from the hot tub unparalleled, and the host very accommodating. paradise with views and hot tub is correct! fran was a lovely host, very well organized, beautiful home and friendly atmosphere. the house is a 6 minute cab ride from the hustle and bustle of downtown and sits up on a hill with the most amazing views. the bed is comfortable, shower is sublime and fran is very welcoming and accommodating. i would definitely stay here again!this home is very beautiful.  it\\'s everything as described, and fran was a gracious host.  i would definitely look to stay here again.we´ve stayed to san francisco for three nights at frans home. the house is

home.fran has a great home. the room i stayed in is comfortable with a great view of the city. it has a desk which is important for me. the bathroom has a tiled shower with two shower heads. there is coffee in the morning. it is on a steep hill, which i like. whole foods, restaurants like chez papa, are within walking distance. great spot.this place was great and the room we rented had amazing views of san francisco and the bay bridge. it was within walking distance of several coffee shops and grocery stores/markets. street parking was also easy and plentiful. unfortunately, we did not take public transportation into the city from fran\\'s place, but i am sure it was easily accessible. \\r\\n\\r\\nfran was detailed and provided us with a ton of information and tips on visiting san francisco (thanks fran!). she also gave us a recommendation for a breakfast spot nearby. \\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, a great place that is well situated in the city. enjoyed our time in fran\\'s nice home.the view is marvellous and the hot tub very relaxing.fran made me feel incredibly welcome. her house and my room was beyond comfortable - the pictures didn\\'t do it justice. this was my first experience with airbnb and i am now an advocate! beautiful house, great view of the city from our bedroom.  the location close to the mission area was very convenient, and having the hot tub to soak in was great.  fran was helpful suggesting things to do in san francisco.  we would recommend people to stay here.  great location and beautiful home.  we would certainly go back and stay there again.  beautiful and very comfortable home.  fun to actually stay inside one of those san francisco houses that we always walk by and wonder what they look like inside.  our room was very comfortable with all the amenities we needed- wireless, tv, nice bathroom, great city view.  the kitchen was available for our use and fran made us feel welcome and at ease.  if it is available the next time we are in the area, we will stay again!it was a treat to stay in fran\\'s gorgeous and comfortable home.  our room had great windows with a panoramic view of san francisco.  the kitchen was well laid out and always available for the basics, and i was able to use the refrigerator to store a small amount of food that i picked up at the whole foods market near her home (it is within walking distance).  our room was comfortable, and although we had to share the upstairs space with another couple for two of our three nights- we did feel we had enough privacy.  tv and wireless were both provided.  parking on the street was always available.  if available, we will stay again when we are in the area.we had a great time with fran. her house is situated in a lovely neighbourhood with the best views on the san francisco skyline. in her neighbourhood you will find a great place for breakfast, coffeebar with real espresso (not the american one), a nice winebar and some good restaurants! we had a good size room with a little balcony and a great view. the only thing we didn\\'t like was sharing the bathroom although it was clean. i extended my stay with fran because she had an opening and it\\'s the best place i\\'ve visited in the city thus far.  it was lovely!  thank you fran!fran made my husband and i feel welcome by opening up not only the room we stayed in, but her  home and beautiful outdoor garden.  the pictures on airbnb really do not do this lovely place justice.  it was beautifully decorated and the views were fantastic.  be prepared to walk some steep hills if you are going to do anything on foot from fran\\'s place!  but, that is also how you get the great views of the city by the bay.  she has a wealth of knowledge about the city and was available during our stay to help.  my husband has a thing about sharing a bathroom (would prefer not!) but it was not a problem at all.  great bed, clean room and bathroom.  we had a super time and would definitely return.fran was a wonderful host!  the home was absolutely beautiful, and the room had a fantastic view of downtown, even a great view from the hot tub!  very quiet neighborhood with no problem parking (parking can be a huge issue in other parts of the city).fran was sick! she was really accommodating with all of the amenities the house had to offer. our balcony had an amazing view and the bed was super comfortable. the whole foods was a huge plus and the hills made us feel less guilty about the food we ate. the shower was unbelievable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis was our first time using airbnb and it completely sold us on the service. fran was an excellent host and we will for sure visit again when we return to the city.we had a very nice skyline of the city, especially in the dark it is amazing. having a relaxing bath in the hot tub in the garden after a long day was supreme. the description of the neighborhood and how we get into the city was very helpful. \\r\\nthank you so much for a wonderful time at your place.this was my husband and mine first experience with airbnb.  fran was absolutely wonderful.  she was quick to respond and extremely helpful from answering multiple emails with extra questions to sending her gogobot with information of things to do while visiting san fran. her instructions for checking in/out were well described.    \\r\\nthe house and views were incredible!  the room was a great size and comfortable - we had a great night sleep.  there was amble parking in front for our rental car.  this was such a positive experience that we would not hesistate to stay here again!fran\\'s house is beautiful! and she was perfect host, even inviting us to join her and her friends at their world series watching party. her friends were delightful. i wish we could have stayed much longer, as she has a wonderful book and art collection. i would highly recommend staying at fran\\'s.as you can probably already tell from the photos, this is a beautiful home in a beautiful neighbourhood. the view from the hot tub is particularly great.\\r\\n\\r\\ni also loved being able to walk to the mission district for its food, bars and nightspots.\\r\\n\\r\\nfran made us feel welcome, and has lots of advice for getting the most out of san francisco.amazing home & exactly as pictured & more!! very clean with coffee and tea available each morning.  i stayed here for a class i took at creative live during the week.  perfect location five minutes walk to studio!! thank you for making me feel right at home!!fran house is absolutely amazing, we think the pictures do not show how nice this place is!!! she gives you clearly instructions on what to do and also offered to drive us the last day. but upon this she went above and beyond when two days after our stay she met us at the car rental office where we having problems and manage to have them giving us the car. without that help our trip was totally ruined, so we can\\'t be more grateful to her.lovely top floor bedroom with views of city and lights at night.  stayed here over the new year holiday - saw the new year\\'s eve fireworks from top of potrero hill.   fran was very friendly and helpful with neighbourhood tips.  easy street parking.  included wifi, laundry, coffee/tea in morning.   would stay here again, definitely recommend.   we had a fantastic time in san francisco. fran was extremely gracious and hospitable, not to mention her home is absolutely spectacular. the location is great, lots of restaurants and bars, close to the bart and cal train, and only a few dollar uber ride alway from the rest of the city. i really wish we had a few more time to spend. thanks fran! fran left a welcome note for us when we got to her place and had e-mailed us prior to our arrival. the room was made up, with fresh sheets on the bed and towels in the closet. fran\\'s home is in a great area and it is a short uber ride to just about anywhere, and within walking distance to a lot of amazing places too. the highlight was coming back after a long day of sightseeing and getting to sit back and relax in the hot tub with an amazing view of the city!i had a fantastic stay at fran\\'s home. the location was only a 15-20 minute commute to the heart of the city via taxi or 30-45 minutes via public transport. the hot tub was a lovely treat after long days exploring the city, and the views of the city from her house are amazing. this room is great value for what it offers and we would definitely recommend it!fran has a great space in a beautiful, walkable neighborhood. fran\\'s communications are clear and concise, and the room i stayed in was clean and comfortable.\\r\\nthe next time i\\'m in san francisco i hope i can stay at fran\\'s place again.amazing place with very high standard facilities.\\ni didn\\'t use the hot tub at all, but the coffee machine, the electric locks, the beautiful bathroom with hotel soaps and lotions, the good bed, the balcony in the room with the amazing view... everything clean and working perfectly.my daughter and i had a great first experience using airbnb.  we stayed at fran\\'s house for two nights february 11-13 in the potrearo hill section of san francisco.  it was a perfect location in san francisco, in a nice neighborhood and so convenient to everything we wanted to see.  the views from the house were spectacular from the street and upstairs bedroom.  it was very clean and the accommodations were very comfortable.  the ability to park right outside the house was really great.  fran couldn\\'t have been a nicer host so friendly and hospitable.  she recommended a few good places to go and she especially wanted to make sure we were safe when we went out at night.  we loved the plow breakfast café which was so close to her house.  the breakfast was the best i ever had especially the ricotta pancakes.  we were able to see alcatraz, chinatown, pacific heights, lombard street and union square, all within close proximity.  thank you fran for sharing your lovely home with us.  \\r\\n\\r\\ndonna and lindsay  my first experience using airbnb could not have been any better, thanks to fran\\'s accommodations. the room was as pictured, spacious and functional with a beautiful view.\\n\\nall aspects from the bathroom to the balcony were pleasant, well-kept and clean. fran offered recommendations that were helpful at just about every part of our trip (restaurants, transportation, etc.)\\n\\nwe appreciated our 3 night stay in potrero hill, being close to an inviting and friendly neighborhood as well as being a  15 minute lyft ride to union square, pier 39, mission district and more. highly recommended.this was our first airbnb experience and it was simply wonderful! the description was absolutely accurate and i loved the quaint neighborhood. fran was so helpful from booking on...she was quick to help and ask how our day/travels had been. she was such a wonderful host and so welcoming. the room was wonderful, the bed comfy and the view outside our balcony was amazing! loved every moment!  loved getting to stay in a neighborhood rather than a hotel!absolutely fabulous host, great place, great location, great access to everything, super friendly, clean, quite. if 100 is the best score, this place deserves a 110!!!loved the room ... comfy bed, nice linens, lovely bathroom and an amazing view of the city. fran was a warm and friendly host and the neighborhood was quiet and lovely. hope to return.this place is too good to be true, like an hg tv house. the views are beyond compare, and the pictures do not do it justice. so much to do within walking distance, and surprisingly, parking was more than ample. would love to come backfran\\'s place was absolutely lovely. i was visiting for work, so i only wish i had a chance to relax and enjoy it more. the bed was ridiculously comfortable, the room was sunny and lovely, the shower was deluxe. the neighbourhood is perfect if you\\'re planning on doing a lot of driving into silicon valley as i was -- it\\'s right near the major highways. very convenient. i\\'d be back in a heartbeat!fran was very welcoming and accommodating to me. not to mention that i had a friend over and fran was welcoming to my friend as well! the house was super clean and well kept. the interior was totally my style of the house so i enjoyed everything that the house had to offer. the location of the house was extremely convenient to major places like the mission district, castro, and other parts of sf. you also get a great view of the city from your own room and when you\\'re walking around the neighborhood.  fran was a great host. welcomed me upon my arrival and showed me around. comfy bed and tv in the room. great views and temps are great with the windows open!i feel great when staying at fran\\'s house. i highly recommended it! fran is very welcoming and willing to provide help and advice all the time. i feel like to stay at your own home. the room i lived has one of the best sf view i\\'ve ever had. also the neighborhood is very safe and quiet. i am also surprised how convenient it is to go to downtown sf. i suggest future guest without a car to walk to mission to have food, it is much easier to walk downhill to get there. we had a great time in s.f. & while staying at fran\\'s. her home is in a nice quiet neighborhood with a great view of the city. fran was helpful with recommendations and tips for our stay and was very attentive to our needs. would definitely recommend her home if your in the area.i felt very welcome at fran\\'s home and it was exactly how it was describe at the website. it felt like to be at my own home.  i was very happy and satisfy to be there, i wish i could of find her place two years ago!fran was great and has a wonderful house in a great neighborhood.  the views were great, parking very easy and the room comfortable.  would recommend to anyone.  lovely place - the views from the bedroom and the hot tub are amazing. fran was very accommodating and we felt at home. lots of good eating in potrero and the mission which are very close. you can\\'t go wrong booking this place for a base in sf. enjoy :)it was very first time to visit to sf and use airbnb. the house had clean room, beautiful view and super greatful hot tub!!! we really recomended hot tub and view at night!! thanks to fran and her house, the trip became a handred times better!!!fran was a great host. she was down to earth and very helpful. i had such a wonderful visit with fran!  great host, beautiful room, and lovely neighborhood.  i would highly recommend it. you\\'re on the top of a steep hill, so make sure you have walking shoes.   :)fran was a great host! it rained on friday when we flew into sfo so our flight was incredibly late getting in - fran was easy to access and really accommodating when it came to our late arrival. she was also great about our departure. our check-out time was technically 10:00am, but our flight back to lax didn\\'t leave until 9:00pm. again, she was accommodating and let us leave our book bags with her until we needed to leave so we wouldn\\'t have to carry them around the city, which we were super thankful for! her home is lovely and has a fantastic view. we enjoyed our stay even if it was just for the weekend! i would definitely stay again! fran\\'s place is amazing! super well organized, extremely clean, and the bed was super soft. thanks fran!this bnb location is wonderful for visiting san francisco.  we were able to park our car and either walk or use public transit very easily for three days.  fran has a beautiful house in a lovely quiet neighborhood.  the room we had has tremendous views of the city to the nw. we enjoyed access to the kitchen for morning breakfast preparation and fran offered continental cuisine.  during our stay, fran had good tourist suggestions and easy maps to follow.  we would heartily recommend this beautiful property!this was our first time visiting san francisco. fran\\'s place was just what we were looking for. her home is so perfect and lovely and very comfortable. the hot tub of course is a great treat as well.  fran does a very good job at describing the place in detail. as she says, it is in a quiet neighborhood, and it\\'s a small distance from the main attractions visitors are looking for. being new yorkers we were a bit disappointed with the public transportation san fran offers. it\\'s a small hassle to trying to get around cheaply. most everyone, we learned, uses uber to get around if they don\\'t have transportation of there own. there are great places close that are good for eats and drinks, however be prepared for the steep up hill walk to or from anywhere.\\nthe views from the garden are amazing, especially at night. fran really knows what she\\'s doing when it comes to hosting. beds are comfortable, house is clean and organized. we had such a lovely stay. staying at fran\\'s house was an absolute pleasure. the room itself was perfectly clean and ready upon arrival, offering a stunning view over san francisco. \\r\\nfran was available for tips and a chat here and there, making for a great airbnb host. i\\'d book fran\\'s place again any time and can absolutely recommend it. potrero hill is a great area to stay, especially if you\\'re looking to explore the nearby mission district.i had stayed at fran\\'s house before, so i think returning speaks for itself! i was very busy with work this week, so i basically only came home to sleep and shower. the neighborhood is quiet and full of beautiful houses, and fran\\'s is no exception. house was beautiful and clean, bed is extremely comfortable. i didn\\'t get a chance to use the hot tub, but i have previously, and it is great. fran was out of town while i was there, so i didn\\'t actually see her, but she was very communicative via email.fran welcomed heartfully welcomed us in her house. the room where we stayed was nicely decorated and comfortable with a nice view to the san francisco city. the room was well equiped and clean as it was the shared bathroom. the neighborhood was quiet and safe with relatively good access to the public transportation. still, i would recommend to use uber/taxi on the way back, since the house is situated on the top of a hill.\\r\\nthanks for the great tips fran!!fran was a delightful host, very welcoming and gracious to my boyfriend and i.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfran’s home is gorgeous,  very clean and offers great views of sf. upon arrival, fran  gave us a brief run down of where we can store food and where she has yummy muffins for her guests in the morning. she also had a plate of brownies for us to enjoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nour room was very clean with lots of natural light and sweeping views of the city.  \\r\\n\\r\\nwould highly recommend staying at fran’s if you are respectful and want to stay in a clean and beautiful home with great restaurants nearby.fran\\'s place is top notch.  beautiful view, great bed, clean bathroom, high end finishes, convenient location, and fran is very friendly and easy to work with in terms of scheduling and logistics. highly recommend!fran\\'s house was lovely and so was she. we especially enjoyed watching the sunset over the city each night from the hot tub. absolutely beautiful! parking was a breeze. nice stay and thanks for frans kindly host. the house located in a very convenience place in mission district with great view. will share this experience with friends.i stayed with fran for 4 nights during a work trip. her house and the west room are luxurious and make you feel pampered. the home gets lots of light through the large windows with great views of twin peaks to the west and downtown to the north. tastefully decorated with a southwestern flare, and clean. showering was so relaxing in the beautiful bathroom with skylight. street parking was readily available in front of the house. public transit was not the most convenient in this neighborhood so i just enjoyed long walks to wherever i wanted to go. there are a good handful of restaurants as well as a couple of grocers and library branch w/in 10 min. walk. check-in was plain and simple. always a pleasure to stay at fran\\'s! place was immaculate, per usual, and i found time to use the hot tub this time. definitely my favorite place to stay in sf!we truly enjoyed our stay. amazing views, a friendly host and a convenient location make this house an excellent base for exploring san francisco. we look forward to returning. fran was a wonderful host. she has a beautiful home with a breathtaking view of san francisco. she was friendly had great suggestions of things to do in san francisco. i would stay again when i visit sf in the future. when we arrived, fran welcomed us and showed us her very beautiful house and our room. the room and bathroom were very clean and the view from the balcony over the san francisco skyline is a real highlight. \\r\\n\\r\\nduring our entire stay, fran was friendly and helpful - be it when we were looking for a place for dinner or when she helped us find good seats for a game of the giants.\\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately, we could only spend two days at her place before we had to fly home, but we can definitely recommend it.fran has a great place with an amazing view of the city. the two rooms up-top are quiet, cozy, and can\\'t be beat. fran herself is wonderfully accommodating and gracious. thank you, fran!great stay at a beautiful home. close to a lot of good restaurants and a great view of the city. would definitely stay here again! great, clean quiet and quaint place with an absolutely amazing view of the city. fran was a pleasure to communicate with and had some great neighborhood suggestions. highly recommended!wonderful host, beautiful location! we booked a last minute honeymoon and stayed here for two days and it could not have been a better experience. clean, quiet and the hot tub and views are amazing!  fran was fast with communication and super nice and professional.  located in a perfect area and it was great to walk to fran\\'s suggested restaurants and coffee shops, all were excellent.  also close by to everything else in the city, a quick uber/lyft ride away or public transportation. thanks again for everything!i enjoyed very much staying with fran. she is a wonderful host. the house is very clean and quiet. i would definitely recommend her to everyone!fran was responsive and provided for a warm, inviting stay in her beautiful home! highly recommended and we will definitely stay again when we return to sf - thanks fran! we had a wonderful time at fran\\'s place in san francisco. the house is truly gorgeous, from the beautiful interior design to the spectacular views of the city from the patio garden outside. being able to see the golden gate bridge as we relaxed in the hot tub was a definite highlight. the room was very spacious and well-designed, with a balcony with impressive views, and the bed was extremely comfortable. the adjacent bathroom was lovely - including a huge shower which was a real treat. the property is located in a homely residential area with some great restaurants nearby as well as the mission district. we had a car which helped with the hills, although these would have been negotiable on foot - and it is san francisco, after all. fran made the whole experience easy for us - from check-in to check-out she was nothing but helpful, despite only being there in person towards the end of our stay. we were in san francisco at the end of a longer trip and it was our anniversary whilst we were there; i couldn\\'t think of a better place to relax and celebrate. by far the favourite airbnb property i have stayed in.fran\\'s home is absolutely beautiful, and pictures really do not do the incredible view justice! the room and bathroom were both very lovely, and the bed was particularly comfortable. fran was a very welcoming and inclusive host - i would definitely recommend!fran was excellent and gave us a great recommendation for vietnamese food just down the block.  the room was clean and comfortable and had the most amazing view of the city at night. we also had the chance to enjoy the hot tub during sunset which was incredible. would certainly stay again.we had a very nice and comfortable stay with fran. everything was clean and we enjoyed great views over sfo from our room.we enjoyed our stay at fran\\'s place. great view over san francisco, nice bedroom and great, big bathroom. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was also great that we had the possibility to use the hot tub with an awesome view over the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe would come back any time and recommend fran\\'s place to our friends. easy access for dropping bags thanks to the electronic locks. just a short walk down to whole foods. lovely home with hot tub overlooking the city is a nice bonus after a long day.the house and surroundings were just great. the house is delightful and very tastefully decorated.  the view of san francisco from the bedroom is absolutely stunning. fran is a great host and we had lots of written information about the area. bathroom is shared but super clean and great appliances.as our first \"shared home\" airbnb experience this was definitely a great start!  fran was very welcoming and made us feel at home.  we were very comfortable and had everything we needed. the views from our room were amazing and the neighborhood was a great home base for exploring the city.  what a lovely place to stay in sf.  fran has really nailed the art of airbnb hosting.  access was easy with the electronic lock.  the hot tub was very relaxing.  nice bed and plenty of clean linens.  the room was fantastic, lots of space, well equipped with a desk to do some last minute sightseeing research, work or whatever you need some space for.  you don\\'t have to worry about wondering where you\\'re at when you can look out the window or off the balcony and see most of san francisco.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood was quiet, and just a short drive to anywhere in town.  you can even walk to some fantastic mission district restaurants\\r\\n\\r\\nfran was welcoming and friendly and seemed very genuine.  i would definitely stay here again and recommend paradise on potrero to anyone fran\\'s house was clean and very well located. we enjoyed the view from our bedroom and sept very well despite the little storm :)!it was great to be at fran\\'s place :) the house is lovely with beautiful views. it is located in potrero hills and i find this area to be one of the best in sf (safe, nice neighbourhood, great views overlooking the city). the bedroom is located upstairs which gives a lot of privacy if you need to. there is a also a very large and modern bathroom. i really enjoyed spending time with fran and i hope to come back to fran\\'s place very soon : )best first night away from home i had, ever. fran was an amazing host! she was available 24/7 to help me with any needs, questions, check-in etc! she even has this pretty awesome motorized bicycle for rent to help you get around, which i highly recommend! thanks for the great stay fran!fran was super nice. her place was cozy and perfect for the weekend. the morning view from her rooms was so worth it! the view plus coffee makes a good start to the day!had a fantastic experience at frans place.  it is a beautiful home and the downtown sf views from my room and patio were absolutely amazing.  staying with fran was great! she is a great host and even better person. would love to stay again when i go back to sf.thank you again for making our stay at your home a warm and welcoming one! the space and décor were perfect and it was a restful, relaxing place to spend some time during a full and fast-paced week.  you made us feel at home and we loved the ease of all of the amenities, including the spa-like bathroom and our own private terrace overlooking the phenomenal view of san francisco.\\r\\n fran was wonderful! her home smelled of warm banana bread upon my late arrival. i was traveling on business so i didnt see her much but she was kind, helpful. her home was perfect. the west bedroom that i stayed in had the most beautiful views of the city. i would highly recommend her place to anyone. fran\\'s place is beautifully decorated and makes you feel like home. she was so considerate and provided me with everything i would need. the morning tea and english muffin were super tasty. and the view from my room was so amazing! i really did enjoy my stay there and would definitely come back again.our 2 nights spent in fran\\'s home were quiet and comfortable. my wife and i slept well and the view from our room was incredible.\\nsharing the modern and spacious bathroom with one other room on the top floor required us to be sensitive re noise and time spent . enjoyed our interaction with fran and would stay there again.fran is an excellent host with great location in san francisco. her house provides great views and i felt really welcome. we met couple of other hosts during our stay, all of them interesting guys from tech industry. fran\\'s place is a sure-shot for my next business trip to sf.another great experience! like a home away from home in san francisco. weather could not have been more perfect. slept like a baby both nights, quiet and comfortable. thank you, again, fran!fran was extremely welcoming. she let us a book her place last minute and stayed up to show us around the house. her home is clean and has everything we needed plus beautiful views of the city on our private deck. highly recommended and i would definitely stay again in my next visit. fran was super cool! we met her the day before leaving and had a nice chat with her, she also had great recommendations about things to see (thank you for recommending zion, we really enjoyed it!). her house is really well kept and clean, coming and leaving is very quick thanks to the keypad, the bed is super comfy, the views are amazing and the hot tub is the cherry on the top! i would definitely recommend anyone who wants to spend a lovely time in san francisco to stay at fran\\'s place.we loved staying at fran\\'s place. she was very accommodating to our needs (especially check in and check out times) and even offered us delicious cupcakes that she had made. it was great to wake up in the morning and use her keurig for coffee (since san fran coffee is expensive!). her home is beautiful, clean, and welcoming. would love to stay with fran again next time we visit san fran!my mother surprised me on mother\\'s day(!!!) but my house already had guests! i found fran on airbnb and she seemed like a wonderful women that my mother would get along well with; this was her first airbnb experience and she loved it. her review is as follows: \"it was a real treat to stay in this lovely home with great views and location in a quiet neighborhood with easy street parking. the friendly accommodating host (fran) provides a high end appointed home with very comfortable amenities.  the atmosphere is welcoming and unassuming.  we are pleased to recommend this host and her home as a great place to stay while in san francisco.  we will stay there again without hesitation.\"fran has a beautiful place and i can see she\\'s thoughtfully done her best to make her guest\\'s stay comfortable and inviting. i work very long hours when i\\'m in sfo so my physical time at the place was limited but i really i appreciated her kindness and flexibility with my schedule. the keypad on the door was perfect for coming and going without needing a key. the view and the balcony were a lovely treat after a long day. i would highly recommend her place.fran was so kind and nice host. the room and bathroom were clean, especially the room that has beautiful view was good. fran\\'s home is very nice place to go to downtown. thank you fran!a beautiful home with great views. i would stay here again.fran has a wonderful and welcoming home and personality. the room was better than expected and the hot tub a welcome retreat after a long day at work! the home is spotless and well prepared for visitors. no disappointments what so ever! this will be my go to first choice when visiting san francisco!fran\\'s place was amazing! her home was beautiful, and the room was even better than the photographs! we enjoyed the view from the room that we stayed in, as well as how close her home was to all of the other neighborhoods that we wanted to visit. fran was friendly and her suggestions were very helpful. would definitely come back again!from the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome, fran showed us where all the things we would need were; dishwasher, fridge, coffee, towels etc. we could come and go as we liked as there was an electric lock on the door (so we didn\\'t need to worry about losing a key). the house is located high on potrero hill with amazing views over downtown san francisco but within a 10/15 minute drive to the piers, where a lot of the action happens in san francisco. there was ample parking on the road and it was free, which was a nice difference from the parking in downtown san fran. would certainly recommend we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in fran\\'s beautiful home. clean, bright and luxurious. felt like a stay in a luxury hotel, but more personal and private. fran made us feel very welcome and the view was superb too. would definitely try to book again if visiting sf. thank you!ben and anna have a lovely house with a really spacious guest room & full private bathroom. the light through the windows is wonderful, but the blinds also work quite well when you\\'re trying to sleep in the morning. the guest room faces away from the street, so i was able to leave the windows open at night for fresh air, without much outside noise. there\\'s a great roof deck, and their place is very close to dolores park. it\\'s pretty much the ideal spot to stay in sf, with all the amenities i hope for when i use airbnb.this home is among the very best secrets in san francisco. it\\'s perfect in every way and even better than what is shown in the pics online. it has everything you could possibly need. even though it was a work trip, having a beautiful home in the middle of the city to come back to made all the difference. we had a blast!! this is an exceptional and well maintained home!a vgreat location , superb property and well furnished home.\\r\\nthree guys normally in a hotel hunkered down here for the dreamforce conference. i used it for meetings and we relaxed outside the normal hubbub of the event.\\r\\ni will use again  - certainly!it sounds too good to be true, but it\\'s true!  this house is amazing, immaculately kept, and provided 3 colleagues and i with a much more relaxing stay in san francisco than the nearby hotels could have provided.  the location is great, near many great restaurants.  we were in town for a conference at the convention center and were able to walk there daily.  the house is equipped with everything you could think of - we literally felt \"at home\"!  taso is a great host - we had left some clothing behind in the closet and he delivered them after we left town to another colleague\\'s hotel to be returned to us.  he was very helpful and accommodating from planning to check out.  a great choice!taso was a great host and this house was the perfect home away from home for a week long stay.  the house was really cozy and nice and we were within walking distance to union square and moscone center which made our stay even more convenient. cabs were easy to catch right outside the door for the days when we were running too late to walk!   i would recommend this house to anyone looking for relaxing accommodations in the middle of downtown sf!the house is perfect, the location is great! my family and me had a lovely stay, it is a typical san francisco house with everything you need, very cozy, tidy, clean and in perfect condition. you can see that it is a house with all the amenities you need: laundry, wifi, near to union square, cool restaurants and bars around, etc. we loved the house and will love to stay again! taso was a great host, he did everything very professionally and according to what we discussed!some work colleagues and i stayed here on a recent business trip rather than getting several hotel rooms. it was perfect! there was enough space for everyone and having the living room and kitchen was nice because it didn\\'t feel like you were stuck in a small room all the time. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe hosted several meetings with customers and they even commented on how nice it was to be in a place that felt more like home.\\r\\n\\r\\nit was a short walk from everything we needed (moscone center, shopping, restaurants, public transportation). we will definitely stay here again!we had an amazing time at this house. everything was perfect. we even got a welcoming treat! the house was spotless and the kitchen was filled with everything you would need (although the restaurants in the area were so good, we didn\\'t cook anything). the showers had shampoo, body wash, hair dryers, and great lighting for getting ready. the living room was stocked with books and a great selection of dvds (we watched zoolander and juno!). located in a convenient area close to some amazing shopping. would definitely stay here again!this is a great place to stay if you want to room with a bunch of people within walking distance of everything. super considerate host had lots of extra bedding, towels, a coffee machine, and even a bottle of wine if we wanted it. comfortable for everyone, even the couch and pullout bed. i would stay here again!great location - easy walk to everything around union square. \\r\\neasy check in and out.  nicely appointed rental condo.taso\\'s house was perfect for our team trip to sf.  very clean, cozy, and conveniently located minutes from union square.  highly recommended!taso\\'s house is in great shape.  it appears to have had a very recent remodel and all the amenities are beautiful.  the location is typical of downtown sf: close to everything with great shopping and restaurants nearby.  we were there for a meeting at the moscone center and it took less than 20 minutes to walk there at a leisurely pace.we had an excellent stay.  the location is great and the house is really very nice.  i highly recommend staying here.the 611 house was perfect.  three of us were attending a conference and the location was easy walking distance to our venue, food, and cocktails.  i would imagine it would be the perfect location for s vacation stay\\r\\n\\r\\nthe rooms and everything are clean and comfy.   the garage is a luxury.  really it was perfect.  no hassles and wine on top of it.  \\r\\n\\r\\ntaso was very helpful and accommodating. i needed a place for my family visiting from germany: three adults and three kids. they said that they loved everything about the place, especially the central location. to the german reviewers: sehr gutes preis-leistungsverhaeltnis! 5/5 stars!\\r\\nlovely and well decorated home in central san fran. everything you need to sleep and care for 8 people. a real home! main room and dining room spacious and comfortable. both have a tv so the boys can watch the sports and the others have their own common space. outdoor table & chairs to get a little sun. i hate to tell others about it (selfish) but i owe it to taso.our group was staying in sf to attend a conference at the moscone center. we prioritized being able to stay together and have a shared meeting space, which we missed in previous years staying in hotel rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nenjoyed having a space of our own after a long conference day. the area is convenient for walking to moscone, as long as you\\'re comfortable with a 15 minute walk. the area borders some sketchier parts of the city, but can be avoided if you choose your route properly.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, the place was an easy place to stay and have a space of our own in the city. the front sitting room gave off a strange musty odor which opening the windows mostly took care of. the rest of the house was odor-free. \\r\\n\\r\\nexcept for the smell, this place is a nice place to stay for groups. they even left us a bottle of wine!great place to stay, fantastic location and taso was very accommodating. would definitely stay here again. loved it!\\r\\nwe had a most enjoyable stay in this wonderful house in an exceptional location. i would recommend this home most highly and look forward to returning at the earliest opportunity.our experience was great; very comfortable environment, roomy, clean, and inviting.  very convenient location, too!  if the need arises in the future, we would happily look to stay here, again.  thank you!i am so thrilled with the house by union square/moscone cente.  a group of 8 women traveling for a conference made the house our home base for the weekend and the house was perfectly located and situated for that many of us.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was comfortable and in perfect order.  \\r\\n\\r\\ngreat and lovely house, all amenities in the house are new, me an my friends had a great time in san francisco.\\nthe house is located in the center of everything and it\\'s very easy to get anywhere.\\nthe house is very comfortable. i definitely recommended.great location since it\\'s just a couple of blocks from union square. house is very spacious and clean. we were 5 adults traveling and the house was never cramped. it\\'s a great place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. this was our first use of airbnb. the house exceeded our expectations. it was all very easy. i can strongly recommend the host and house.this place was outstanding.  the location near union square makes it ideal for visiting the city.  there is a bus stop right outside, and easy access to bart, etc.  the house was immaculate and extremely well stocked (new cookware, plenty of dishes, glassware, nice sheets, etc.).  we had plenty of room, and a very nice touch is the charming little patio out back.  a wonderful place for morning coffee.  our host couldn\\'t have been more helpful, recommending local shopping, and answering all our questions.  thanks, taso!  great location and nice and clean home. we went for a conference in the moscone center which is a 15 min walk from the house. also good shopping in the area. there is nothing better than that... clean and great house to stay.\\r\\nall our members loved that. my experience was great. the booking process was easy. the house itself was everything and more than advertised. we were a party of eight and were able to eat in together most nights. the house is centrally located to downtown. i love san francisco and the house location was perfect for all the activities we wanted to do. keep in mind the garage is for small cars, if you need a car rent on a daily basis.we had a terrific stay in taso\\'s house!  the place itself was roomy, clean and well organized.  the kitchen was well decorated, well stocked and felt brand new with granite countertops and great appliances.  the neighborhood was very city - unlike the more residential feeling neighborhoods closer to the wharf.  you had all the conveniences of city living right outside your door as well as all the interesting characters and foot traffic passing by.we had a lovely time in san francisco. the house was beautiful and in a great location. taso provided everything we could possibly need. we would definitely stay there again. the experience in taso\\'s house was really great\\r\\nwe were 7 of us (4 adults and 3 teenagers, 16 to 21 years) and have appreciated\\r\\nbeautiful, very convenient, confortable and luxurious house\\r\\nvery close to union square\\r\\ntaso is a very nice host\\r\\ni would definitely recommend this locationthe appartment locate in center area of the city, very near union squar, walk distance to fishman peir. it is a comfortble apartment, and taso is very nice too. the house was really everything it was said to be. being in the union square area, we were assuming a small house w small rooms and limited space. we were happily surprised... big bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen and dining area. this house is near everything, we really enjoyed knowing how close we were to the house while we were venturing out around the area. taso did a great job stocking the house w amenities,  even went as far as to give us a bottle of wine for staying there. i heavily recommend this house to everyone that wants some space from the hustle and bustle of san francisco and is tired of the 20 x 20 foot boxes they call hotel rooms.\\r\\nthanks again taso.very pleased with my first airbnb experience.  the flat was very clean and comfortable - great artwork!  taso was very easy to communicate with and was a real pro :)  thank you so much!  would definitely stay here again - jwjust perfectmy six friends and i loved this house.  it provided everything we needed for our holiday and we felt the quality and standard of accommodation was equivalent to a five star hotel.  being only three blocks away from union square saved us time and money and meant that we could easily walk to other areas such as chinatown and the civic centre.  excellent position, close to union sq. good for family of 6 adults. instructions from taso good. everything ran smoothly.the house is right in the city center, short walk to union square and westfield. rooms are spacious and quite at night. taso\\'s daughter came to the house on our arrival day, helped us to find a parking space in front of the  house, really appreciated it.

of cool bars and coffee joints. would definitely recommend this as a place to stay, thanks for the hospitality taso. the house was absolutely beautiful, clean and a real home from home.  the area was

had a great stay at taso\\'s house! the location was perfect for us, and everything was very neat and clean. it was very well equipped with utensils, pans, and everything else that we needed for a longer stay. the garage was very useful, since street parking in sf can be a challenge!\\r\\nthanks taso!what a phenomenal little spot to stay in san francisco. the location was absolutely perfect, and all the little touches really enhanced our trip. we were steps away from a number of great restaurants (thank you taso for leaving recommendations) and a quick walk to union square. the rooms were well appointed, and everything was clean and ready. it was great being able to reach the host whenever we had a question. i would definitely recommend staying in this house, and would rebook in a second for my next trip to san francisco. love it! very pretty house, my family and i had a good time over there!it\\'s a very nice house of taso\\'s. a few days before we get in, taso provided us with a page on how to get in and how to find the place. when we get in, we find it a very big and bright house. we all love the room, the bed, and the kitchen. so we\\'d like to recommend taso\\'s house to everyone who will travel around san francisco. thank you, taso.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe have eight people lived there. here are some of their comments.\\r\\n\\r\\nsnow: we love to stay in the house. it feels safe. furniture tiny. floor clean.\\r\\n\\r\\nsimon: really sweet house and thanks for kindly sharing, except there\\'s some smell in the air. and wifi doesn\\'t cover the whole house, but that\\'s ok.\\r\\n\\r\\nwilliam: it’s nice layout of the room. it has a style. the living room is a nice place to relax and talk. good lighting. although on the second floor, there are many embedded skylight.\\r\\n\\r\\njian: bright and spacious rooms. a bottle of wine kindly prepared for us by taso. but, it was too late when we noticed that. we didn’t drink it. large kitchen, fully equipped. it is really nice if you’re a young couple, and have plenty of time to stay. you can make good use of the kitchen cooking delicious food. sofa very comfortable. i like it very much. :d\\r\\n\\r\\nzooboa: the overall feeling is good. bedrooms and bathroom are very clean. it would be better if we can have more quilt or blankets.we had a great time in this place.  was ideal location for getting anywhere in san francisco.we stayed in taso\\'s home for 5 nights in late june 2015 and we loved every minute of it. in the most perfect location (we practically walked everywhere), so homely and meticulously decorated to give it a warm and beautiful vibe. it\\'s hard to imagine you\\'d find something like it right in the middle of the city. we particularly loved the attention to detail: a generous bottle of wine left for us to enjoy, bath gels available in each shower, advice on local restaurants, etc, etc. i could go on and on. thank you taso for a memorable stay, i have no doubt that we\\'ll be back again. taso\\'s place was wonderful! great location and a beautiful apartment. he welcomed us with bottle of wine and was very easy to get in touch with for any questions. we used the garage (very narrow) which was a really excellent feature! i would definitely recommend staying here and hopefully i will be back! the house was very well situated, just a few minutes walk from union square. the house was exactly what we needed and as described. i’d recommend it for anyone wanting high quality accommodation in this area of san francisco. taso was a pleasure to deal with, everything was quick and efficient. the bottle of wine was a lovely touch. a centrally located property which provides all the little luxuries of home. no more than three blocks from union square and within a hop skip and jump from walgreens. \\r\\n\\r\\nwonderfully furnished house with three generous bedrooms, two bathrooms, large lounge, great dining area and a great kitchen. exactly as described. the host even provided coffee for our caffeine fix, and an incredible bottle of local sonoma red!! \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you for making our stay in san francisco such a joy and pleasure. \\r\\n\\r\\nlooking forward to our return in a few days. this was our second stay at the property and it was like returning home. all the amenities and comforts of home, in possibly the best location in the city. \\r\\n\\r\\ndo yourself a favour and book this listing. you will not regret it. the house near union square was incredible. it must be one of the only free standing houses that close to san fransisco\\'s cbd! the rooms were large and very spacious for my wife and 4 kids. the house was just perfect for us. one important thing to note is that there is a large number of homeless people in the tenderloin area of san fransisco, close to where the house is located, which can sometimes be a little confronting.love our stay!  we secured house early this year with taso, who is caring and welcoming.  his wonderful manager joie is also extra kind. she is prompt with feedback, even helped us with last minute early check in and with a few other things  through out our stay.  taso\\'s house is perfect in every way, for family or business visits, love it! :)  it has beautiful/elegant decorated rooms, comfortable beds, fully stock kitchen with plenty of dishes & bowls and pots for family cooking. upon arrival, \"our sfo home\" was clean/welcoming and cozy, its keyless entry is simple and makes everyone extra independent.   1 week long stay to attend javaone was none stop hectic...  feeling at home with quiet quick brakes was priceless, when surrounded by 100s of people, home is located 3 mins walk from the hilton. together, we truly enjoyed the open space, its privacy & location.  we are coming back next year & already look forward to our stay:)   thank you so much for having us taso and joie! :) lovely single-family home situated within short walking distance of union square and its surrounding attractions.  recently renovated with well-appointed kitchen and 2 full bathrooms.  we had grandma in the front bedroom (queen bed), our 3 boys (aged 9, 7 and 4) in the smaller bedroom linked to the main bedroom (king bed) via the \"jack and jill bathroom.  we very much enjoyed our stay and are already looking forward to next year\\'s trip to sf area!the host canceled this reservation 176 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we stayed at 611 jones st 3/21/16-3/25/16 with our 3kids and mother in law. 6 of us in all.  the location is great with 3 parking garages all within 3 blocks. the house has two updated bathrooms and a well appointed kitchen. the owner joie was very responsive to our needs and did a great job. i highly recommend this property.this is my first experience booking with airbnb. what a relevation. we got lucky with this last minute booking in central sf for an urgent family trip. the past reviews and the photos were an accurate guide to a wonderfully planned, furnished, stylish and comfortable home. the basic provisions and cooking facilities gave us eating options that you don\\'t get in apartments, ie cooking oil, sauces, etc. the home provided us with a sanctuary in a busy city but within walking distance to many local attractions. \\r\\nit is a gritty area and may not suit some. there are many homeless people in the area. treat them with respect and street smarts and they will leave you in peace. in addition, the street is frequented by emergency vehicles with sirens blaring through the day,but hey, you are in the middle of an international city.\\r\\nthe area is serviced by many and varied cafes, bars and small convenience stores within a block in each direction. we really appreciated this.\\r\\njoie and the team at dragonfly were helpful and responsive and made our stay that much more at ease.it\\'s a really good house. everything are prefect. the house is clean, location good, safety, we stay here 4 days have a very happy vacation.this house was a great find. it\\'s a one-story, stand-alone house that is very unique for the neighborhood, as it\\'s near the heart of downtown. it was very convenient for our family as a base to explore san francisco. the house is in excellent condition and had all the amenities that we needed. it\\'s very close to union square and multiple good restaurants. i would highly recommend it for a family or group.there was a bottle of wine at the kitchen, which is a nice gesture.such a convenient location that allowed my family to shop around downtown and union square. house is absolutely clean and we enjoyed the bottle of wine that given by joie. the host canceled this reservation 39 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.house was great. in very convenient location and adequately finished. joie was very easy to deal with and communication was speedy, happy to recommend. did i mention the view from the deck ? it has all the amenities you would need and want the wifi was awesome! \"i am a big techie this is a big deal for me\".  great comfortable beds with plenty of pillows & soft sheets.  fully loaded kitchen we mostly used it for breakfast mostly. all in all if you looking for a place to stay with an amazing view i would highly recommend it.melissa\\'s apartment was in a first class location and was beautiful...very well equipped including a complimentary bottle of wine which was welcomed after a long journey! melissa was great to communicate with ,  all correspondence was dealt with do kindly and promptly... very much appreciated!  thankyou the hosts made me, my husband, and my mother-in-law feel super welcome! they were super responsive, answering me very fast from checkin to checkout. they also left many groceries items for us: peet\\'s coffee, dark chocolate, wine, oj, half-half, nutella, etc. about the place: the deck is amazing, super relaxing and we loved to start and end the days there. the place was very clean and fresh. the location is really good, in a peaceful street in the hill of north beach, a few blocks away from union square. and their restaurants recommendations was spot on! thank you so much!!\\r\\nonly one observation my husband made me say for the tv people in the world: they don\\'t have cable yet, but they have roku. it did not bother me at all, but he wanted to watch the nfl.melissa handed me off to carlos, the property manager, who was very responsive and made checking in and out very easy. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is spotless and is very well maintained. in the morning there are sometimes wild parrot flocks flying around and chirping.\\r\\n\\r\\nback yard is a serene garden with lots of green. front yard is a balcony with an amazon view of the city. clean towels are provided, and washer/dryer are in unit. didn\\'t need to make any sacrifices between comfort and utility. \\r\\n\\r\\nlocation is terrific and i would room here again if i had the chance and would definitely recommend this to friends and family.\\r\\n\\r\\nthx,\\r\\n\\r\\nlongfeithe accommodations here were fantastic.  i stayed at the apartment with 3 other guests.  in addition to the bedrooms, the fold out couch and high-end air mattress were more than satisfactory for a couple nights of sleep.  there were plenty of extra sheets and pillows to go around and the apartment was as clean upon arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough it the previous occupants had to stay late, melissa was able to provide us with the code to the garage so we could store our luggage, rather than walking with it all day. several sets of keys were provided to us so there was not an issue when one or two of us left separately from the group.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould definitely stay again.thanks for a seamless process melissa, as far as i am aware the guests were extremely happy with their stay.\\r\\n\\r\\njessthe place was wonderful.  although we never got to see melissa or carlos, i\\'m assuming they were giving us full privacy.  had everything we needed for our stay at the place.  amazing view and deck.  location was the best and everything was a short walk away.   i would stay there again without any reservations!  thanks!!like all the previous reviews, melissa was extremely accommodating. always responded in less than 5 minutes. she let us check in a few hours earlier, which was nice because the weather was pretty nasty. she was also very helpful by providing addresses for additional parking. the place was nice and clean, amazing views from the front deck, and easy access to north beach and all the fun under the sun. highly recommend staying here if ever in the city/ telegraph hill  area! fabulous spot just below telegraph hill and a short stroll to north beach. definitely one of the better patios and views in the city. garage was helpful for parking. condo was very clean with two comfortable bedrooms, a nice living/dining area and clean and functional kitchen. the patio is perfect for sunsets and is very useable given its right off the living room. melissa was a fantastic host. super easy to get in and out and lots or helpful information.melissa was a wonderful host!  she was super responsive and helpful, and easy to get in touch with.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is exactly as listed, with gorgeous views of sf.  the apartment itself is super clean and cozy, the deck is lovely and has such stunning views of the city!  from start to finish this was a great experience for me. the booking process was very quick and all questions were answered quickly. the accommodation is in an excellent location and very tastefully decorated with all that you need from accommodation. the decking was a particularly great thing to have. would highly recommend to anyone interested.melissa was very accommodating and went out of her way to get my family this apartment. all questions we had were answered promptly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is just as it appeared on the website, lovely furniture, kitchen had everything, and the views were fabulous. great location and really quiet for sleeping. \\r\\n\\r\\nwill recommend to anyone we know heading to sf.\\r\\nbooked this apartment at last minute for my colleagues.  communication on booking was spot on with no issues.  the apartment was perfect.  my colleagues view on the apartment were \" sf was fantastic. great view, balcony, comfortable beds, and an overall great place to spend the night (or live, for that matter)\"all good - quick and pleasant trip. thanks for the hospitality!nice little apartment in a nice location.  this area is very hilly and you must be comfortable with climbing hills and steps.  beautiful view from the front deck, a nice place to just chill.  bathroom was fine, bit small for me but we managed to share with 4 adults.  the two bedrooms had nice beds and we slept well.   the couch in the den does open up for a makeshift bed for extra sleeping needs.  we did miss our normal cable channels but managed to entertain ourselves with netflix and hulu.  wifi worked great with multiple users.  we also used take out service called (url hidden) when we did not feel like hiking up and down the hills of san fran.the process as a whole was effortless. melissa was very reasonable and easy to communicate with. absolutely beautiful home and a very nice location. great restaurants within walking distance. accurate description and pictures provide by the host.this is a great apartment in a prime north beach location. the neighborhood is packed with awesome places to eat and drink and  the apartment is only a few blocks from coit tower. it was comfortable and cozy. we never met melissa due to her other commitments but she gave us good directions, was available by phone, and made our stay smooth and simple. very last minute request to stay at melissa\\'s apartment, she was very helpful, response times were very quick and she made the whole process easy. apartment fabulous. will be returning. \\nthe apartment was just perfect! we had a baby with us and magically there was a crib, high chair and baby tub in the apartment at our arrival. i used to live in north beach and i have to say that the location is exactly where we wanted to stay, far enough from the bars, restaurants, and tourists and close enough that we could hop over for an amazing coffee or meal in less than 5 mins. parking is key if you have a car because you can only park for 2hrs on the street without a permit. the apartment is amazing! the view of downtown and the transamerica building is amazing from the living/dining room. the kitchen, apt has all the high end amenities including washer/dryer, gaz stove, central heating/ac and bosh dishwasher. the apartment is very quiet and you will sleep well because the rooms give onto the back yard and the soundproofing is quite good between the rooms (i could barely hear the baby from the other room). we had a slight problem with the internet and in no-time carlos stopped-in to fix the problem and chatted with us about the new restaurants in the neighborhood. which we then promptly went to try out, tony\\'s pizza! not to be missed, high end, pizzeria. yum. we had a lovely time, we wish we could have stayed longer.incredible location and views.  you can even see the bay view bridge lights at night.  would definitely stay again.what a wonderful 3 day stay we had at melissa\\'s apartment.  everything was as it was advertised, the location was great, melissa was very timely in her responses and the deck and views were a major treat!  i would definitely book this same apartment again. thank you, thank you!!!one of the best airbnbs i\\'ve stayed in. very clean. very quiet street. beautiful evening views. and the hill will give you enough exercise that it won\\'t matter what you eat in this great city. enjoyed melissa\\'s place immensely. perfect for 3 people. thanks!great location and an awesome apartment. clean, cosy with all amenities. the wifi could be improved and perhaps a few tea bags for us tea drinkers would be a nice touch.beautiful apartment and a gracious host. i really enjoyed my stay.great location and very easy communication. would definitely recommend. i booked melissa\\'s apartment for a colleagues business trip and she absolutely loved it. the apartment was fantastic and was the area and melissa herself.my business partner and i were in sf for three days of business meetings.  this location was perfect, close to our meeting, restaurants, and convenient to get aroundvery nice part of town - telegraph hill made us look at san francisco through a new set of eyes. stunning location a few steps away from hustle of columbus street - yet tucked away on a quiet street overlooking the bay. the apartment itself is very practical, well-equiped, cozy and the terrace is amazing - with a fair bit of sun we certainly enjoyed it. melissa provided great instructions for getting there and our stay. many thanks and will definitely come back again!great stay in san francisco. the appartment and the view  are just amazing. we were three colleagues coming for an event at the moscone center. great to stay in this area near the coit tower, telegraph hill is one of my preferred part of the town.\\r\\nmelissa was always here to answer our interrogations.\\r\\ni would definitively advise this appartment for a stay in sf.wonderful central location with a ton of stuff within walking distance, modern accommodations and parking available. melissa place is very well located and it is a very calm neighborhood with all the classic houses and up and down streets, apartment is nicely and  well equiped you can be sure that you will enjoy the time in melissa apartmentwe had a great time in san francisco.  the apartment\\'s location was super convenient for us. melissa\\'s apartment is superb, ineed. it was exactly as advertized: clean, well decorated, super convenient (walking distance) to many tourist locations and in a neighborhood with lots of great bars/restaurants. it was perfect for my husband, two sons and myself, but we would go back with another couple or by ourselves, as well. we were greeted by a gentleman who coordinates the cleaning. he had great tips, was friendly and made us feel as though he would be available shoudl anything arise. the view! this place is great. melissa was so easy to work with, and made sure we had a smooth arrival. this place has everything you need. interior is spacious and the rooms are very nice, both with access to a back patio. my favorite part though, the deck, it was a great place to work and relax in the evenings. you may not be staying here that much though. just a short walk down the hill supplies you with great food (mainly italian) and wide selection of bars for a nightcap. if you are feeling adventurous, you can walk about 15 minutes to the bart and explore the entire city.  you won\\'t be disappointed with this place.this place is amazing. melissa was wonderful too. whenever we needed anything she was available, even when we left our charger in the home after check out. the pictures do not do it justice. and the location is so close to everything. the property was  perfect--just as advertised.  close to countless restaurants and right in the middle of so many things to do.  it was clean, nicely decorated, and melissa was great to deal with.really enjoyed the pied-a-terre that melissa provided while on a business trip to sf.  usually you can get stuck in the area near the convention location, and this 2br is close enough to all the business locations while providing a fresh point of view to the city.  right outside north beach, on telegraph hill, plenty of restaurants and nightlife within a walking distance.  \\r\\nclean, clear, and easy to manage, i highly recommend this home/apt for overnight guests in san francisco.had a great stay! place is spotless and quiet, host was very helpful, and getting around town was a synch. i booked last minute, but melissa approved my stay and everything went smoothly. bring a coat, it\\'s freezing in north beach! wonderful. \\nmelissa is very easy to deal with abs responsive, with a sense of humour too!\\nunit is as described; deck is a real perk as is the parking spot (frankly the parking is \"tight\" but having a place to park in that area is huge!). \\nfloor to upstairs is not overly insulated re: noise so if the folks upstairs are clunking around late or early, you will know. the neighbourhood is however totally quiet and lovely with great restaurants and bars a mere minutes away. kitchen is nice and pretty well stocked. \\nall-in-all a lovely and easy stay. totally recommended! even better than the pictures. very impressed. loved the area, great location.  communication was great - check in was easy. would recommend to anyone.great place, it was clean and comfortable.  owner was very responsive to texts when needed.  i was traveling with some friends and meeting up in san francisco.  we were welcomed to the apartment (with a view from the front deck down over the bay bridge) by a bottle of wine and some helpful local tips.\\r\\nthe flat was cosy for 5 of us (one couple/three singles) but we were very comfortable spread out between all the sleeping options (2x beds, sofa bed, extremely comfortable auto-inflating mattress).  all the facilities were clean and well-kept, and served us very well.\\r\\nthe location is pretty wonderful, although it\\'s worth bringing your hiking boots - walking back up the hill can be a bit daunting, especially after a big meal!  that said, we sampled a few of the local food spots and it was probably a good thing that we were forced to burn off some of the calories afterwards!\\r\\nunfortunately we weren\\'t able to meet melissa this time around, however all the communication prior to arrival made everything extremely simple.  would definitely return and recommend!we stayed four nights at melissa\\'s place and had a wonderful time. the place is clean and in very good shape and has to nice bedrooms. the bath is ok -  though it could be a little bit bigger. \\nthe deck is wonderful an you have a great view on the transamerica pyramide and on the bay bridge. \\nthe place is absolutely quite what is unusual for sf. and it\\'s just a 5 minute walk and you are in the center of north beach. the way back you have to manage a steep hill - but we saw this as our workout. \\nwe did not meet melissa or carlos in person but the communication was smooth and fast. \\na big plus is the garage and an absolutely must if you have a car. \\nwe would definetly consider to stay there again. hi melissa,\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you so much for having us at your apartment. we absolutely love the place. it was clean, simple and exactly what you describe on your listing. the deck and location were awesome! we walked to fisherman wharf, china town, italy town, union square, pier 39. \\r\\ncarlos was really helpful and responsive and we appreciate that. he recommended a few restaurants and we tried them all. the food was so delicious. \\r\\nwe will be back soon and hope to meet you in person this time. oh! and we really enjoyed the bottle of wine as well. thank you :-)the rooms are so clean and cozy! everything is very well decorated. the view from the huge patio is pretty amazing. the garage (which is on a hill) space is just big enough for an intermediate suv. the host responded to our msgs within minutes. the coit tower is just 5 mins away by walking. beautiful neighborhood! i enjoyed walking around and everything about the place. for anyone staying at the property check out the view from montgomery stairs and the lights of coit tower at night!we loved melissa\\'s place. it was plenty large for the five of us with two in each bedroom and one on the convertible couch. the kitchen is well equipped and that helped us save $ with the san francisco restaurants being excellent but not cheap.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe patio/ deck really was the best part for me. it enhanced our vacation experience. melissa was very attentive to our needs. i suspect that we will return.melissa was great. the place was great, clean and in a great location. the views are amazing. no complaints.the apartment was awesome and the view wasn\\'t bad either :) perfectly located in the city to get to just about everything. i would definitely stay there again. this lovely little apartment is perfectly situated for exploring north beach and a short walk to the ferry building and many other attractions. everything was in good working order and very clean, instructions for access were very clear, and we had wonderful breakfasts on the porch. be advised to bring the cushions inside on those foggy summer nights if you prefer a dry place to enjoy your morning coffee! melissa left us a nice welcome bottle of wine, and there were basic condiments available as well as a loaf of bread... not that we ate in much with all the choices nearby. (we highly recommend costogna, and a bit farther afield, range on valencia. plus réveille is a short walk for coffee and pastries and wonderful eggs on toast). be aware that it is a cozy apartment if the weather is inclement and the porch not usable. we were 4 and filled up the space just perfectly. it was a nice touch to have shampoo and conditioner available for the forgetful amongst us. also, it is a real bonus to have the garage available, but only for smaller cars and careful with the clearance on the pavement. we have a lexus hybrid that is pretty small and i wouldn\\'t want to park anything larger! all in all, a great stay, even if the fireworks were predictably foggy from up at coit tower. this is a great neighborhood.this is a lovely home located on telegraph hill only a few blocks from coit tower. if you are driving or walking, be aware that the streets are crazy steep in this area, but that\\'s what makes it fun and provides the house with great views of the financial district. from the street there are great views of nob hill, russian hill, and the bay bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is a short walk to the little italy area and washington square park with many shops and restaurants, and chinatown not far beyond. fisherman\\'s wharf and the financial district are both about a half mile away.\\r\\n\\r\\nno question, the deck is one of the great features of the house, and every evening and morning, when we weren\\'t walking up to coit tower, we were out on the deck. the house was clean and matched up with the description and photos, and melissa was a helpful host. we didn\\'t actually use the kitchen, but it seemed well provisioned. we\\'d definitely stay here again.this was our first trip using airbnb and we stayed in 5 locations altogether so we have waited until our return home in order to compare them and offer fair reviews as we had no previous experience to determine, for example, what a 5-star experience should feel like.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is in a peaceful neighbourhood with local groceries, bakeries, cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance, though remember this part of sf is very hilly. it is about 10 minutes\\' walk to the nearest bus route.\\r\\n\\r\\nit was clean and well appointed with modern amenities and furniture. the deck looks towards the bay bridge and is a great spot for breakfast or evening drinks. it is genuinely private and not overlooked (as far as we could tell!). \\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa had kindly left us a bottle of wine. there were some groceries from previous tenants, e.g. coffee, butter, etc. melissa was easy to contact, responsive, polite and helpful. we communicated by mobile phone and text.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space is described as having 2 bedrooms and 4 beds, though we could only find 2 double beds. after we had left we learned more about the way the airbnb site details the space and it turned out that there was a pull-out sofa-bed and an inflatable though we didn\\'t find the latter. in the event the kids shared a bed and we all slept well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe garage is underneath the apartment and is very tight, but manageable with care in an average-sized saloon car. the garage entrance has a steep kerb, but we figured out that taking it at an angle avoided grounding the car on the pavement.\\r\\n\\r\\nas a family we agreed we would use the apartment again.beautiful appartment in an amazing location. very peaceful, but great restaurants and quirky shops nearby, and only a 15 minute walk to fisherman\\'s wharf, china town and great shopping. very well equipped. we had a great time. just be warned - the beautiful view comes at a price - it is at the top of a steep hill with very steep steps up to the front door.the location of melissa\\'s appartment is just great!\\r\\neverything is close.\\r\\nvery nice place, very nice view.\\r\\na place to go, for sure.\\r\\nthis place is awesome. everything is as advertised. very clean, well-stocked. the deck is fantastic as well. as mentioned in previous reviews the neighborhood is hilly, but with that comes great views. we will definitely stay here again. thanks melissa!great place to stay in the north beach area! easy walk to shopping and restaurants, but be warned that the location is at the top of some steep hills. walking from the bart would not be advised.\\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa was very responsive and the description of the unit was very accurate. the cleaning crew was still inside when we arrived, but we just had a glass of wine on the deck while we waited. no big deal. speaking of the deck and view, its amazing.the location is great and the place is just as it appears on pictures, nice and comfortable.\\r\\nmelissa and carlos were extremely prompt in their responses to our questions. the apartment photos are completely accurate. everything is neat, new and in good working order. there is plenty of closet space. the space is beautiful and very comfortable. the deck is a phenomenal place to relax and enjoy a glass of wine and wonderful views of the city and bay bridge. we took some great photos from that vantage point. the location is excellent. you are within walking distance to many attractions and neighborhoods. the hills are steep, so bring your sneakers or your uber app. the entrance stairs are very steep, so i would not recommend this apartment to anyone with mobility issues. however, for anyone else, you really could not do better in terms of location and comfort.melissa and carlos were prompt and courteous, and both of their units were in perfect condition for our stay. the location is extremely hard to beat, overlooking downtown sf and the bay from the side of telegraph hill. it\\'s a shame the patio use is fairly restrictive, but it\\'s completely understandable given the proximity to neighboring windows. \\r\\n\\r\\na great spot that we\\'ll gladly think of staying in again the next time our team visits sf!awesome location and deck!  melissa was very responsive and we had a great time!this place is great. loved the location and amenities. melissa made everything super simple for our stay. thanks again!the apartment was perfectly located and everything was so easy. we had everything that we needed for a comfortable stay. i would thoroughly recommend this place to anyone. any questions that i had were answered really quickly. thank you so much.our family really enjoyed our stay. it\\'s in a fun the location, with a number of amazing views views within a couple block radius. the accommodations are really nice, the deck is as good as advertised. melissa was fast to respond, accommodating, and the instructions were very detailed. the home and host were great!

\\r\\n\\r\\ni was there with my parents and two other friends and we were very pleased. the deck and the location are the highlights of this listing. you will be at a walking distance from many spots you will want to visit, from great restaurant options and good nightlife options. \\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa was a great host and we definitely felt welcome. all the information needed was available to us.listing was accurate. great place.great place!

we arrived to a bottle of sparkling wine and felt very welcomed. carlos was very helpful with the check in and check out process and responded very promptly. the apartment is incredibly comfortable and the location so close to shops, city center, restauirants, bars... and all of its is incredible. \\r\\nit was great to be able to take breakfast out on the terrace. melissa was able to accommodate us quickly when we requested a reservation and when we asked her about differents things to manage. \\r\\nhaving a garage was useful-- note that it best serves a small car. overall, i highly recommend the flat!very good apartments with everything what you need inside. nice and very quiet district. cozy terrace with amazing view, especially in evening. we stayed in melissa\\'s on a business trip. it is very conveniently located (easy access to the financial district as well as to north beach itself), is very well equipped and has gorgeous views to boot. in addition, and a huge plus in san francisco, it has its own parking. a great place, would definitely try to book it again on my next trip.everything was organized perfectly! i had a great week in this nice apartment and would book again without a doubt. thanks!what a wonderful place!  great location walking distance to great dining and shops.   place slept 5 comfortably.  highly recommend.  great place! loved being able to park without worry and the deck was awesome. what a beautiful home! my colleague and i enjoyed our stayed immensely in this comfortable two bedroom apartment. it was as described and well equipped with everything we could ask for. the neighborhood is a perfect combination of residential, in close proximity, and great food and entertainment steps away. some of the best views of the city are located near this location. it also felt safe, so it was a great place to explore even after sunset. thanks for your hospitality, melissa!the place was in great shape, clean, comfortable and a lot of fun. we enjoyed being a short walk away from north beach restaurants (we especially liked cafe baonecci and san francisco activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nhost was helpful in coordinating check in and responsive.great place and great location.melissa was very prompt with confirming my booking and getting me the site access instructions just prior to my family\\'s arrival. she also very nicely handed me off to her business partner to work with because she was out of town. melissa\\'s business partner was also attentive and very easy to work with.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe site itself was very beautiful. the deck and views are incredible as promised. the apartment was clean and reasonably furnished. the fact that there is a garage space is excellent. be advised that due to the nature of the stall, the space is narrow. our rented kia soul fit just fine. the oldsmobile in the next stall was a very tight fit.\\r\\n\\r\\ni think it is important to realize that while it is remodeled, this is not an apartment in a new building; instead it is an apartment in a classic older san francisco walk-up. as such it is not pin-drop silent inside, nor sound isolated from the unit upstairs, and the entry to either unit involves climbing a steep set of external concrete stairs. taking these considerations into account helps to level-set expectations. to be clear this airbnb is in a great location, with fantastic views, has secure off-street parking for one car, and a reasonable sf price.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe definitely enjoyed our stay.melissa\\'s place was great. very clean, wonderful location and was a large space for the price. would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a place close to the action, but quiet. melissa place is great! great location and beautiful apartment! clean and neat!the loft was beautiful and we really enjoyed itthe place was great. the hosts are very easy to get a hold of and all of their directions and descriptions are accurate. the accommodations were comfortable, the deck is a really nice feature...i only wish we had more time to use it. i always enjoy walking around san francisco, so the location was perfect since so many things are within close proximity and, if you need to venture out a little further, public transportation is close by as well. i would definitely stay there again. melissa\\'s home was amazing and just like the pictures. it\\'s a perfect location to enjoy the city. we had a great weekend!we didn\\'t see melissa,but she arrange everything well. it\\'s nice place as the pics. and in good location,it\\'s convinent to go everywhere by walk. except the bad weather . we feel good to live in her apartment .\\nlisting was exactly like the photos and yes, the deck is as amazing as it looks! melissa was extremely responsive, as was her friend carlos who helped while she was out of town. no fuss, no problems!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space is great - two bedrooms, living area, but the highlight is absolutely the deck. i wanted to take more advantage of it, but the weather was not in our favor.\\r\\n\\r\\ni will say that if you\\'re looking for a silent, non disturbed sleep - note that the ceilings are thin, so you do hear the people upstairs walking around. didn\\'t bother us, but worth noting.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is perfect - get ready to walk up a lot of hills and tone those buns! great stay here. thanks melissa!property is on a quiet road but close to retail and restaurants etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nflat is clean with comfortable furnishings and beds and uses a convenient lock box system to simplify checking-in and checking-out of the property.\\r\\n\\r\\ngood communication from host.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you.fantabulous experience, great location and atmosphere. cannot wait to go back!melissa and carlos were great and very helpful. this was our very first airbnb experience so i was a little anxious about the whole trip. communications were prompt and all my questions were answered quickly. carlos suggested trip itineraries and things to do around the bay area. check in and other instructions were very simple and the place was wonderful and exactly as described. all the amenities were available and extras items were easy to find. house is clean and comfortable. i wouldn\\'t recommend this place if you are older and can\\'t regularly walk up and down the steep small stairs and the big hill which the house is on. we had a blast and the central location of this place made everything easy to get to. all major attractions were within walking distance and short uber/lyft ride away so you don\\'t need a rental car unless you plan to drive outside of the city. the view from the house was wonderful and it just brings a smile to your face every morning and night. i would definitely recommend this place when you are in town!the home was tastefully decorated.   very clean, uncluttered, well appointed, great location.  the host was very quick to respond to any inquiries.  we would definitely stay here again.   thoughtful and accommodating setup.   deck can\\'t be beat!   garage for parking is an a plus.great apartment in outstanding location. we stayed with 3 kids. 14 yr old slept ok on foldout couch although poor curtains in living space and light outside front door disturbed his sleep. otherwise, apartment has everything, great kitchen, linen, clean, and is in a fabulous spot.host makes you feel very welcome. excellent communication, and check in and out were a breeze. if the place hadn\\'t been in such a perfect location we had may never left to enjoy the city. the place was beautiful and clean. a+ hostwhat a great apartment! it was huge- and the outdoor patio was such a treat for the warm weather last week. the location is also great if you work downtown- i was able to walk to my office on howard street in 20 minutes and avoid the madness of the morning commute.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment itself is great- two big bedrooms, nice sized living room with a big tv. we were able to watch netflix on the tv which was nice. there\\'s also a washer dryer in unit. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was great to have a garage for parking. we had rented a car, having been in town for work, and enjoyed the convenience of not having to look for a spot each day. the directions for the house were super clear and the check-in/check-out process was super professional!family and i had a wonderful time at melissa\\'s apartment! can\\'t beat the location, views and excitement of san francisco! \\r\\nthe apartment was very clean and stylish  and the patio is just amazing \\r\\nthanks melissa for a great experience and visit! had a great visit and this place was wonderful. it fit my family well and we loved having a large deck to relax on. location was great and within walking distance to many nice restaurants. also can walk to the piers in about 15 min. the apartment is located on a steep hill (welcome to san francisco), but that also means you have a nice view from the deck. thanks!\\nfantastic home in the heart of sf! minutes away from everything. melissa was an excellent host and we couldn\\'t ask for more! \\nthe view was an added bonus! would definitely stay here again. awesome stay. apartment is fantastic and absolutely like described (even better). location is perfect (quiet with a great view and restaurants, bars etc around the corne.\\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa has been a perfect host. communication was great - always responded very quickly on every question. \\r\\n\\r\\nfantastic stay - next time again.great apartment in a lovely neighborhood. the deck is a huge plus, with a lovely view on san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nindoors, everything is nice and in good condition.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would certainly stay here again.getting settled in was really simple. melissa was great. when we arrived (30 minutes before check in) the cleaner was still cleaning up and let us right in. she was great and friendly. location was really nice - lots of great places to eat and go that were really nearby. \\r\\n\\r\\nviews from the deck were great. melissa did a great job communicating ahead of our stay.  the location was outstanding basically a walk from many of the best places in sf. close to amazing italian town restaurants and china town.  the 2 bed 1 bath condo is perfect for 2 - 3 people, and the deck was super fun. the condo is basically atop telegraph hill though, so get ready for hills if you walk, which we loved.  clean, well furnished, as advertised.it was in a  great location and the house is as seen in the pictures. had a great time. this apartment was perfect for our weekend in sf.  location was great and the the huge deck was ideal for coffee in the mornings and cocktails in the evening.  very clean place and easy and friendly communication with the hosts.\\r\\nwould definitely stay here again if i came back to san francisco.  loved it! melissa was fantastic- super responsive and extremely helpful! the apartment is in a great location and well appointed- smaller bathroom in terms of sharing between four adults but manageable for a short stay. all in all wonderful experience!beautiful space. super clean and spacious. very welcoming. would definitely stay here again if i am in the area. robert and louise are excellent  host. the place is really clean. it\\'s located in very convenient area - just couple steps from caltrain and metro station. safeway and starbucks are just downstairs. \\r\\nwalking distance to moscone center. highly recommended! robert was away at the time of my stay but co-ordinated my arrival extremely well. the room was beautifully made up, and was in the perfect location for exploring the city. i really enjoyed my stay here, due to the care and attention that robert put into my stay.we had a great time staying here. this is a nice couple, clean place and super awesome dogs. great room with great location and great host. it is awesome room with ideal location and safe even if you walking alone at night this is my first experience ever using airbnb.  i was a little apprehensive but i can honestly say that i had a fantastic experience.  this place is beautiful.  very spacious four bedroom apartment on the 1st floor, with access to the roof for an amazing view of the gg bridge.    the apartment was very clean and well furnished.   it\\'s an older style apartment but well maintained and very quiet (no noisy neighbors or people waking above us upstairs). the neighborhood was quiet and is within a 5 minute drive to north beach restaurants and less than a 15 minute drive to down town.  rolando, was very friendly and responsive and he made us feel very welcome.  parking can be a bit of a challenge at night but there is plenty of taxi and uber transit available.  bottom line:  spacious, clean apartment in a safe neighborhood, close drive to everything and a really courteous host.   i highly recommend this place!we had some important clients and vp of the company come stay with us for gdc. rolando was amazing and always asked if he could do anything. our guests said the house was great with no complaints. we would definitely book this house again!rolando was a great host. i believe he ran into a problem with the hot water heater but he proactively communicated to me and had it resolved before we got there. kept in contact and was very responsive to text messages.  access to the unit was simple and straight forward. we reserved the parking spot which was wonderful since parking that area is a battle and we had kids with us. area is really clean, upscale part of sf, very safe.  we had 4 kids(1 toddler) and we never were concerned even for a bit. the place is very spacious and clean and fit our group of 7 perfectly.  i was very happy with the accommodations and we had a great time.  i highly recommend staying here if you get a chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nperfect location near the wharf , lombard street, polk street, laundrymat, and safeway grocery!

 we had a minor few issues while staying (url hidden) of the queen beds was broken and completely unusable (luckily we had an extra bedroom to sleep in), lots of trash was left outside the kitchen door in the hallway and we had some issues with the starter on the grill on the oven that was malfunctioning when the oven got hot.  i contacted rolando and he responded fairly quickly about the trash but never responded about the oven which we were most concerned about.  there is a view of the gg bridge from the roof but it\\'s difficult to find the staircase that will take you there. you cannot see  the bridge from any windows in the apartment. we appreciated being able to park in the garage since parking is so hard to find in san fran.  i would recommend this home but don\\'t expect (url hidden) old and just average but worked for our family.nick was very welcoming and helpful.\\r\\nhe did everything to make us feel comfortable at all times. \\r\\n\\r\\nhe has beautiful home and a great area!\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks nick! great place - the apartment was perfectly located and comfortable.  i was there with some colleagues for a work trip and we couldn\\'t have been happier.  nice was very welcoming and accommodating - a great host!a family apartment in a hip location.  we wanted to stay in the mission district and nick\\'s house is in the best location: tartine, delfina, bi-rite, bi-rite creamery and dolores park café all on the same block. j-church muni line just 2 blocks away. mission life flows past the sitting room bay window, but the house and particularly the bedrooms are very quiet. nick made us very welcome in his home. and it is very homely. fully stocked kitchen and everything you need in the bathroom. clean and very comfortable. pretty back garden. i sent nick a few queries by sms and he answered very quickly - very helpful.nick\\'s house is extremely welcoming, clean, cosy, and well located at the heart of the mission district. my guests felt at home right away. nick is also a great host; he made himself available physically and on the phone at anytime. he also gave recommendations.my wife and i got married and needed a place for some of our guests. nick was very helpful and our friends loved his place. very accommodating, great experience. my colleagues and i stayed at nick\\'s for an international medical conference for 4 nights. using the j line we were able to get to the convention centre (moscone) within 15-20 minutes.  he welcomed us with such a clean home. the location is great and very close to a grocery store and an amazing ice cream place. there are also cute cafes around. the home is so cozy and gave my colleagues and i the real feel of san fran!the stay has been very nice , the house is as in the photos , warm , cozy and well located. nick respode very fast, which we appreciate a lot. we recommend itour stay was excellent. nick was very flexible around check in and check out times which helped us immensely. \\ngreat location and house was spacious and comfortable !\\nthanks again nick for your hospitality the reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.tova was hands down the best host!  she gave me a tour of the space, her neighborhood (which is amazing) and even brought me to her favorite corner coffee shop and pizza place.  i seriously couldn\\'t think of a better san francisco local experience.  one hundred stars!!!jack and christina were amazing hosts, and their home was beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\ntheir home is a short walk to the 24th mission bart station in a great neighborhood. i was blown away by their hospitality - breakfast consisted of english muffins, fruit, juice, greek yogurt, as well as coffee and tea (although i declined the latter). when i came in at night, i was greeted with freshly made hummus and sliced peppers.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home is beautifully restored and decorated very well. it\\'s a historic home with period paintings, art, and furniture. the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very clean, and fresh towels were provided every morning throughout my stay, and my bed was turned down every evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is near a bart stop and took about an hour of travel from the airport to their home (walking and bart). i would also take bart from their home to powell (where moscone is). that was about a 30-minute trip as long as bart didn\\'t have any delays.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy only regret is that i didn\\'t spend more time enjoying jack and christina\\'s balcony, backyard, and neighborhood. i was attending dreamforce 2015, so i was gone early in the morning and would return later in the evening. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was my first time using airbnb, and i was very lucky to get such  amazing hosts. while the price was a little more than others, it was totally worth it. great breakfast, evening snack, artisan soaps, incredibly clean, fresh towels, privacy, snacks (protein bars, nuts, drinks), and in what felt like a safe neighborhood. they paid attention to all of the little details, and made me feel like i was visiting with friends.\\r\\n\\r\\na wonderful experience!spent one week in this great room! excellent room very cozy and private!\\r\\ncamilla is also a great host. very knowledgeable about food, wine and destinations to see, eat or experience in san francisco or anywhere else for that matter. she is an exceptional host. i literally ate and drank too much good food and beverages during my stay. most fun i have had in years. in the immortal words of general macarthur  \"i shall return!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmarlowespencer house is amazing. i travel a lot and arrange accommodation from camping through to 5 star hotels and i can honestly say that my stay with camila was one of the most unique experiences i\\'ve had. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is pristine and quite simply a work of art.  the level of attention to detail is stunning and it\\'s just not possible for any online pictures, however good, to do it justice. in person, every nok and cranny of the house is perfect, even the downstairs toilet has symmetrical, perfectly aligned wall paper (or should i describe it as a mural or a freeze) on the ...ceiling!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bed was..... i felt like a cross between a princess and a roman goddess, or the man in the moon sleeping on this.....cloud!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is also incredibly convenient. it\\'s near to a totally divine, traditional italian supermarket that has everything and it\\'s also minutes away by bus from the marina and downtown and a 1 minute walk from the busy end of haight street (haight/ashbury).\\r\\n\\r\\nif you\\'re looking for something totally unique, luxurious, personal, romantic, exciting.... then book this place immediately. if you\\'re um\\'ing and arming and can\\'t decide..... book this place.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you camila and carol for being such lovely hostesses and being so warm.\\r\\n\\r\\njessicaalright. this is not going to be a short review, simply because there are just far too many wonderful qualities of camila and her gorgeous bed and breakfast. from the moment i contacted camila with queries about spencer mansion, she has been remarkably quick and thorough with her responses. my husband and i stayed at the spencer mansion for 8 nights. the rooms and common spaces are incredibly gorgeous, clean and comfortable. i had initially looked at hotels in sf, but fell in love with spencer. it beats the pants off any hotel in the city. the location is great. it\\'s very close to haight-ashbury, and transportation downtown is super easy with buses running right outside the house. \\r\\n\\r\\ncamila took care of our every need. we shared food, drink, stories and warmth with her and other guests for several unplanned gatherings around the giant kitchen table. \\r\\n\\r\\ni am a sucker for cats, and i met two of the most wonderful cat-guardians-of-the-house during our vacation. their names are marco and polo. they are gentle and friendly. don\\'t worry if you are allergic. marco and polo have very specific areas that they stay in, and never go into the hallways, rooms, living room or kitchen.  \\r\\n\\r\\nour bed was very comfy and cozy. we had an adorable breakfast alcove by the bay windows where we had our coffee and read the news every morning. \\r\\n\\r\\nit is actually my dream to eventually own a bnb. i have been to many, and they have always lacked personality and quality. spencer house was the first house that is close to what i would want to run, and camila is my role model. we had a lovely time, my sister really loved it!  camila is a super host, and the house is truly fantastic.  many thanks!\\r\\n\\r\\ncheers!the spencer mansion is stunning in every detail. meticulous renovation to this historic beauty is a treat to the eyes. the innkeeper camila is as friendly and giving of her time as previous reviewers have indicated. she personally walked me to a local sushi joint (tsunami). her hospitality exceeded my high expectations. the haight-ashbury neighborhood has lovely eateries, coffee houses and dessert bars, all within a few blocks. don\\'t miss the climb to the top of buena vista park, just across from the mansion.outstanding home that will not disappoint. extremely comfy and in a great location.for my first trip to san francisco, i feel i really found a gem in this city.  the spencer mansion is beautifully restored, and it has a wonderful mix of restored charm and modern comforts (with its own bathroom and shower, free wi-fi, and common access to a computer and printer).  \\r\\n\\r\\nalso since i chose to not rent a car, it was really convenient that the muni stop headed towards downtown is literally right in front of the house.  which is a great option, but thanks to cami\\'s amazing advice i also enjoyed quite a few great restaurants that are all within walking distance (just a few blocks) from the house. \\r\\n\\r\\nand walking around this haight-ashbury area - is a real treat - it is a beautiful and tranquil neighborhood.  \\r\\n\\r\\nand as other reviewers have pointed out - cami is a huge factor of what makes spencer mansion such a warm and welcoming stay.  and then add to that cami\\'s generous advice on great places to eat or take in around the city.   i strongly suggest following her guidance to the delight of your taste buds.   splendid house and lovely host. the spencer mansion is a remarkably intact victorian house with gorgeous woodwork and period details. our room was comfortable and pretty. we enjoyed lounging in the parlor. we were visiting family in the haight so the location was perfect. the number 71 bus stops at the front door which is very convenient. \\r\\ncamila was very helpful and pleasant. we felt lucky to be staying in this museum-worthy house, and highly recommend it.our stay was perfect! camila is the best host, quick with a reply and knows all the great spots around town! \\r\\nspencer house is a treasure.  we recently returned for a second visit and were warmly welcomed by camila, edwin, and edna.  thank you again for a special experience!  \\r\\nwhat can be said about this most spectacular mansion?  it is a sight to behold and a joy to be in.  cami is a most delightful host, gracious and warm.  if you want to have a heightened and authentic san francisco experience then stay at the spencer house, a true victorian gem in a city filled with victorians.the spencer house is a special place.  we had an incredible weekend stay.. so beautiful and so comfortable!  i look forward to another visit!just plain wow! this was by far the best experience i\\'ve had on airbnb. cami was amazing with being so quick to reply when i needed a place at the very last minute for close to a week. the room it self was really unique as with every other room at the spencer house. having a shower and toilet in each room was just amazing. the house itself is situated right in front of a bus stop so getting around is super convenient. she even took time to take me around and discover various restaurants that were around the area. i will definitely come back to stay here again.  not only is the spencer mansion an incredible place to stay - unique and unlike any place i have been, camila is the most fantastic host. warm and welcoming to a whole new level!. i promise you wont be disappointed staying here : ) special place, run by a special girl!

cami and carol were very friendly and accommodating. we will most definately be staying at the spencer mansion come next outside lands!spencer house is the most beautiful place and cami is a beautiful host! she made us feel so welcome from our first contact and was full of insider tips to help us make the most of our first trip to san francisco. the house has an amazing history and our room was great, very spacious with great facilities and a lovely comfortable bed with beautiful linen. our stay at spencer house was the perfect beginning to our tour of the west, we were only sad we couldn\\'t stay longer and we hope to return soon! a really special place and host.in one word: awesome! the room is beautiful and both cami and carol make you feel welcome in an instant. the neighborhood is packed with good restaurants. i will definitely stay here again when i come back to san francisco.me and my husband stayed one week at spencer house- and we enjoyed it! spencer house is the best airbnb place i have been too. the room was so pretty and comfortable and the house was full of history. \\r\\ncami was an excellent host; warm, generous, helpful, and full of good reccomendations. \\r\\nhaight street was an interesting neighborhood. a lot of hippies :).  you could also go to other cool places nearby like hayes street and valencia (if you don\\'t like walking a lot there is a buss stop outside the spencer house). we would love to come back sometime!we always believe in serendipity, staying over at the spencer house was a beautiful serendipity! we got chance to meet (chat with) cami and carol, they are just great hosts (always with a genuine and warm smiles). the house has been amazingly decorated and maintained, into every single details. you immediately notice it embodies the passion, knowledge and personality of those two hosts. cami and caro gave us really useful information to explore san francisco. with their helps, we manage to visit all the must-sees, more interestingly we threw ourselves into vibrant corners of san francisco. (btw, the house itself is located in a neighborhood which has a lot of characters. )\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, welcome to your incomparable hotel california, it is sophisticated, fun and has \"no-ghost guarantee\" as caro promised :p\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks cami and caro.\\r\\nthis was my first time using airbnb and all i can say is that the spencer house has set the bar high! the house is amazing! countless times i saw people snapping photos from the outside, but the inside is even more incredible. the pictures really don\\'t do it justice. the house was bigger than i imagined and also very quiet. it had such an old antique feel, but with great cleanliness. the queen anne room was absolutely beautiful. the room was very clean, the bed was comfortable, and we were given fresh towels. the hosts were very nice, helpful, and accommodating. they even had a separate basket for us in the fridge to keep our things in. the neighborhood has so many great places to eat! it\\'s also located right by the bus stop so it\\'s super easy to get around the city. the house has its own parking spots on the street alongside the property, a true rarity in san francisco. my boyfriend and i were so sad to leave. the house made us feel at home and really gave us a local feel for san francisco. can\\'t wait to revisit and stay at the spencer house!we loved our stay at the spencer house!!  definitely our favorite airbnb(: thank you cami and carol for a perfect stay!!  cami and carol are fantastic hosts!  they are friendly, funny, and knowledgeable about the area.  spencer house is a beautiful old building with tons of charm, and the queen anne room is great.  this was my second stay there with my wife, and we don\\'t plan to stay anywhere else in san francisco as long as we can find a room here.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthis time around i was attending a conference downtown, and getting to and from spencer house was trivially simple.  a 20 minute bus ride each way made it very easy to get downtown and back (with buses running every 10 minutes).  spencer house is far more comfortable than a hotel room, costs significantly less, and the neighborhood has more shops, bars and restaurants than downtown.  i would say that everyone should stay here, except then it might be hard to get a room the next time i want to!my stay at the spencer house was fantastic!!! cami and carol are so kind and warm and suuuper smart and witty, i could hang out with these girls all day! i read a couple of their reviews and someone said they are very knowledgable... i learned so much in just the short amount of time getting to know them.  they really went out of their way to make me feel right at home and i appreciate that whole heartedly... they have special souls and it\\'s and you feel that right on the spot. i hope i get to come back again and this time bring my husband, such a wonderful trip it was...and not once did i get homesick, which in the end...was the truest stay of comfortable i felt there...3wow we had such an amazing time time here, our hosts were above and beyond fantastic! cami was so lovely to us, she made us feel so welcome and provided us with helpful restaurant recommendations and many tips to enjoy the city. we had a lovely evening sharing wine and stories with her and other guests, thank you cami! \\n\\nspencer house is such a great place to hang out and be happy in comfort and style! the house has been finished in the original style and the attention to detail is amazing, we stayed in the queen anne room and the bed is the comfiest i have ever slept in, soft linens and fluffy pillows! this has by far been the best airbnb experience we have had and we wish cami, carol and their family all the best for the future. \\n\\nwith warm regards\\n\\neloise & matt xxfrom the moment i stepped into the stunning spencer house, i knew i had made the right choice.  cami warmly welcomed me and shared the history of her home. the queen anne room was lovely, with views of the park and the bay to the north.  and surprisingly quiet.  a kitchen stocked with fruit, gourmet coffees, teas, and cookies was an unexpected treat.  but the highlight of my stay was the kindness and generosity of cami and carol.  they are lovely hosts and helped me feel like i was a most welcome guest!the spencer house deserves each one of its 5 stars and more. it\\'s one of san francisco\\'s gems and is the perfect combination of amazing hosts and unique home. there is so much warmth, generosity and hospitality in this house, you\\'ll leave feeling like part of the family. highly recommend staying here!great host. great neighborhood. great house. hands down the best listing i have stayed at. it\\'s one of those experiences you will never forget. got tons of recommendations from the hosts and felt like we were at home immediately on arrival. awesome stay. this is the second time i visited cami and carol in less than a year. now my default choice of accommodation whenever i am in sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks for having me and looking forward to visiting again soon :)fantastic location, beautiful house, comfortable room!  my 21 year old daughter and i stayed here for spring break and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  cami and carol responded very quickly via text to any questions.  it is a great neighborhood --we loved breakfast at grind, did yoga at yoga garden just 2 blocks away and my daughter took advantage of the vintage shopping on haight.  we were always able to find a parking place even late at night.  we felt like we were staying in downton abbey--the main rooms are so elegant!  it was very quiet our week so we didn\\'t see any other guests so we had some friends come over and join us in the formal dining room for drinks.  the room was very clean and comfortable.  you will really get the impression that they do all they can to make it a very nice place for guests.  we would stay here again and have recommended it to our friends.spencer house is amazing. this is the third time i am staying here. when travelling to sf i almost never look anywhere else, this is my home away from home!\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks cami and carol for an awesome stay, again. see you soon :)this was by far one of my best airbnb experiences. cami and carol were phenomenal hosts--really the ideal airbnb hosts. they went out of their way to make sure i had everything i needed, recommended great must-see sites in the city and strived to make sure i had the best experience possible. the mansion is absolutely beautiful and impeccably maintained. the room was private and quickly felt like home. i will most definitely stay here next time i am in sf. cami and carol were super inviting and pointed us toward some good food and activities. the house is gorgeous and exceeded our expectations.i stayed at carol & cami\\'s spencer house for three days. starting with the location, it is in a quite neighborhood, at the center of the city. there is a bus station just by the corner! where you can hop on to everywhere. plenty of restaurants and coffee shops are nearby. \\n\\nthe house itself is a pice of art. staying there is considered as part of the city experiences. be ready to sleep over the clouds in that cotton soft bed!!. bathroom is awesome. \\n\\ncami is such a wonderful person, she guided me to lots of awesome places and unforgettable experiences. she is responsive friendly, easy going and always helpful. \\n\\ni would absolutely love to stay there again!    \\nthis place is amazing - quite possibly the perfect way to visit sf. cami & carol have upgraded it in the right places, while still maintaining its historical charm. the bed is super comfortable, the bathrooms modern, & there is plenty of room to spread out. cami & carol are wonderful hostesses who went out of their way to make the home cozy. it is the perfect combination of private and shared space. the haight is a beautiful neighborhood and is a short bus ride away from the action downtown. i have already recommended this house to my friends & will definitely be returning. i had a great time staying here!cami and carol have a certain wonderful energy, which exudes a warm inviting spirit that signals \"spencer house is a safe place to be. you\\'re in the right place, we\\'ve got it under control.\" fantastic hosts in every way, what a real treat to have spent a week at spencer and in their company! \\r\\ncami and carol were terrific hosts with an impeccably tailored and well kept home that served as the perfect launching spot to explore san francisco and the surrounding area. they made us feel welcomed from the minute we walked in the door and handed us the key to our room. it is a beautiful and unique place to stay, and i would–and have already–recommend it to anyone visiting the city. we will certainly be repeat customers when we find ourselves back in the bay area.the room and house were amazing. the bed was fantastic and the house had all the amenities i needed for my stay. cami was attentive and accommodating throughout my stay. she invited me to her bbq and into her friend group like i was an old friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is also in a perfect location - there are amazing neighborhoods to explore within easy walking distance (along with golden gate park) and access to buses that took me right downtown. the house is really at the heart of san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all a great place to stay if you\\'re visiting for vacation or work.i love everything about the house, the room, the history, and how well kept the house is considering the house was built almost 100 years ago. cami and carol are both sisters and they are awesome, great hosts! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe queen anne room i stayed in has all the basic toiletries provided such as towels, shampoo, soap, hair dryer, etc. the shared kitchen has an old school walk-in fridge for you to store food and drinks. but they do provide coffee, tea and water. i must say the sisters have great taste as coffee are not your regular folgers from big box stores, they provided four barrel coffee from the mill and twinnings tea! there is also a computer and printer next to the kitchen in case you need to check or print something. they do have 2 cats, so if you have allergies this house is not for you but we were fine with pets. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall, i am looking forward to coming back when visiting sf!  oh my god, where do i start? it is the most beautiful house i ever had the pleasure of staying in. i travel a lot with work and have stayed in some very nice hotels, but this hands down beats them all. the house is huge, and decorated with amazing detail (you have access to the two dining rooms, lounge area, office space, kitchen, walk in fridge, laundry room and patio garden) . it\\'s like stepping into a period drama. i was almost upset that i won\\'t ever afford to live in a place like that. cami and carol are wonderful, incredibly friendly and gave us lots of advice for local stuff to see. they run the place incredibly well, with so much thought put into the little things. you can hear a some noise from the street (queen anne room), but it didn\\'t affect either of our ability to sleep and it\\'s mentioned in the listing, but don\\'t let that put you off please, you won\\'t regret booking here. the location is great too. there is a bus stop across the street which brings you straight into the centre, but i recommend using uber. they\\'re everywhere and cheap (max $7 into the centre). thank you so much guys we had a fantastic time with you!definitely one of my more memorable trips.  san francisco was full of beautiful people from all walks of life.  everyone from the moment we arrived was more than welcoming.  i loved that we had the best of both, on the first evening we got to meet the other guests and then i got to explore the wonderful city with my other half and that was the beauty of this experience.  meeting new people and sharing memories with my love :)the spencer house was unforgettable.  the house and wall-to-wall antique decor were in mint condition.   this was our first time using air b&b and the experience definitely left us wanting more!  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe queen anne room was perfect.  the conveniently designed shower and bathroom allowed for privacy.  the bay window breakfast nook had an excellent view.  the room was spacious for being one of the \"smaller\" rooms described and had plenty of storage for our 5 night stay.   \\r\\n\\r\\nthe shared space was large, clean and felt very comfortable.  we met some other bnbers and shared coffee and beer in the inviting living space.  the outdoor patio (equipped with heat lamps for colder nights) had a beautiful view and a lemon tree for the picking!  we were surprised with a parking space for our rental car as well. \\r\\n\\r\\ncami and carol were nothing short of excellent.  the refrigerator had shared items and was always stocked with water, juice, beer and snacks.  we had fresh towels daily.  they even installed a screen on our window and dropped lavender oil repellent after mentioning one mosquito!   we shared stories and discussed restaurants and things to do around the city.  i can\\'t say enough about our hosts. \\r\\n\\r\\ni can\\'t think of any downside except that we didn\\'t stay longer.  i will definitely try to book another room at the spencer house for my next san fran trip.  \\r\\nperfect location and perfect host!cami and carol were very professional, organised and extremely warm and welcoming.  i was one of the lucky one\\'s to also meet \\'mom\\' - who was lovely.  i arrived late and they waited for me even though they had plans that evening.  i\\'m sure they would have left the keys somewhere for me to find but my phone battery was dead so i could not make contact with them to give them an update on my progress from the airport which took two hours and the taxi driver was a maniac.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was a dream and i\\'m not the only one to notice that it\\'s a special place.  they shared the story of the house and it\\'s history and they really have purchased an amazing place.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat can i say about haight ashbury that hasn\\'t already been written - it\\'s a very famous place with a long history,  doesn\\'t come without it\\'s \\'problem\\'s but when i return to san francisco haight ashbury is where i will stay..  oh, and hopefully at spencer house in my room which was simply the best!!! :-)the house was amazing. the room was perfect. i am a bit of a house snob since i also live in a 1901 queen anne victorian. the house was restored/maintained to perfection. i spent many evenings just sitting in the dining room taking in the ambiance. cami was a delightful host, laid back and welcoming. she gave me lots of direction regarding local sushi restaurants. did not see any other guests until the evening of my departure. overall feel was that i was living in my own personal mansion in sf. highly recommended!the spencer house is a thrill. it\\'s a great location in a central part of town, close to so much. the hosts are communicative and friendly. and the house -- so interesting. like sleeping in a museum. hoping to come back with my wife and kids down the road because they need to experience this house.cami and carol were amazing hosts! the room was incredible and the house was an experience unto itself. my only regret was that i wish i could have spent more time in the house itself and with carol and cami. next time, i promise!as perfect, beautiful & warmly welcoming as ever!this is my second time staying in spencer house after my first visit a few years ago, and just like last time, i had a very enjoyable and comfortable stay.\\r\\n\\r\\ncami and carol as usual were great hosts, warm, super friendly and very responsive. i had arrived in san francisco early and they were able to accommodate me with an earlier check-in.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is straightforward to get to by public transport. i took the bart from sfo airport to the civic centre and then a no. 7 bus that stops right outside the house (you can also take the no. 6 bus.)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe immediate area is residential and quiet but within walking distance of lively areas such as haight-ashbury to the west and divisadero and castro streets to the east. there are a number of decent restaurants nearby with varying price ranges.\\r\\n\\r\\nadditionally, there is comic book store and also a games shop (board games and card games) nearby on divisadero street which was fortunate since i had hoped to pick up a few games while i was visiting the u.s. and it so happened that one of the few brick-and-mortar game shops in sf was close by.cami and carol were wonderful, as always! i booked this room for a visiting colleague and they were super helpful in preparing for his stay and very responsive. i would highly recommend them as hosts!if you look for local sf hosts with sunny, warm and energetic personalities, cami and carol are perfect. plus living in a historic, well preserved house that will make your stay more inspirational and full of imagination.   \\r\\n\\r\\nthe brazilian sisters have many lables: artist, photographer, interior designer, runner, chef and overall nice souls. i had breakfast with them at black sands and by the end of the meal, i already have 100+ more things to do in sf which made my sf local knowledge into shame. i can no longer call myself a travel & food writer after staying with cami & carol.  cami and i are both fans of hakata tonton, chinese dimsum, thai food etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nwalking on the street with cami + carol, you will run into artist who make beautiful watercolor sketches of neighborhood famous food destinations, or sushi chef who make camera from scratch. my mind was overflown with information. \\r\\n\\r\\ni cherish my friendship with cami and carol and i am thankful for the different side of sf that the sisters showed me.  the spencer house is like their baby and is well taken care of. this is one of a kind experience that cannot be replicated and will only enrich your life and horizon.i\\'m not sure i\\'ve had more welcoming hosts! cami and carol are both charming, wonderful and super friendly. the beauty and detailing of spencer house cannot be captured in photos - i felt like i noticed some thing new every time i walked around the property - overall a very cosy, welcoming atmosphere to relax and spend time.cami and carol were wonderful and very friendly; they showed me around the beautiful house and to my room, and were very accommodating throughout my stay. the home was beautiful and the room was very nice. there was some street noise, but the neighborhood was nice and quiet. not too far walking from a bunch of restaurants, also.it was a great location, very spacious. the coordinator made herself available and helped out by purchasing plastic utensils, paper plates, etc. overall, a great space that worked well for our needs! the loft was exactly what we were looking for -- spacious, clean, lived-in, with a warm and helpful welcome from matt\\'s friend queenie (she\\'s an angel). it was an ideal spot for our weekend plans: an intimate offsite, reunion of friends, and small party. would love to return!matt was an extremely gracious, patient, and accommodating host. he was beyond professional and highly organized, having a colleague contact us ahead of our stay to see if we needed any assistance prior to our arrival. he was in contact and available throughout the stay as well, and, in fact, a complete joy to just hang out with! the space itself is gorgeous. this was a business trip and all of our colleagues loved matt and the beautiful loft. stay here on your next trip, you will not be disappointed.matt\\'s loft was incredibly spacious and beautiful. it was very cozy as well and had plenty of space and sleeping quarters for our group. matt was super responsive and continually checked in to make sure we had what we needed. great location too, smack dab between the mission and lower haight. wouldn\\'t hesitate to come stay here again next time i\\'m in sf. thanks again matt!matt\\'s house was hipsterishly cool with oddments and art around the house, just the way i expected from his pictures. the neighorhood can be a little unpolished but once inside matt\\'s place, its a sanctuary with lots of space to explore and roam due to the myriad activities his house contains. despite not being physically there at his house on most days, matt was super helpful and responsive by phone or text. if you like a stay for a large group with a tinge of the chaotic flair that comes with artistic experimentation, take up matt\\'s place and you won\\'t be disappointed!our experience at matt\\'s loft was pure magic.  from matt - to his hosts and network - to the space itself - every aspect of our stay was  incredibly accommodating and thoughtful. \\r\\n\\r\\nmatt was very attentive and receptive to our needs and exceeded every expectation.  his friends and hosts were equally warm, genuine, quite brilliant and creative - a true pleasure to meet and connect with.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the loft itself, you will find comfort and inspiration hiding around every corner -  appreciate the original art, stream your music to sonos surround system, or taking a dual-head shower in a massive bathroom with a cool breeze flowing through the window - and enjoy the vibrant surroundings.  \\r\\n\\r\\npersonally i found myself continuously curious to explore and appreciate the subtle and considerate details - and was left constantly inspired. highly recommended.the loft was perfect for our wedding and a great place to stay while we were in san francisco with friends. matt and his housemates have made a very unique place in a great location. matt was responsive and the flat was beautiful. when we first got there, we had no idea how to get in. when we rang the bell, a woman who looked very annoyed opened the door and pretty much just walked away from us without guiding us where to go. it isn\\'t really well listed on how to get up to the loft, but we found our way. much to our surprise, there was a woman upstairs in the space using the microwave in the shared kitchen. the safehouse has a rule list that was sent to us at about 5pm the day before we were supposed to arrive, which seemed outdated. it talked about the shared space and communal showers - all things we were a little confused on because the listing said it was the entire apartment and that it was private. we also were unaware there would be people on the roof and sort of in and out as well. i rented the space for colleagues, so it was a little uncomfortable having to explain to them that it was a communal space (which is not really clearly listed on the site). the space was gorgeous and overall we had a fun time, but it just seemed to me that the whole idea is very gray area. what an amazing listing! huge space, with amazing furnishings. wonderful location in the mission. the host was very responsive and our trip was very successful. would highly recommend!what a place! the apartment was spacious and quirky and we had a fantastic time there. be wary it\\'s quite an open apartment, expect visitors!matt was super hospitable. very cool, laid back guy.what an interesting spot we landed in!  our family of ten enjoyed our visit in this unique space.  the beds were very comfortable and the high ceilings were enjoyed by all of our tall people!!!  the shower room is delightful.  we were welcomed by very friendly folk and the location seemed central to everything.  we were celebrating a family wedding and it was very special to have a space where everyone could just hang out and visit in our \"down-time\".  thank you!the loft is very spacious and very well decorated. my company used this for 4 colleagues while at a conference who thoroughly enjoyed their time here. thanks matt!\\r\\nelise  i\\'ve stayed at plenty of epic airbnbs and this is how this place stacks up: my group had 5. work colleagues whom i deem some of my closest friends. we wanted a community experience to live and bond. this place was a dream. the host matt was so accommodating and helpful. the space was so uniquely designed. the energy in the place really made the 6 nights we spent there a beautiful memory for life. vs all my other group airbnb experiences this is absolutely #1if youre looking for a unique and large accommodation in sf then matt\\'s eclectic abode should be perfect.\\n\\ncheck in was a breeze and communicating with matt feels like talking to a friend. \\n\\nthe loft is in an interesting neighborhood; auto body shops are your immediate neighbors but only short walks away are great coffee (four barrels), thai and italian restaurants.\\n\\ninside, the loft has a distinctly hippie flair which is enhanced by the carved wood furniture, art pieces and various  other intricacies. beds are comfortable and bathrooms fully equipped and clean.  \\n\\nthe roof top patio continues the eclectic theme with awesome hang out areas, including a basket from a hot air balloon.  a lot of fun can be had in this patio, and knowing matt, it surely has.\\n\\nin sum, the loft is but a microcosm of sf: both the city and the loft weave business into a laid back lifestyle; matt is both young and professional; and the neighborhood is both raw and welcoming.  honestly, a perfect place for a group of 3 to 7 people who want a real airbnb experience.matt was an amazing host. the space was amazing. i would definitely come back again. this place is beautiful. matt had great communication and was very friendly. would 100% come back again!matt is an amazing host, he\\'s very responsive and does its best to make sure we have everything we need. he\\'s also really passionate about his space which has been lovingly designed. \\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s not for everyone but perfect for groups wanting to spend time in a fun, laid back house in a great location.adriana is great - she even offered to come pick me up from the airport and checked in to make sure all was well.\\r\\n\\r\\nlocation is cool, easy enough to get to downtown on 3rd and portrero / dogpatch v accessible.the room was clean, comfortable and simple.  plenty of room for two adults to sleep and clean and shower without any disturbances whatsoever.  the room is part of a larger living space was was peaceful and tastefully decorated, very clean and very quiet.  we met one of the roommates on our way in and out one evening and he was perfectly pleasant and introduced himself, but we all congenially absorbed back into our own little spheres very easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nadriana was very hospitable, kind and responsive by text.  parking was a breeze on the weekend (the multitude of signs refer mostly to daylight hours during the weekdays).  the area *looks* a little rough at first glance, but in truth, it\\'s just industrial and very safe and quiet.  the condo complex where you stay is obviously a newer addition to the neighborhood, with all the shiny, trendy fronts and modern design that you expect from a new building.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, very satisfied with the space, the host, and its proximity to our destinations in potrero hill.the reservation was canceled 14 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.adriana\\'s room was spacious with a large bed, led cinema display to connect a laptop to watch movies, etc, private balcony and private bathroom, shower and toilet. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe room is well located in the dogpatch with the muni t line to downtown san francisco a very short walk. there are also a lot of good restaurants in the surrounding area and nearby potrero hill and mission district.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend staying here :)this place is an absolute gem! impeccably decorated with attention to every last detail, this cosy, quiet, spacious property makes you feel ever-so-comfortable. aside from the amazing decor, quality, fancy finishes, furniture and fittings, and all of the creature comforts this home boasts, perhaps the best part is the amazing shower, which delivers the most refreshing way to relax at the end of the day. \\r\\nthe host\\'s attention to detail is not lost on the household manual - a veritable bible of the home, and the funky, interesting neighbourhood in which it stands. \\r\\nthe mission is quiet enough, yet still brimming with cool bars and the house is within walking distance to public transport. but you\\'ll learn all of this for yourself from reading the manual. \\r\\ncharles even left a bottle of australian wine for us to enjoy, which, given we are from australia, we thought was a very kind and thoughtful touch. \\r\\nperhaps the most delightful place we ever did stay. \\r\\ni cannot recommend it highly enough!     great stay, very thoughtful hosts. couldn\\'t ask for anything better.charles\\'s apartment is exactly as described - an oasis in the mission. beautifully renovated with a touch of humor, it\\'s a lovely place to stay when visiting sf. charles is a great host - responsive and super easy to work with. he really goes out of his way to make sure you have a pleasant stay. thumbs up! charles and rene are perfect hosts. we had a pleasant stay at the apartment. the oasis is as beautiful as described. thanks for everything.such a beautiful, quirky, and efficient home!  attention to detail was not spared. from the incredible coffee machine, to the water fall shower, and the cozy, comfy bed it was better than home!   charles and rene were wonderful hosts that ensured we had everything we needed to visit san francisco as a local! i highly recommend their chic and interesting home that matches the unique atmosphere of sf.this apartment is a dream -- incredibly comfortable, well appointed, and thoughtfully designed. we enjoyed our stay and rene and charles were exceptional hosts. the apartment has every creature comfort at hand and comes with very clear details about where to find/ operate things. and don\\'t let the second pull-out bed give you pause, it\\'s wonderful. we highly recommend this gem and look forward to returning soon. charles and rene\\'s apartment was above and beyond what i had expected! it was very clean and comfortable and served as a perfect home base to explore the city. the apartment is located within just a couple blocks of amazing shopping, tea, coffee, and restaurants. i would highly recommend staying it this apartment, it is so beautiful!this place was absolutely lovely. i rented it for my aunts to stay for a long weekend and they loved it.  the hosts are incredibly organized and the house is immaculate.we had a great time in san francisco, rene\\'s place is located near restaurants and public transportation, he was very helpful during our stay, prompt to answer any questions we had. the house is beautiful and comfortable, a true home away from home.  we recommend it to anyone traveling to the area. we absolutely loved staying in this gorgeous home! the amenities were fantastic, and the beds super comfy. charles & rene are amazing hosts, cannot recommend this home enough.our time spent at charles and rené\\'s was very comfortable. they provided ample information about the apartment and neighbourhood and so we felt very welcomed and informed :) \\r\\n\\r\\nall the amenities were as described in the listing - both beds were extremely comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend this to any work colleagues when they are travelling to sf.we absolutely loved our stay in san francisco - charles and rene were the perfect hosts and made us feel so welcome. not only did they have a great guide highlighting the best restaurants and bars in the area, they were also on hand in case we had other questions that needed answering. their home is absolutely beautiful and we were so sad when we had to leave. mission is a great area with loads to do - we will definitely be coming back to charles and rene\\'s if we ever visit san francisco again! xcharles & rené\\'s apartment was a perfect home base for our trip to san francisco!  located in the mission district, which is a neighborhood in transition, and around the corner from the 16th & mission bart station, with easy access to highways, we thought the location was very convenient.  there are lots of cute new restaurants, bars, boutiques and coffee shops in the area (including the famed bakery, tartine, about a 10 min walk away), but as you\\'ll unfortunately find in any big city, there are also a number of homeless people in the area, which previous reviewers mention made them uncomfortable -- living in dc, this wasn\\'t unusual or a problem for us -- and we never really felt unsafe walking around at night.  bonus points for access to the garage, and the ease of accessing it with a mobile app, but as described it is a very tight squeeze (we had a honda accord).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment itself is beautiful and all of the pictures (and descriptions) are completely accurate.  charles & rené happened to be in town the weekend we stayed at their place, so they met us at the apartment to give us a tour and make sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  even if they hadn\\'t been in town, the \"apartment handbook\" they left has pictures and instructions for everything in the apartment.  they\\'re both very friendly and accommodating -- rené even made us the most delicious blueberry muffins as a welcome gift!  you\\'ll have access to a full kitchen and some snacks (fruit, cereal, etc.) that charles & rené made available.  we didn\\'t try out the coffee maker, so i can\\'t comment on that.  both beds are really comfortable, though as described, the front room is definitely nosier than the back bedroom (typical city street sounds), but charles & rené provide ear plugs if you\\'re a light sleeper.   really nice shower and charles & rené provided an abundance of towels for our stay over the weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, we had a great time at charles & rené\\'s place and would not hesitate to stay here again if we\\'re ever back in sf!\\r\\n\\r\\nrene & charles are very gracious hosts who have put together a truly outstanding apartment. it is immaculately kept and the beds are very comfortable. i found a really nice restaurant within walking distance called sauces, and most other places are just a short cab or uber ride away. it is also convenient to bart if you want to avoid the need for a car. definitely would recommend this home to anyone traveling into the metro sf area.\\nrene and charles are great hosts. a great accommodation to explore san francisco!\\nwithin walking distance from valencia street. go here in the evening to visit one of the bars.\\ndo not forget to visit also alcatraz, golden gate bridge, six painted ladies, lombard st., twin peaks, a game of the giants and pier 39. \\neasy to get everywhere we recommend to use uber. affordable and within minutes an uber available.\\nyou can park your car in their garage. unless you have a chevy surburban ... this does not fit through the door ;) the car can be parked on the street. but read the signs correctly.\\nare you going to san francisco. then this is the place to be! \\nwe enjoyed your hospitality.\\njordy, aafke, marco and darcy\\ncharles and rené are top notch hosts and their place is fantastic! we used the space for an event and they couldn\\'t have been better hosts. they even baked brownies and muffins for us, left fruits and other snacks. highly recommended! :)the owners of this great house are very well-organized and provided a hearty welcome. they made us feel very welcome and at home away from home. \\r\\n charles and rene couldn\\'t have been better hosts. they went above and beyond to make our experience enjoyable.  their home is spectacular in every way.   their photos and descriptions are modest at best.  i highly recommend you book this home.  we didn\\'t want to leave!we enjoyed an amazing week at rene and charles\\' home in the mission!  \\r\\ntheir home is beautiful and the pictures do not fully do justice to the amazing uniqueness of their style and design.\\r\\nwe appreciated their hospitality and going above and beyond in making our stay pleasant.  the house manual was very useful and provided us with great ideas to tour the many beautiful neighbourhoods and hot spots nearby.\\r\\nthanks again for making our time in california so enjoyable and offering us all the comforts of home.  lennalu was a great host and i appreciated her attention to detail in making my stay as nice as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.this was my first time staying at an airbnb and it was an excellent experience! lenna and her two dogs are incredibly friendly and awesome. she\\'ll go out of her way to make you feel comfortable. her place is great! not only is it well kept and clean, but it\\'s also nicely decorated. i will most definitely stay with her again the next time i go back to san francisco.lenna’s place has a relaxed, comfortable vibe.\\r\\n\\r\\nlenna, coco and xena are friendly while being respectful of the guest’s space and wishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nlenna is very helpful with local navigation and suggestions of nearby restaurants. i believe she would go out of her way to try to accommodate a guest.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is particularly convenient for pedestrian exploration of soma and/or visiting the ballpark.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was feeling like a sf resident after two days.\\r\\nhad a great time at lenna\\'s place, she always had great recommendations for us for things to do and places to eat around san francisco. great space, nicely locatedandrea\\'s place is amazing!! the house is beautiful and the location is ideal. we very much enjoyed our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\ncommunicating with andrea was very easy. she went above and beyond to coordinate our stay supplying parking information and other local details. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely recommend her place to a friend or stay for a future visit. i can only say great things about my experience with andrea and her home.  not only is andrea very attentive and responsive, but the house is just great.  the location is very convenient to several great neighborhoods, and good restaurants are within walking distance.  i\\'d recommend this house for small groups and families.  the deck is great for a cup of coffee in the morning, and surrounded by gorgeous trees and plants.  for those who need access to the muni (the subway), it\\'s only two blocks away! all in all, a great experience. andrea is a gracious host. while we didn\\'t meet her in person, she was extremely responsive, helpful and available. andrea provides helpful information in a welcome letter and is readily available for any questions. her recommandations for restaurants, cafes etc. were great.\\nandrea\\' s home was everything we hoped it would be and even more. it is as shown in the pictures, comfortably and lovingly furnished, clean and roomy.\\nit was a perfect home for wonderful days in san francisco. we would definitely recommend this place to friends and look forward to visit again in future.walking into the robb\\'s family home is like walking into your family or best friends home. it\\'s cozy, intimate, \\nsurprisingly comfortable and well equipped. andrea has great attention to detail. \\nevery single thing i looked for was there in it\\'s place.\\neven though they were not in the country, there was constant communication with andrea even through our earthquake experience!!!\\ngreat recommendations for restaurants.\\nlots of bedrooms, i specially liked the master with the outdoor terrace.\\nit is very centrally located, you can walk to restaurants/shops. \\nparking during the week can be a bit challenging but we found it, no problem on weekend.\\nthe house is basically three stories so it does have lots of stairs, may be difficult for older persons with large suitcases. \\ni would recommend it highly to anyone considering a place in san fran!\\n\\n\\ngreat communication, lots of info and felt like a lot of care was applied to all guest, location was awesome- close to fab cafes and public transport. made the stay very enjoyable. coffee at soleil cafe was unbeatable. this was my first experience with airbnb and it couldn\\'t have been better!  andrea was so responsive and reassuring with all my questions and concerns.  she made us feel very welcome and comfortable in her home.  the house is bright and beautiful and the neighborhood was perfect for my family.  it\\'s quiet and peaceful with lots of greenery and very minimal traffic.  my family really enjoyed staying there and i really appreciated andrea\\'s attention to detail and hospitality.andrea\\'s home is beautiful, just as described, and she is an absolutely fantastic host.  leading up to our reservation and all throughout our stay, she was incredibly thoughtful and responsive - even going so far as to leave us a welcome bag of goodies when we arrived.  thank you so much for a wonderful stay, andrea!  incredible sf location, very beautiful, charming and spacious home in lower haight.  andrea was an incredibly responsive host and provided a binder with tons of great/useful info on the house and neighborhood. i will definitely stay here in the future. amazing place, amazing host! emilie was very nice from the very beginning, very patience and flexible with my schedule. when i arrived, she was there with a wide-californian smile :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is excellent, met my expectation 100%. the description is honest and accurate.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighbourhood is perfect, really peaceful but from a walking distance of so many things. i loved it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni hope i can go back to emilie\\'s house in my future visits to sf.this is a wonderful place to stay and emilie went out of her way to make us comfortable at the house and get the most out of our visit. the house is spacious with comfortable and quiet bedrooms, a nicely appointed kitchen, and a sunny dining room that opens to the rear patio. we were in town for a wedding and it was a welcome refuge as we were running about town. located near duboce park and the lower haight, it is also super convenient to the surrounding neighborhoods as well as public transportation. i would definitely stay here again and recommend it without hesitation. thank you so much emilie for sharing your home and being such a wonderful host!melissa\\'s apartment was fantastic. it\\'s clean, bright and welcoming. nice living room with a couch and chairs, and a dining room. really nice and big kitchen with seating for a few people. it\\'s on a quiet street on the hill up towards bernal heights. great for a morning walk. nearby there are a few cafes and within walking distance is the mission neighborhood with the cities best restaurants, taquerias and bustling night life. the small backyard is fantastic (and something that is rare in sf). there is a seating area, a fireplace, and lounge chairs. melissa was great and welcoming. i locked myself out late evening and had to get her help (sorry melissa) which she helped me out with with a smile. it was great for sharing with a colleague (like i did), but would also be brilliant for a family or two couples. only the best recommendations from me!we really enjoyed our stay here. melissa was a great host. she was very accommodating, providing us with things that were not included in the house such as iron, board, hairdryer. we love the location of the property as it is not too far from the city but yet where we were able to enjoy some peace and quiet time. and then the view! as the property is on a slope so you get a absolutely breathtaking view of the city especially at night. there was a little garden in the back where you can sit and relax and just soak in the beautiful san francisco. on top of that, melissa also gave us a reserved parking space right in front of the house so we don\\'t have to deal with finding a parking every day. if we were to return to san francisco again, this is hands down the place i would like to stay again. thank you for everything melissa!my family of four plus dogs spent a few nights in this beautiful house. we were constantly drawn to the gorgeous views from the front windows as well as from the backyard. the property\\'s pictures do not represent how spacious and enjoyable the backyard is! we also had a great walk with our dogs to the hill that rises half a block from the house. dog heaven and more exhilarating views!\\n\\nthe house was stocked well with basics and the beds were comfortable. \\n\\nthe neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. two blocks down the hill was a handy small market and nearby precita park had a playground for kids and a nice cafe for breakfast or lunch. the block the house is on is extremely steep. my mother-in-law\\'s balance is not great and she found the terrain difficult to traverse - even from the car to the front door. but she didnt regret having those views, all the same!\\n\\nwe thought this was a great house to enjoy a particularly nice neighborhood of san francisco. \\nwe felt entirely welcome. melissa  was terrific: she greeted us and showed us \"the ropes\" . it is a lovely and comfortable property in a great neighborhood with spectacular views of downtown san francisco,  super  (close) proximity to the bernal heights and precita parks, great cafes and restaurants, and easy access to the entire city.melissa was fantastic. she greeted us, showed off the place and let us enjoy the space right away. everything was organized and clean and the view is fantastic.the house and its hostess did not disappoint. the apartment is exquisitely decorated, impeccably clean and complete with all one needs for a short stay. the hostess was also very responsive to our inquiries. the house is a short walk to a park with beautiful views. bernal heights has cute shops and small restaurants. overall, we loved our experience! melissa\\'s house in bernal heights was the perfect accommodation for myself and colleagues during our recent two day business trip to sf. the house is very well appointed with an amazing view of the city and harbour, we especially appreciated the quality of towels, linens, kitchen amenities, and furniture ...made us feel like we were staying in a boutique hotel. i highly recommend this airbnb for business travel, and group getaways! melissa\\'s place was perfect for our party of 5, with breathtaking views of san francisco right out the door (coupled with a literally breathtaking hike up the hill!), superbly equipped kitchen and a nice backyard barbeque.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is as quiet and idyllic as it gets, with charming cafes and the top of bernal heights right next door for morning jogs or just enjoying the views. it\\'s also right next to mission and noe valley, which both are fantastic neighborhoods in addition to bernal heights for eating, drinking and enjoying life.\\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa was very accommodating and quick to respond to any inquiries, making sure we felt welcome! i warmly recommend staying here.melissa is an excellent hostess. the house is charming and very clean and fresh, almost hotel-like with white linens and towels and no personal clutter. it  was well stocked with paper goods and coffee for the kuerig. there is a very effective electric fireplace in the living room for cutting the morning chill. the house is located on a steep hill and the street dead ends into bernal heights park, which has many trails and vistas looking out over the city. it is very popular with local dog owners. the view from the front windows is spectacular. the neighborhood is quiet and charming, with older homes, steep hills and staircases between the houses to help you descend to the flatlands. you can easily walk to the mission district and a nice shopping area on cortland st. is just on the other side of the bernal heights park. there\\'s also precita park, a big grassy swath with a children\\'s playground, just a few blocks away. there is a nice bodega, a supper club and a cafe all with excellent food within a few blocks of the house. we have lived in the bay area all our lives and go to sf frequently but always to a museum, ball game, restaurant or some other destination and then go home. our goal for this trip was to enjoy the city at a leisurely pace, strolling the neighborhoods and eating at all the new restaurants. this place fit the bill perfectly. we parked our car when we got there and didn\\'t use it once--used lyft and muni to go everywhere. no parking or traffic hassles. we had such a wonderful experience we are thinking of making our sf \"staycation\" an annual event.melissa is an awesome host, she was quick and responsive in both email and text. the house is very clean, nice, cosy with an amazing view. we had everything we needed - bed, good bathroom, etc. coffee was great :)  location is very quiet and safe.\\r\\ngreat experience.  would recommend again!\\r\\nwe arrived to welcome cookies and out very own cozy bernal heights home.  so close to the park, this is a fabulous option for families.  we climbed bernal hill, shopped and dined in the local neighborhood and felt like real bay area residents!first time using airb&b and the experience was fantastic. everything that was described was super accurate. melissa made us feel welcomed and was attentive to all of our needs. truly a wonderful experience. thank you melissa, we will definitely stay again if we are ever in san fran. very beautiful house, with an incredible view on the downtown and bay.\\nquiet place, with all as espected.\\nthanks mélissa for this great vacation.melissa was a fantastic host and her place is amazing.  we spent a few days there with our two small children and nobody wanted to leave.  bernal hill is just steps away and made for some great morning hikes with the kids, and the views from the front rooms and the backyard are incredible.  the kitchen is big and well stocked with anything you need to cook, and the rooms are comfortable with plenty of space.  melissa was waiting for us when we arrived and made us feel welcome throughout the trip.  she was helpful and kind and a great host.  melissa\\'s cute townhouse was the perfect place for our little group to stay for a few nights while visiting friends in san fran. the place was spacious, clean, and has a great view of the city at night from the back yard. it\\'s in a good location too - a nice, quiet little neighbourhood, but only a short walk over to the mission and valencia. we enjoyed brunch at the precita park cafe, just around the corner - thanks for the recommendation, melissa. i\\'d definitely recommend your place to anyone.melissa was a very nice person.she house was beautiful cozy and clean. house got everything u need.we really appreciate melissa\\'s kindly hospitalitywe all loved staying at melissa\\'s home.  we were very comfortable in the two large double rooms and one twin, crisp white sheets and fluffy towels.  the kitchen was well equipped and we were left coffee and cookies, which was a lovely touch. the shower was good, and everything was spotlessly clean.  melissa was on holiday when we stayed but her friend alicia, was on hand to help with all our requirements. the wifi had to be reset once while we were there, which was dealt with quickly and otherwise worked very well.  the neighborhood is residential, very quiet and feels safe, lots of families.  its on a very steep hill which adds to the excitement of staying in a real san francisco neighborhood and the views of the city are amazing day and night. there\\'s a great deli with great selection for all meals wines/beers/ales and a couple of cafes for breakfast near precita park within walking distance. although you would have to be able bodied to tackle the hill, which was great fun for as.  the district was near mission which my partner walked in 17 mins but i caught an uber for less than $10.    i would definitely recommend staying here and would definitely return.  it was awesome staying at melissa\\'s place! it was exactly as advertised, offered cool views of san francisco, and is only a ~10 bucks uber drive from all the attractions. melissa made all the possible effort to make our stay as comfortable as possible. i definitely recommend place!great location and views. comfortable beds and nice large kitchen. loved it. i rented melissa\\'s beautiful place for my wedding weekend, and it was perfect -  cute and comfortable for give girls to stay in, hangout and share meals together for several days, but best of all, the lighting and decor made for amazing getting-ready photos. melissa was also the most accommodating host, welcoming us with fresh baked cookies and flowers, providing us with additional mirrors, offering us to use the shared backyard firepit area and marshmallows, and just checking in once in awhile. i highly recommend this place to anyone!first time using airbnb and the experience was fantastic.  melissa was a fantastic host and her place is amazing!! it was exactly as advertised and offered cool views of san francisco.  we were in san francisco for a short family weekend getway.  5 adults and her her place still was spacious.  we were very comfortable in the two large double rooms and one twin, the kitchen was well equipped and there were coffee and cookies when arrived.  the shower was good, and everything was spotlessly clean. i would definitely recommend staying here and would definitely return.the neighborhood is perfect for san francisco experience. the view from the living room is extraordinary. everything looks exactly like what you see in the post.melissa has a gorgeous house tucked in a very nice, quiet neighborhood! she was a wonderful host and was happy to help provide suggestions for local restaurants and things to do. \\n\\nthere was plenty of space for all 6 of us to hang out and sleep comfortably and we highly recommend staying here! we had a wonderful time at the house! plenty of space for all of us and the view was incredible. appreciated having a parking spot because we did end up needing it. the neighborhood was so quiet and the location was great from our perspective! melissa was a great host and was there to answer all of the questions we had. it was perfect! our experience was great, especially as this was our first airbnb booking and we weren\\'t sure what to expect.  the home was well stocked, cookies and coffee was a great surprise that we enjoyed.  all in all i don\\'t think there is really anything i would have changed.when you think categories, they say that every neighborhood has a hidden gem. for airbnb in san francisco, you should look no further, this is it! you\\'re provided a room that not only feels like a luxury hotel room (includes just about everything in one too) but the experience is further enhanced with a touch of wonderful company. tim, his wife, and their two shiba inus were a delight, showed me a bit of the city and provided a \\'welcome home\\' vibe that you normally wouldn\\'t get from staying at a random person\\'s place. immediately, i was presented with a welcome packet that goes over questions one would have about the place, history of the neighborhood, details about the amenities, and their sf recommendations! both the bedroom and the bathroom included the extras that people appreciate when packing light such as soap, shampoo, towels, etc. of course, you\\'re also given access to a huge hdtv that has comcast with most premium movie channels. it\\'s easy to say that they\\'ve definitely thought thru making my stay (or anyone else\\'s for that matter) in their beautiful home - a good one.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor those wondering about the area - it\\'s very quiet, safe, and centrally located to sf\\'s top tourist attractions such as the presidio, the painted ladies, golden gate park, and much more. i recommend checking out fillmore street (tons of restaurants there) and japan center which are just a few blocks away!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe dogs? oh, don\\'t worry about the dogs. they\\'re extremely friendly (not in the annoying way) and surprisingly quiet unlike most dogs when new visitors arrive. they don\\'t bite, lick, or growl. a friendly smile and a hello will do for them but give \\'em so love, if you can. why wouldn\\'t you?\\r\\n\\r\\nif you\\'re looking for a quiet, relaxing, and top class airbnb experience then i highly recommend booking with tim.tim\\'s place was fantastic and he was a very gracious host. beautiful room, gorgeous bathroom, fabulous location. tim and his wife even gave me slippers and a guide to the area with information about transportation, food, and more. and the dogs are adorable! if you have a chance to stay here, do! tim and his wife were awesome hosts with a breathtaking house. parking was free during the night but was limited to 2 hours during the day, which was annoying at times but i\\'d recommend not having a car in the city. the house is located in the center of the city and my friend and i had no problems walking around town from tim\\'s. they also have 2 extremely nice dogs which never bothered us. tim and his wife stay out of your way so it feels like you\\'re living in the city in a private spot which is fantastic.my husband and i loved our stayed with tim and young mi.  they were extremely generous hosts and our accommodations were gorgeous and spotless!  i felt like i was sleeping in an interior design magazine.  the bed is warm and comfortable and the house is very quite.  it\\'s only a few blocks from filmore street, so quick access to great shops and restaurants. \\r\\ntim and young mi were very warm and welcoming and their little fox dogs are precious. we really enjoyed their company! i highly recommend staying here.  it\\'s like a 5 star inn and the price can not be beat.  i will be back!great stay with tim and young mi in the gorgeous house in san fran!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts were very responsive and the accommodations are exactly as they appear.. gorgeous! great location within walking distance to many restaurants and shops. the hosts were helpful and let us have our privacy, would recommend!fantastic! we loved our stay in lower pacific heights. perfect location when visiting san fran being so close to everything and such a nice area. everything you need within a short walk and an easy bus ride or nice walk into town. \\nbeautiful house and bedroom for accommodation, better than a 5 star hotel room. \\nthe hosts were the nicest people and so respectful. you cant go wrong staying here!! it is such an amazing house and accommodation. i had a terrific experience with my san francisco visit and my stay with tim and young mi in their beautiful and comfortable home. this was my first airbnb experience and quite honestly, i was a bit unsure as to what to expect. the accommodations were exactly as they appear in the photos and as described in their information. the location was very convenient and in close proximity to area restaurants and shops. tim and young mi were friendly and engaging - they were a lot of fun to speak with in the limited time that we were able to chat. and their two small dogs were great too! all in all, a great visit! highly recommended!the apartment exceeded our expectations.  it was in a charming location, beautifully remodeled home / bedroom with a amazing private bathroom.  tim and young mi were very friendly and made us feel welcomed.  i would definitely recommend staying with them during your next trip to sf!  tim\\'s and young mi\\'s house is a true state of the art airbnb stay for all san francisco visitors. absolutely warm and welcoming people that love sharing their passion towards their beautiful victorian home. this was definitely our best airbnb stay so far. large bedroom with the private bathroom wrapped in a luxury marble finish makes you feel like in a 5 star hotel. extremely organized, clean, and beautifully decorated space! we definitely recommend it to every guest visiting san fran.  my stay at the lower pac heights victorian was perfect.  tim was incredibly easy to work with.  the room and bath were as lovely as described and extremely comfortable.  the neighborhood was really fun - great shopping and dining.  i highly recommend.   my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay at tim and young mi\\'s beautiful home.  the room was as described in the ad and very comfortable.  tim and young mi were very helpful with suggestions and very pleasant when our paths crossed.  the neighbourhood is clean, safe, central and has many shops and restaurants minutes away.  my wife loved the dogs and b patisserie around the corner. we loved it and will be back! \\n\\ni highly

숙소만이 아니라 좋은 친구를 만나고 온 거 같은 기분입니다 :)tim and young mi were amazing.  the description was exactly right and we felt welcomed right from the beginning.  this place had all the comforts of home (even trixie and tags made us feel at home) and we enjoyed being able to chat with both of them.  they were able to give us some good pointers and gave us a hand when we needed it. we made good use of the dining room for our breakfast and late night meals.  the location was great.  very safe and so convenient to grab the muni.  we explored the city and thoroughly enjoyed it.  hopefully we will be able to come back and stay with tim and young mi next time here or somewhere else....\\r\\na & jtim is a fantastic host.  the room and bathroom are gorgeous.  the location is great - a few blocks from the many great restaurants and shops on filmore.  a perfect  stay in san francisco!this was our first airbnb experience and a great first start!  it actually may have raised our standards too high for future trips since this house was so awesome.  centrally located in sf, everything was within walking distance and the neighborhood of the house was very safe, which is the utmost importance.  rooms look exactly like it does in the pictures, very well furnished and clean.  bed and pillows were super comfortable and great shower/pressure, along with little knickknacks you find behind the bathroom cabinet in case you forget to pack something like shampoo/soap/bandaids/etc...\\r\\n\\r\\nthis house was a gem.  we felt very comfortable staying here and the private bathroom was a plus, since most of the other places do not offer this.  hosts were wonderful as well, including their cute little shiba inus that we adored!  tim and miyoung were very accommodating, especially with our check-in/out times since they did not have other visitors during our dates and they provide well guided informations about sf sites/restaurants/events/etc...  very informative, so you should check out their guide book.\\r\\n\\r\\ndefinitely recommend-worthy place to my friends and would book again for our future sf trips.  thank you for providing us a wonderful stay!\\r\\n\\r\\n     tim and young mi were amazing hosts. they were very kind, accommodating, and made me feel right at home. they provided lots of helpful information about the area. \\n\\ntim and young mi\\'s home is exactly as described - bright, stylish, warm, and located in san francisco\\'s best suburb. this is a great place to stay, large room, comfortable bed and brilliant bathroom.  superbly renovated heritage home.  shops and restaurants just down the road -- 5 mins walk away and with every kind of food available.  close to the city using the no 1 bus which comes every 5 - 10 mins.  or go as far as van ness rd and switch to the cable car -- no queues this way.  the host are helpful and very accommodating.  thank you tim and youngme for wonderful holiday accommodation.tim\\'s and young mi\\'s apartment is located in the pacific heights, one of the best areas of sf, safe and gentrified. there are a lot of shops, boutiques, nice bars and cafés around.\\n\\nthe apartment is designed and decorated by young mi and tim. young mi has an exquisite taste for fashion and comfort. her choice of fabrics, furniture, all the decor is just fabulous. all the pieces come from different design epochs and styles but they perfectly match each other and altogether make the apartment have it\\'s own unique face.\\n\\nthe bed is comfortable, the air is fresh, the linen - like at home. and the bathroom deserves a special compliment. it\\'s comfortable, nicely decorated and you don\\'t want to get out.\\n\\nthe couple also has a huge library with the books on fashion, politics, media, art etc. library and the living room are perfect places to have a morning coffee.\\n\\nyoung mi and tim are great hosts. they provide you with all the necessary supplies and make useful advice what to do in which part of the city. \\nthey have a special list of places to advice)\\n\\nand... tag and trixie - two amazing dogs living with them. you can\\'t stop caring them. lovely, friendly and just ones you always dreamed to have but was were afraid to) so we actually became dog lovers after staying with tag and trixie.\\n\\nspecial thanks go to young mi\\'s choice of toiletries. as a great traveler she collected special samples from the well known brands such as le labo and espa so you would feel yourself in a comfy hotels bathroom. \\n\\nwe loved staying with young mi and tim and would highly recommend it to everyone.   \\n\\n\\nthe apartment was superb, as was the location. and we couldn\\'t asked for better hosts! since it was me and my wife\\'s honeymoon, they even surprised us with a bottle of wine and a congrats card! how sweet is that?! and to top it off, tim even drove us to the airport when it was time to head for new york. that\\'s beyond hospitality! the room was really nice and cosy. a big screen with lots of channels, a comfy bed and a luxurious private bathroom added to the experience. and the location can\\'t be much better. situated in the quiet pacific heights area with walking distance to pretty much anything. we highly recommend this little airbnb treasure! what can i say? the room was absolutely beautiful.  you can tell tim & young mi put a lot of time and thought into giving their guests a great airbnb experience.  the only difference between this room and a class hotel room was that this room provided full instructions to the facilities, tips and guides for the neighbourhood, maps, books etc.\\r\\n\\r\\ntim & young mi were very welcoming and it is very obvious that they are world travellers, and want to give their guests the experience that they would expect when they travel.  they were lovely, as were there two dogs.the entire stay was wonderful.  tim is extraordinarily knowledgeable about the area and willing to help out whenever needed.  the room and house are very smartly decorated and in perfect shape with just about any amenity you\\'d need already thought through and provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nboth hosts were extremely friendly but gave us plenty of space to ourselves.  the front of the house is pretty much all for the guests with minimal overlap with the hosts unless desired...which we did given their fun attitude and two adorable dogs.  both dogs were in as great a shape as the home and as equally non-intrusive but also friendly as the hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\nin short, stay was great, and definitely recommend the place.  will be looking them up next time we\\'re in san francisco.we stayed with tim for 3 nights and it was wonderful.  the location is close to the bus stop for heading downtown, and near to great shopping and restaurants.  it is obvious that a lot of thought went into making the guest room comfortable for visitors.  there is a large-screen tv, private bath, and access to a dining room across the hall complete with coffee maker, small refrigerator and microwave.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely stay here again!  i stayed here for 2 weeks and tim and young mi were great hosts. the room was very comfortable, beautifully decorated and in a great location. close to many great restaurants and shops. perfect if you are in the medical field as the mt. zion campus is close.  would definitely stay again. tim and his wife are gems ,the house is amazing and clean you have everything you need.he even took me to the airport because he had time! i spend a lot of time walking the area and fillmore street. \\r\\nmy stay was simply devine and i would go back when sf calls again!\\r\\noh and the dogs are sweet quiet and friendly\\r\\ntim and young mi’s accommodations are splendid, and they are wonderful hosts.  the apartment is beautifully decorated, with stylish yet comfortable furnishings.   the hosts have anticipated all your needs.   the dogs, tag and trixie, are a part of the experience but they are not a problem at all.  all 4 “hosts” give the guests space to relax without too much contact, yet they are there for you if you’d like to connect.  you’ll like staying here.   we highly recommend it.  i left my heart at tim & young mi\\'s enchanted home!!! a perfect san francisco experience!!! the hosts are amazing in every way, the location can\\'t be beat (you can walk everywhere!), and the charm of this exquisite victorian is breathtaking. i can\\'t recommend this place highly enough & i will stay here again during my next sf trip. very beautiful people and nice house. thank youi atayed with tim and young mi for five days and they\\'re wonderful hosts. their house is beautiful and immaculate: a perfect mix of charm and contemporary amenities. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe pacific heights neighborhood is one of san francisco\\'s best; quiet, attractive and well-located.\\r\\n\\r\\ni felt like i was staying in a cozy, private hotel.tim, his wife, and their adorable dogs make the best hosts ever!  i love staying at their place - feels like a second home away from home whenever i have to travel to the area.  thanks for always making me feel so welcome.  the attention to detail and what they have done with the space is impeccable.  and boy, do i love those heated bathroom tile floors...truly luxe and terrific location on top of all of the other wonderful amenities.the best hosts i\\'ve ever had. honestly, tim and young mi are incredible people. i\\'ve never felt more at home. i hope every airbnb i stay in takes after the experience i had in their home. beautiful room and house, they showed me around the amazing neighborhood and i befriended their loving dog trixy (spelling?). i look forward to visiting sf again, and hope to stay with my new friends. young mi greeted me at the door of a lovely victorian house on an extremely quiet street and tim was waiting inside with the two dogs.   after showing me the fairmont-quality bed and bathroom (never underestimate the value of a good hot shower after a long day in san francisco), the coffee-maker, frig and dining table, we had a nice chat and then they left me to my travels.  i spent four nights, had no noisy interruptions from outside or in, and never once thought \"i wish there was...\" or \"i\\'d rather be at a hotel...\"   fabulous.   thank  you. young mi and tim have a lovely place in pacific heights and i thoroughly enjoyed staying with them - they were friendly and welcoming (as were the dogs!), and the bedroom + bathroom were spacious, clean and well kept. i also appreciated how young mi and tim provided lots of thoughtful extras like hair dryer, robe, coffee maker, etc. - i much preferred it to staying at a hotel. i highly recommend their place for anyone looking to stay in one of the most charming neighborhoods in san francisco; i will definitely be staying with them again!tim and young mi is so kindness!!!\\ntag and trixie are so lovely dogs.\\ni spend a so nice time in san francisco.\\nthe house is near to many place in sf.\\ni want to stay his house again so much.\\nanother good stay with tim and young mi (well...ym was in paris most of the week), in our favorite sf spot. we didn\\'t have as much contact this time because we were out the door early every morning for nanny duty with our granddaughter. but as always we felt well-\"hosted.\"  warm, comfortable digs.  our highest recommendation...we\\'ll be back!one of the best places ever! it was really great staying there!staying with tim and young mi was a dream. not only was their place exactly as luxuriously decorated as the pictures show, but they are kind, warm, generous, and extremely welcoming. tim and young mi provided us with great restaurant and sightseeing recommendations, and we were very comfortably accommodated throughout our stay!we loved our stay at tim and young mi\\'s well located and tastefully decorated  victorian house. the neighborhood was quintessentially sf and super close to fantastic bakeries, restaurants, shopping streets and parks. hosts were friendly and respectful. our only regret is that we couldn\\'t have stayed longer!we stayed in this beautiful victorian house for two brilliant nights and had a warm welcome by tim, young mi and their two dogs. we had an absolutely fabulous time. the house is centrally located. the bedroom and bathroom are wonderful. tim and young mi provided coffee, tea, pastries, water....\\r\\nwe were free to use their dining room and had a lot of privacy. thank you again for making our stay so comfortable. highly recommended!spent a wonderful week here with my mom:) the place is very comfortable, feels just like staying at home. tim and young mi are super friendly and welcoming, and tag & trixie are the cutesttt!!(get well soonxoxo) the neighborhood is great, so many good restaurants nearby and plenty nice shops. transportation is really convenient, too. a great place to stay in san francisco, can\\'t wait to come back!!tim and young mi were great hosts.  i booked the room for my parents to stay for a week.  they really enjoyed their stay and had a great time.  tim was super responsive. \\r\\n\\r\\nit is located in a very convenient location with great restaurants (one of the best bakeries in sf) and bars nearby within walking distance.  public transportation is nearby or just a short uber ride away to most tourist attractions.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni will definitely book again in the future.  it was my first experience of using airbb and travelgeek made it great. the house was clean and cozy. they\\'ve just opened so the beds and everything were brand new.  lucky me ;) and the ocean views from windows are amazing indeed. i had stayed in sf many times before, but i didn\\'t know about sunset neighborhood . and i should say i will def stay there again. coffee shops and restaurants are cheaper ( grubbin\\' and house of pancakes is my fav). i felt safe even while walking at nights. travelgeek is great communicator and she was very helpful for us . i was enjoying staying with her, def will stay again. wonderful stay, even if we could only be there for one night!  our hosts were very welcoming, the house is clean and perfect for a relaxing night in or meeting other travelers.  definitely will stay again if i\\'m in the area!aya was a great host! they went far and beyond to make me feel comfortable and at home. the neighbourhood is quiet, the house is new, modern and the appliances are high grade. love the place and whenever i\\'m in sf i\\'ll stay with them again. good value for money. this place is flawless! the hosts are very friendly and available at most of the time. the seaside view from the kitchen is great. the house is very clean. the neighbor is very quite, and you can go to the rail station in 5-6 mins. amazing restaurants of affordable price are nearby. great for meeting new people. i would definitely visit this place again!  the host was great and quickly responded to my messages. i felt welcome and checking was a breeze. very nice home with a nice common area and kitchen with all the appliances at my disposal. clean kitchen and bathroom. the area is a nice neighborhood and i felt safe parking my car on the street. overall my stay was great and exactly what i was expecting.everything was great. very low key stay. great views! over all a pleasant stay. the house was clean and our hosts were friendly. the best part was the beautiful view from our room!nice apartment very well located next to a tramway station. our room was comfortable with a very beautiful view on the ocean. the communication with travelgeek was easy.this place is amazing!!!! hosts and live in host were fantastic and extremely helpful. the place was clean, well organized and guests were trustworthy and respectful. bed was comfy, i felt very safe, the ocean view breathtaking and overall i had a lovely stay.\\r\\nthis is a very nice place. you are directly in the city and able to be a part of the daily life of san francisco. it is very clean, spacious and has a nice interior.  we really enjoyed our staying in there. the house was very clean and the host and other guests were friendly. this was our first airbnb stay, and it was great!  our host met us at the door to walk us in and give us a quick tour.  great quiet neighborhood one block from golden gate park.  the place itself was very well put together; compact but efficient, and very nice overall.peter was an excellent host.  the house was perfect for my family\\'s stay.  lots of room for everyone.  the house is a beautiful traditional san francisco home with the bay windows, bright warm living room and artistic gas fireplace that works!!\\n\\nthere were plenty of beds for us and we were quite comfortable.\\n\\npeter had lots of great suggestions on the area.  \\n\\nall in all our stay was fantastic and we would stay again.the listing description was not accurate. no washer, no dryer, no free parking on permission. \\r\\nheater didn\\'t work for at least 3 days. \\r\\ni slept with a dirty quilt one night without other options. \\r\\n\\r\\ni didn\\'t like the owner\\'s attitude on solving problems by denying his responsibility on the description. \\r\\n\\r\\ni paid for everything on that description. i don\\'t think a \"sorry\" worth that much. \\r\\n\\r\\ndon\\'t treat a foreigner like an idiot. peter was a great host and the place was even nicer in person than in the descriptions or the photos.  everything seemed brand new! the place is really big! \\r\\n\\r\\nso nice to have the clothes washer and dryer in the unit, it\\'s so convenient. same goes for the dishwasher,  microwave, free premium cable,  very high speed (55 mbps) wireless internet, which was key to our business, and the central heat worked great.  \\r\\n\\r\\nmy 4 friends and i had it arranged in a 5 bedroom configuration, and that did limit the common area to the large kitchen and the dining area that we used as an office. in the 5 bedroom set up the back office is used as a bedroom and so is the front living room.  all 5 bedrooms do have \\'real\\' beds, windows, and each has an available closet. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is brilliant! we walked to restaurants, bars, grocery, coffee, etc, and we were right on the bus line for easy access (10-15 minutes) to our start up business incubator office space downtown. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would think the space would be great for families or a startup group like ours. peter lives in a separate unit downstairs. he was available for eventualities and a few nice spaghetti dinners along the way but was invisible to us otherwise. we highly recommend the place for other visitors to san francisco. peter was a great host and always very helpful. for instance, when i asked him for a hair dryer he immediately went to buy one, which was very nice. there was enough room for our two families (6 kids and 4 adults), although some of the beds would have been a bit small for adults. the kitchen and the bathroom were functioning well. the flat is a good base for visiting san francisco, and is good value for money, although you should be aware that it is not brand new any more. but peter makes up for all potential shortcomings by being very attentive and a great host. peter was a great host, very communicative in advance of our arrival and everything was super-smooth at \"check-in\" including peter being on site for a chat and orientation.  his place was perfect for a group in town for 10 days, with plenty of fridge space, etc.    the neighborhood was aok, and there were places to eat and a grocery store nearby.  the house is close to the freeway, critical as we were traveling into downtown sf every day.peter is the great host! he respected out privacy and all our staying was smooth. one little issue - rooms in real life little smaller than on photos but on the back of one room you can find amazing view from balcony. definitely recommend peter\\'s house.peter was a great host! very helpful with nearby locations, to grab a bite and even a drink! house is very spacious, worked well for a group of 8 people. community is great and very quite. love that he gave us a lot of privacy. great home for a trip to san fran!! peter was awesome! it was a quiet neighborhood. peter is extremely friendly and helpful, and made sure that we were well taken care of.  tons of space and bedrooms with two separate balconies with a view.   even though peter place has only 1 bathroom how ever he did everything he could to make the trip awesome for me and my family. he reapond super quick as long as he s not at work. he brought stuff for us such as toilet paper and shampoo in the middle of the night. just awesome!this was our first time renting through airbnb, and we would happily do it again. geoff and his family were very accommodating, going out of their way to find us sold out tickets to alcatraz, suggesting restaurants, jazz clubs, and other favorites in the city. their house was perfectly clean, and they had left us a binder chock full of information about the house and the neighborhood, maps of the city, and plenty of takeout menus. when we arrived, we found a pitcher of iced tea, a vase of fresh flowers, and a bottle of wine waiting for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was beautiful, perfectly sized for our family of four, and aptly located a block away from a bustling street full of fantastic restaurants and coffee shops. we absolutely loved san francisco and can\\'t wait to visit again! many thanks to geoff and his family for their wonderful hospitality.\\r\\n\\r\\nsureshthank you for sharing your home. everything was great!we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the \"home in the heart of the mission.\"  the owner, geoff, provided a great deal of information as to the places of attraction, where to eat, and local must sees.  we were pleased with the ease of communication with the owner before we arrived and during our stay.   the location of this home was perfect for walking around the area, dining, shopping, etc. and was a convenient commute (we rented a car) for the other sites in the san francisco area.we stayed at geoffs house in the mission for 2 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. it was home from home. geoff was great before we travelled helping us get up to speed with the house and the area.  the house was well equippied and very well located.the hosts are very nice,friendly and tidy. moreover, the house is awesome!! fantastic week away and would highly recommend to others.amazing host! amazing place.\\r\\n\\r\\nrish\\'s roommate, jeev was not only accommodating - he made himself always available and allowed us to use the apt freely. he recommended spots and always inquired about our days/nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould totally come back here again! loved it here!i stayed here over president\\'s day weekend and had a wonderful time. the loft is extremely spacious and beautiful. i stayed in the upstairs bedroom which had it\\'s own private bathroom which was extremely nice. the host and his roommate were both very accommodating and i was given a lot of recommendations prior to arrival. i would definitely stay here again with friends as the area is convenient and ubers were very accessible. some people might be turned off / anxious at staying at a shared airbnb. let me ease your fears with my marvelous tales. i speculated staying here because to be honest, most airbnb\\'s close to soma are either expensive as hell or garbage.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen you look at rish\\'s airbnb profile, yes their place is that beautiful. yes, i did trust my gut and assume correctly that good loft pictures + rish having a stylish hairdo = him and his friends were super hospitable and didn\\'t attack us in the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nrish was super flexible in discussing which room we\\'d stay in. my fiancée and i stayed in the twix room, while my other friend decided to sleep on the huge couch. (he doesn\\'t like air mattresses. i know, he\\'s crazy.)\\r\\n\\r\\nwe stayed there for a week for gdc, and it was the best. it\\'s only a 10 min walk to market street or the moscone, you don\\'t feel like you\\'re going to get attacked if you walk in the neighborhood, and if you don\\'t know where to go in san fran, rish has a magical tome that upon summoning from the heavens he can give you a list of the best sights, restaurants, bars, and oh so much more.\\r\\n\\r\\nrish + company were also excellent hosts. they elegantly checked in enough that i felt that i was staying somewhere with friends but not too much like my grandmother probably would if i stayed at her house.\\r\\n\\r\\ni mean what else can i say? staying here was so good that i\\'m 99.5% sure i\\'m a new man. a man who now has faith soon we will live in a future where there will be more cost efficient san fran airbnbs! but until then i\\'ll just stay at rish\\'s, because nowhere else is better.rish, jeev and joan are extremely personable people who made my stay extremely comfortable and settling. it\\'s really obvious that these are good people who make sure you\\'re taken care of. this is not to mention that their house is clean, modern, and extremely spacious. it\\'s also super well located and i\\'d consider it to be among the top choices in the neighborhood (and i\\'ve stayed at a couple airbnbs in sf). seriously recommended-- 10/10\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft was amazing! i was welcomed by joan who was very nice and showed me the place. the bedroom was spacious, with a desk and a very comfortable bed. \\r\\nthe loft is filled with gorgeous light and has an incredible rooftop with 360 views on the entire city. an amazing location, close to one of my favourite sf coffeeshops: sightglass.\\r\\nthe kitchen was fully stocked with high-end kitchenware which i loved using. \\r\\nall in all, rish and his roommates were great, and i will definitely stay again here next time. thank you!!rish and his (sensitive contents hidden) are very nice people and attentive hosts. rish gave us great recommendations for food and places to visit. the place itsself is exactly as pictured, very clean and perfect location to discover san francisco. i can only highly recommend to stay here while in sf. happy to come back!rish was the perfect host helping out with finding places around and making us feel welcome. the apartment is exactly as seen in pictures, nice and clean. would visit again.great hosts at a very cool and spacious loft in soma with everything you need to feel right at home. the neighbourhood is cool and you can walk most places, though some adjacent areas do seem a little shady. other than that, can\\'t fault it and would definitively recommend staying with these guys!a wonderful stay in a great, central location!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft is, indeed, spacious, very comfortable and as pictured.  it\\'s in a sunny part of san francisco (a city known for its microclimates!) and even boasts a wonderful rooftop deck. the neighborhood is very urban with great restaurants and a fantastic craft coffee shop a short walk away. the two floors of the studio have a very cool and chic air thanks to the towering ceilings and the hip artwork compliments of one of rishabh\\'s roommates who works in an art studio. the lower floor (which houses two of the bedrooms) is more basic, but is very spacious and comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe best part of my stay, however, was the warmth of jeev, the third roommate and the roommate who was around during my stay. he greeted me with a friendly smile, insisted on carrying my suitcase up the stairs and gave me a great tour of the loft and the building. he even invited me to join him and a friend for dinner. thanks, jeev, for making me feel so at home!rhishabh was a fantastic host who made my family and i feel welcomed from the moment we walked in. he was polite and gave us suggestions on places to see and eat. he even checked on us daily to let us know that we could contact him at any time with questions about the city or the loft. the loft was great spacious and roomy just like the description said, it is not in the smack middle of busy san francisco, but a $7 uber away from there. which i prefer because it was nice to feel some sense of privacy that you couldn\\'t get a hotel in the city. i would gladly like to return here the next time i\\'m in san francisco.the space was amazing! rishabh and jeev are super cool and friendly and helpful, and even cooked me breakfast (that\\'s real airbnb). the place was so big for that area. and decorated like a gallery. full room upstairs with own bathroom, and great location. best place i\\'ve ever stayed at.rishabh was super accommodating and welcoming. i had everything i needed to feel comfortable in the apartment and have absolutely no complaints about my stay. also, the apartment itself was definitely the coolest apartment i\\'ve ever stayed in.i loved meeting rish and the beautiful home he provided the moment i walked in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nit is a beautiful space that makes you feel you can chill out at home between all the action on the streets.  surrounded by beautiful art and lovely people - what more could you want. rishabh was very friendly and accommodating, and the loft is a pretty cool space! i highly recommend staying here.great hosts.  great place.  solid location within walking distance of the moscone center and matreon.this place is a clean and spacious unit.  good for a big group.  we had a very positive experience with our stay. public transportation is very easy here.  very close to the highway.  the owner was very quick with his response. highly recommended.the space was great for our small group.  we had a people leaving san francisco over a 2 day period, and public transportation is right outside.  the kitchen had a few hospitality supplies which was nice, and there was lots of open space. the apartment was bright, spacious and clean. the description was accurate, parking was difficult as it always is in sf. coleman answered all my questions and met all accommodations requested. the neighborhood was busy and bustling with people. i didn\\'t use the transit system as much as i would have liked but it was nice to know that i had the option. description is accurate, had a great time in the apartment!the home was exactly as described, and a very good deal too. the neighborhood is the best, but once you\\'re inside, there\\'s no need to worry about safety. the interior is nice and the beds were comfortable. plus, wonderful showers! the only constructive piece of feedback is to stock the house with more dishes. there\\'s only enough to supply one person (if that) for cooking dinner.  there\\'s plenty of plates, cups, and utensils. i just think more pots, pans, baking dishes/sheets, a strainer, and a cheese grader would be a good addition to the house. we were quite pleased with our stay. the apartment was clean and spacious, perfect for a group of 8-10. kitchen was fully useable with enough pots and kitchenware although we did not cool during our stay. the breakfast cereal, bananas, coffee and bags of ice in the freezer was a nice touch. beds were extremely soft and comfortable. towels were also nice and soft. although i did not have much face to face interaction with coleman any questions i had coleman responded in a timely manner.  the muni was very convenient and got us downtown in about 30 minutes as stated and is quite convenient as it literally stops in front of the apartment. i highly recommend if you don\\'t have to stay in downtown and don\\'t want to drive around. overall it was a pleasing stay at the apartment. well worth it compared to staying in a motel. accommodation was basic but had plenty of space to accommodate the 5 of us. we got there late & there was no where to eat or purchase any amenities so if your traveling stop off for the basic. in the morning got the bus across the road to the centre which was great but had to get a cab home. all in all for 5 separated clean rooms in san fransisco (maybe not in the centre) good value for money the listing was accurate. he was very responsive. what you see is what you get. the place is great for a big group. the fact that he offers the parking space to us was a big plus. the stay was nice, very large, with lots of room for family. you definitely get the san francisco living feel.the apartment is great!  we  really enjoy our days in san francisco.  i recomend it.stayed in the apartment with a group of 7 people. apartment was large and clean. layout is a little awkward since one of the bedroom and bathrooms can only be accessed by going through a bedroom instead of the common area. the living room was large and was a nice area for us to hang out.  \\r\\n\\r\\none person got to the apartment before the check in time but coleman was nice enough to allow her to stay and settle in. \\r\\n\\r\\nlocation was decent. apartment is located in a residential neighborhood with not many stores or restaurants, but it was very close to mass transit. parking spot was very convenient since finding street parking in the neighborhood would have been very difficult. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall we had a very good experience and recommend this space for a large group of people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwe enjoy our stay. thanks!very accurate listing. very large space & clean.the apartment was very spacious and clean. the street car came right out front and access to highways was easy.the description matched the reality we found, and the host was a nice person whom i happened to meet on the last day. the apartment was spacious and clean and in a neighborhood that was relatively quiet except for the regular run of the street car. will definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family.easy, convenient, clean. instructions are plain and simple, rules are standard, overall my time here was just what i needed; spacious, plenty of rooms and clean. the room is super big and clean. we love it.very clean place, met all of our needs! great access to public transportation. a perfect place for a group or family traveling together!what a wonderful little apartment! we traveled with a few friends for a weekend in san francisco and this place was perfect for our needs. it\\'s right along the muni line, so we could walk out the door and hop a train into the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nthere\\'s a common area with a well-adorned kitchen, making it easy to have breakfast, sit and play cards, or just read quietly.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe only downside to this place is that the noise from the street car can be a little much. but the bedrooms are all placed on the other side of the apartment, making it easy to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe didn\\'t encounter our host during the trip, but all of our communication before the trip was perfect. he was quick to respond and address our questions, and he made sure we knew how to get in touch with him in the event we needed him during our stay.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe little touches, like the coffee maker and copious supply of coffee and sweetener, was a huge win for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe\\'d stay here again!the unit worked really well for my family and my friends. there were 9 of us. the rental was clean, comfortable, and large.  beds were comfortable, easy parking (for sf).  mr. maher was easy to communicate with and  accurately describes his rental unit.  the living room has a tv with roku and there are adequate kitchen.  close to public transportation, right out the front door!  a good rental at a fair price. pretty good place. fits 9 comfortably.i stayed one night with my wife, baby, mom and dad. the street and neighborhood this flat is located on is low income and there were sketchy people on the street corner. i did not feel comfortable having my family outside the apartment, luckily we arrived when it was light outside.\\nthe flat inside was nice and pretty clean, however it had a bad odor, it smelled like sour curry, which made the stay unpleasant. i brought this up to the host, but he said neither him or the cleaners smelled any bad odor, in other words saying that i was just making it up inorder to \"fish\" for a partial refund as the host said. least to say i will not rent from this host again.description accurate ; you will have what you see on pictures. nice big flat, large enough to fit our group of 9 people. dinning room and kitchen were great for family breakfast and dinner. cleaning could be improved. the public transportation - right in front the street - will get you very easily to all kind of sf places. the neighborhood itself is safe, there is a family market right in front the place (expensive) and a public park at 1 block in case you have kids that are not tired of a full day in sf (better to let them running in the park than in the flat, that can bother the people leaving below ...).the listing description is accurate. the place was roomy and comfortably housed my family of 8. the neighborhood did not look to be the best at first but it was quite and the people were warm and welcoming as was the host. the streetcar stopped right in front the house which was great after a long day of walking exploring the city. mr. maher was incredibly responsive to my requests. you have a beautiful place. spacious and clean.\\r\\nthe only problem that we had was that we had the feeling that we had to walk on eggshells due to the fact that the wooden (very beautiful) floor is an disturbance for those staying below.\\r\\none has to know for sure that one can and will be very quiet between 12 and 9. the smallest noise is noticed. \\r\\none can aspect tourist to stay out late  and might make some noise when they walk in the house. \\r\\nbut if you can really be very very (url hidden) is a beautiful house and it is easy to go to towngood location. nice property. some good things and some not at good. overall a good place to stay for the price. \\n\\npros: location. good size. metro stop right outside. nice interior. \\n\\ncons: trolley right outside. wood floors transmit all sounds (not good for kids). great experience. he was a very good host. coleman is very friendly and ready to help anytime with any issues. the apartment is very nice and exactly the same as described in the listing. the unit can easily accommodate 8 of us very comfortably. it is convenient to take public transport from this place to downtown sf and other attractions. all my family enjoyed staying at this place and we will definitely come back again!we had an excellent time at coleman\\'s place. it was very clean and accommodating. the space was great for our sf weekend and was also very conveniently located next to a muni station (although we didn\\'t need to use it). it was pleasant to sleep there too; quiet and comfy beds. kitchen was equipped with a stove and coffee maker which we used to make breakfast. i would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to get away and enjoy sf. you definitely get the local sf experience with this apartment. the apartment was great. it is beautifully done and very spacious. it is located in a gorgeous area and has some parking in front. \\r\\nmy interactions with coleman were less charming. i called the day of to verify that everything was still set for us to arrive and to make sure that there weren\\'t any changes or additional information we needed before the stay. he was fairly rude on the phone, only replying with one word answers and a general sense that my speaking with him was annoying him. i shook it off and attributed it to maybe having a bad day. \\r\\nwhen we were ready to check out, we had cleaned the house and made the beds and piled all of the used towels into one room. he was very strict that we be out of the apartment at 11 am sharp, which is very understandable, so we made sure that we were doing the final sweep of the house when he pulled up at 11. everyone minus the last person was down below and packing the cars. i said hi when he pulled up and he just looked at me and didnt say a word. i told him we were completely out and to let us know if he\\'d like us to do anything else. still just a look. he then went into the building and came out 5 minutes later and said that we needed to get off of his property. so we shoved everything in the cars and drove down the block to finish packing everything. \\r\\nthe only negative part of the stay was having to interface with coleman. we paid him a lot of money to be able to stay there and we made sure that we were quiet and respectful and left the flat exactly how we found it, but he couldn\\'t be bothered by actually providing any amount of customer service to us. the place is so beautiful! really great location, since there is public transportation right there, or a quick drive to downtown. really specious and cozy, perfect for large groups! coleman was always quick to respond to any questions we had. listing description was accurate home was clean, train out front is a bit on the loud side, but the stay was nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nno surprises, which when it comes to airbnb\\'s is a good thing!the place is nice with lots of room for everyone. but the downside is could\\'ve use a fresh linen. there\\'s still some hairs on the sheets probably from the last renter. also coleman needs to work on his social skills. a little smile once in a while should do. also the parking spot is so tight it hardly fit an suv. but overall i like the place except for the parking space and the sheets.the home was very inviting a clean. my party was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. close and easy for public transportation. i would recommend it. the listing description was accurate.  since this was for my two daughters and their families i did not experience staying there myself but i did see the property and it is nice.  it is on the second floor of three floors.\\r\\n   i have to apologize for some communication misses.  since i booked it close to a month in advance i forgot some of the details like the house rules which were available online but i was having difficulty getting to.  a couple of months ago we all stayed at a house in london which was a different experience with  the owner greeting us and with a booklet at the house explaining the rules, which everyone could read.  i recommend this as my daughters did not see the house rules online though i explained it to them.\\r\\n   evidently their two year old daughter was running around (without shoes before 9:00 pm) and it disturbed the person living downstairs.  so, it seems sound travels very clearly and my apologies to that tenant and coleman.\\r\\n   they loved the beds!  they said they were the most comfortable they\\'ve been in and they loved the sheets.  parking can be difficult but we expected that.\\r\\n   all in all an interesting and favorable one night stay.as advertised this is a spacious unit in a quiet residential neighborhood.  it\\'s a bit far from downtown, but close to the freeway, public transit and it\\'s easy to get an uber/lyft.  the place was nice, clean, and accurately described by the listing. coleman was a welcoming host, and made sure we were aware of house rules. would definitely recommend this location!the apartment was easy to access and lovely and spacious when we arrived. a few odd cleaning rags here and there but we managed to clear them up. this is an excellent apartment to rent if visiting sf with multiple families or friends. it\\'s close/ walking distance to mission st and the team was convenient too. the first night we were there though, there seemed to be noise (footsteps/bags or something) moving around at 4;30am which woke some of us. this was a little frustrating as we all tried to be super diligent about the noise after 9pm as the floorboards were quite noisy even with shoes off. street parking was ok and not too painful too. the listing was as described. except for one very squeaky bed everyone slept well. we could have used a few more chairs otherwise the apartment was clean and had everything we needed. i would rent it again. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe fire alarm is very efficient and would wake the dead, so be careful to clean up drips before baking the second pizza!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe parking situation can be tricky but all the guests were from the bay area and knew how to work around it.  some used bart and others just hunted until they found a spot.this place was perfect for our needs. four big bedrooms. plenty of room to stretch out. good location in between the valley and downtown.  public transportation in front and always easy to get uber or lyft. we would stay here again.it was a last minute booking and everything was excellent. communication was simple and easy and there\\'s a market across the street for your needs. house was clean and everything was where it needed to be. great place, super clean. great place, clean and plenty of space! and coleman was very responsive...coleman was accommodating for our group of nine. he let us leave our bags in the apartment as we arrived in san fran before the check in time. he was also very quick in replying to messages if we needed any help. the description of the apartment is accurate and is spacious yet warm and cozy. the public transit literally stops outside the house and it takes 40 mins to get to downtown san fran. this was a worrisome and difficult work trip, and overall it ended up working out great.  originally we were going to have 5 people staying, which ballooned to 9, so i was worried about a lot of the logistics, but coleman was super helpful and communicative throughout the process.  checking into and out of this airbnb was super easy.  \\r\\nthis was a great place for a couple families, not ideal for a large work group, but it was definitely the right price and worked for super bowl weekend.  got lots of bright sun, parking was easy (in the space), and the neighborhood was quiet.  the wifi worked beautifully as well, which is always one of my biggest pet peeves. \\r\\nthe only drawbacks i would say were the loud muni right outside (it didn\\'t bother me in the back, but those in the living room were pretty sensitive to it) and there aren\\'t many places to walk to, although we found a great spot to brunch on sunday.  also, the place could have been cleaned better before arrival, with the kitchen and floors a bit dirty (there was trash under some of the beds).  still, for the money and space, it was a good deal!the place was great! clean and in a perfect location. coleman was a great host and everything was right on point.listing was accurate.  we were definitely satisfied.   coleman was a great host, and his apartment was fantastic. he helped us out when we needed wifi support, and was very kind. the apartment was extremely close to the metro, which really helped us explore san francisco. coleman’s place was great. the apartment is huge, and there are plenty of beds for a large group. we had 11 people and were well accommodated. the location is great (very close to public transport), the space was clean, and the internet was dialed. coleman was informative when we had any questions and always got back to us right away, and otherwise let us do our thing without interference. no complaints here, and i will return for sure next time i’m in the bay area.great host with clean apartment. the space was huge and tv had many channels to enjoy while staying here. there is a local corner store across the street. there is also a train that runs down  the street through out the day/night and depending on how you\\'d like to experience sf this can be enjoyable or a bit noisy. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall good listing and would stay again if i had larger group. the host provide dinner and toothpaste for us out of the kindness of their heart! thank you \\r\\n\\r\\nps: they have awesome body wash in the showers \\r\\ncoleman was an accommodating host for our group of 12.  when notified the heat may not be working and one of the extra air matrices had a hole in it he promptly resolved the issues.  the house worked out perfectly as we where all able to sleep comfortably and enjoy public transpiration which stopped in front of the house.\\r\\nthank you. actual area is bigger than photos see feeling. parking is not easy!the home was very large and accommodated our sleeping of 7 people comfortably. the home in general was clean. i felt the kitchen could have been cleaner. the kitchen was also not stocked well at all. there was only 1 wine glass, odd and end dishes, utensils and glasses for maybe 5-7 people. no dish towel, extra garbage bags or basic cooking supplies. the host did bring us a crock-pot when we requested one. the oven and refrigerator really need to be fixed or replaced. if the kitchen were better i would  give the home a higher rating. with that said, for the price the home it served us well.  nice place. everybody has been satisfied and coleman is very reactive. he responds promptly our messages and quickly fixes the problem. we definitely recommend this apartment.we are extremely lucky to have cheresh to be our perfect host. she welcomed our family into the warm and comfortable home with detailed information about the house and neighbourhood. it has made a memorable vacation in sf and we sincerely thankful for letting us stay. the house is incredibly comfortable with lots of entertainment. the neighbourhood is safe and convenient.  we would definitely stay at cheresh house again. great spacious top floor conveniently located, few minutes from all major locations truly great experience i  highly recommending !!!! very nice room and people! ben and robin were responsive and great hosts. i did not stay at the house myself but my colleagues that were training from our other office stayed there and enjoyed every part of the house. overall, definitely recommend this house and the hosts were accommodating.my family and i really enjoyed our stay at this property in san francisco.  we were first time airbnb users in town to celebrate our daughters wedding.  the house was just what we needed for our family and our host was very accommodating.  between the local bart station about half a mile away and uber, we were able to get anywhere we needed/wanted to be.  we also did plenty of walking/exploring...great neighborhood.  i\\'d recommend this home to my friends...i stayed at this house with six colleagues. it was spacious enough for all of us to have a sense of our own space. the house is architecturally designed and  immaculately decorated.  it is located in on of the oldest and most vibrant neighbourhoods of san francisco, which is going through an accelerated gentrification process. it is in walking distance of some of the greatest authentic mexican restaurants and bakeries. the mission bart station is 10 minutes away, which is making it easy to travel to bay area. we had a rented car and didn’t have any problem with off street parking. \\r\\n\\r\\n the house does not have ensuites bedrooms. the sound insulation is very bad. you hear every sound in the house from everywhere. we found poops of the raccoons on the terrace everywhere. the host provided all the necessary information in advance. the check in details were sent in advance, very structured and accurately. we struggle at first with the wifi connection, but that was because we didn\\'t print out the instructions from the mobile app in advance, and due to lack on internet in our mobiles, it took as a while to figure it out. i would advise the host to prepare a printed card in the listing for internet details, as this could prevent a similar mishap in future with other guests, especially who are not local. the house was magnificent itself, just as described. very big house, although the acoustic may be considered by someone rather disturbing, not much privacy due to the noise being heard from different floors. the view is spectacular form the balcony and i must say, we\\'ve enjoyed it a lot! however, the beautiful sauna and jacuzzi could never been enjoyed by us, due to lack of instructions and an additional fee for the sauna as per house rules. given the price of the house, this should be included, either the nightly price increased slightly, as it just doesn\\'t offer that feeling of being welcomed. lots of signs \"do not enter - dangerous\", not sure what this was about, but we followed the instructions accordingly. some things require host\\'s attention, like shower and doors handle, as they fell off once we touched them, nothing major, but needs maintenance. i believe the place is a great experience for a group that likes to enjoy the modern unique style and design of this house, i was rather expecting more comfort and cozy environment, but nevertheless, we appreciate a lot host\\'s responsiveness to our messages, who timely got back to us, providing all the necessary information. thank you for having us!while this is a great property in theory the whole experience was subpar honestly. \\r\\n\\r\\ni don\\'t know who ben is but we dealt with someone else and communication was inflexible and somewhat sporadic. we also had to download the (sensitive contents hidden) app in oder to get all checkin information, which is ironic considering this was booked through airbnb. not a great first impression. checkin and checkout are more restrictive than i have ever experienced in my more than 150 airbnb stays - or any hotel for that matter. key exchange is handles through a lockbox. \\r\\n\\r\\nas mentioned, this is a spacious property with a distinct style - but it\\'s very clear that while it was initially furnished / build out with very high standards it\\'s not maintained very well in the face of changing guests. the light switches are impossible to figure out and don\\'t work, door knobs are falling off and the bathroom appliances need maintenance. the cleaning job was done superficially before we moved in so everything appears a bit run down. \\r\\n\\r\\nmost of all, though, for almost 1000 dollars a night i would expect some flexibility, hospitality and a few amenities. there isn\\'t so much as a single bottle of water in the fridge, no toiletries but instead one gets to read a long list of no gos (like \"no bar soap allowed\" which is sort of funny). there\\'s a pool that would cost extra to use. the list goes on. \\r\\n\\r\\ni was disappointed with this stay and am convinced that one could get better value with this kind of budget. this house was nice. the most impressive is the top floor, which would be a great place to host a dinner party...modern design, wrap around terrace, large open space. the second floor of bedrooms was ok...there is not a lot of privacy and some quirky features. robin was lovely and very responsive. i had a few issues and she responded immediately. i booked with juan because i was moving to sf and needed a place to stay while i searched for an apartment. it turned out to be a really great experience! \\r\\n\\r\\njuan and his roommates could not have been more inviting. their house is bright and clean, close to transit, and generally a great place to stay. i strongly recommend staying here!peihong was at home to meet us,give us keys and give help with parking. the master suite is just as pictured. spacious,very clean, loads of light and nice views eastward. peihong made us feel extra welcome with a lovely plate of fresh fruits and bottles of water. we would stay with her again.i can\\'t speak enough great things about peihong! she is beyond amazing! i live in the bay area, and i would not hesitate to book a room here again. i would not like to brag about the amazing time i had here, the other guest also happen to be just as amazing! \\r\\npeihong, the next bottle of wine is on me, i promise!!\\r\\n\\r\\nbesos!\\r\\nglenour short stay...we both miss peihong, and her beautiful home! we\\'re already making plans to go back :)i think i extended my stay about 3 times :) we didn\\'t want to leave! \\r\\npeihong has a beautiful home, and is an amazing host! she gave us a bottle of wine to enjoy! we entered her home as strangers, but left as good friends! we look forward to staying with you again peihong! see you soon!super tidy, super clean, super nice host. value stay for sf. and peihong offer a lot of helps. peihong is an excellent host. she goes out of her way to make you feel at home. the room is spacious and clean. she is very easy to contact. she is flexible with your travel schedule in terms of arrival/departure. overall a great experiencepeihong is a lovely host. upon arrival she let my husband park the rental car in her garage, she then brought him up a platter of fresh fruit to snack on. as i was flying in later, when he left to pick me up from the airport she asked him if he would like a mattress topper added to the bed for comfort. the room is large and the bathroom as well, outfitted with everything you need. loads of closet space, and some extra chocolates to snack on should you desire. she had coffee ready every morning and offered out her kitchen to help yourself to breakfast and she did even offer to make us breakfast. it is a $15- $20 uber ride to fishermans wharf, we did end up taking our rental back as it was just easier to uber around. she is just wonderful. we would stay here again in a heartbeat if/when we return to san francisco. do not hesitate to stay here.peihong was an amazing host! we loved staying at her place. it was nice and clean. she even offered us fruits when we arrived and breakfast in the mornings. i definitely recommend her. would love to stay here again super sweet host. she made me coffee in the morning!! it was a bit farther out of the city than i wanted, but the bathtub was totally worth it. not the most comfortable bed. i\\'d stay there again.as soon as i rang the door bell, peihong greeted my guest and i with generousity and graciousness. fresh fruit, water, snacks on arrival. with a wonderful welcome card awaiting in our room. every morning she made coffee and toast or eggs! you will be treated with kindness! i\\'m so glad i stayed here, i could go on. it was a great expirence. slept great too!lady peihong is more than perfect as a host. you\\'re gonna fell the warm the moment you see her. she\\'s charming passionate, she\\'s everything you\\'ve imagined for a host and a lady. the room is the biggest i\\'ve ever lived from airbnb, it\\'s really a suite house. the balcony, the spacious living room, the restroom. she just prepares everything for her guests. \"i want to make it perfect for all my guests.\" she told me. she\\'s not my host anymore, she\\'s my friend. todd was a very kind host. he has a lovely home with extraordinary views. the room and bathroom were very well kept. it was very quite and i slept well. todd made coffee every morning and made me feel welcome in his home. i highly recommend staying in todd\\'s space and i look forward to visiting again.the apartment is immaculate and beautifully renovated.  no one lives there full-time so it feels more like a rental just for you versus living in someone\\'s space.  location is very central - hosts are available by phone for anything you need.  very much enjoyed my experience and would definitely stay again.  eleanor was an excellent host. she was very welcoming and helpful. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is immaculate - a very nicely done out serviced apartment with everything you could need. it\\'s exactly as pictured. \\r\\n\\r\\nonly drawback was that the road outside the bedroom was quite noisy so might not be ideal if you are a light sleeper. the apartment was very clean and the host was prompt in addressing (via sms) our requests. the downtown location is great, facilitating easy access to many attractions. however, the street can get quite noisy in the evening (pubs, traffic). overall, we loved the place. the apartment was great! everything is brand new, mostly restoration hardware feel with a slightly modern feel. it doesn\\'t get much better than this at a hotel or airbnb. \\r\\n\\r\\nfew awesome highlights:\\r\\n-- host is really nice and easy to work with\\r\\n-- the place is brand new\\r\\n-- the location is excellent (within a few blocks of moscone)\\r\\n-- keyless entry made coming and going really easy\\r\\n\\r\\nfew potential issues to note:\\r\\n-- full size bed with foam mattress\\r\\n-- no a/c (only a slight problem if it gets warm)\\r\\n-- noisey across the street at night since it\\'s across from a nightclubthe apartment is modern and exceptionally clean.  and eleanor was great at catering to requests.  it\\'s a terrific place to stay -- situated only few blocks from union square and very walkable to the moscone center and the nob hill and lower pac heights neighborhoods.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was visiting for work and felt like i was staying in a nicely designed furnished suite instead of living in someone\\'s home. really liked that i didn\\'t need to a key; everything is passcode protected.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly drawback is the noise from the lounge across the street when the bedroom window was open. otherwise, a great place to stay.amazing place - perfectly described in the listing.  the place is very clean and close to union square.  i would definitely recommend this to anyone.the apartment is great, with a lot of taste!  we really felt very comfortable with space and layout. it really was perfect.  the location is incredible, close to everything.  highly recommended!!!eleanor was an incredible host. her home is simply amazing and in a great location! eleanor was very understanding and helpful. when we were locked out (due to confusion of the key usage), we called eleanor at 1am!! she was quick to respond and to help us out!! i could not have asked for a better host and home. i stayed for just under a week at eleanor\\'s place and was really impressed with the quality of all the furnishings - she\\'s really invested a lot in the place and it made me feel very at home! the only minor issue was some of the noise from downstairs which usually went by 11pm, but other than that i had a lovely stay. it\\'s also great not having to worry about keys with the number lock - would highly recommend. eleanor\\'s apartment is absolutely great, super clean and well equipped. the location is unbeatable, so close to union square in the middle of the city. this comes with a little noise but that was a minor issue and i can highly recommend that place.\\r\\neleanor was always super responsive if i need to know something.\\r\\n  the apartment was beautiful.  it looks exactly like the photos and is extremely clean and well kept.  the location is great for access to all parts of the city.  eleanor was a great host and very responsive (although i had no issues at all with the apartment in the month i stayed).  the only downside i feel i have to mention is that there is a bar across the street that does get pretty noisy, especially on weekend nights.suite 301 was gorgeous and extremely well appointed. all appliances and furnishings were new and high end. eleanor was a gracious host: we had some questions regarding wi-fi and she was extremely responsive and helpful.  we would definitely stay there again!what you see in the photos is what you get - and even more. this was my first experience with airbnb, and eleanor made me a believer. staying here was far more fun and easier than a hotel, and this was for a business trip. space to work. a place to have colleagues meet without sitting on the bed. a big fridge, washer and dryer. and above all a 5* hotel bathroom with a power shower and japanese-style toilet. \\r\\n\\r\\neleanor is a gracious host and takes care of everything, and also highly responsive if you have any questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nsome people write about the noise, but it is what you would expect in a big city. if you want peace and quiet, then go back to the burbs.suite 301 was awesome and in a very convenient location. all appliances and furnishings were new and high end. eleanor was a the perfect host. i would definitely stay here again.i had the most amazing time at elea\\'s apartment. the apartment is very spacious and very well decorated.  the communication with elea went very smoothly. so: highly recommended!! thanks for everything, elea !i had a wonderful week in kim and mitch\\'s brilliantly located and extremely comfortable room, and room is really under selling it, this is a fully equipped one bed apartment, with own access, bathroom and kitchenette!! located in a great part of the city with lot\\'s of options for food within 5 minutes walk. \\r\\n on arrival, kim had baked banana bread and she couldn\\'t have been more helpful and was great at responding to mails. i had the chance to talk to mitch a couple of times too, really nice guy and the their dog is super friendly. great listing, great location and great people!!!clean, comfortable and private.  exactly as advertised.  i enjoyed my stay - and felt very comfortable.this garden apartment was just a perfect place to base a stay in san francisco. it was as charming as the pictures with lots of light and a wonderful garden. the hosts\\' thoughtfulness in providing the amenities was everywhere from the muffins to travel toiletries. original art graces the apartment. the location was great for a best of san francisco experience. i would highly recommend this host.the studio was great! definitely private, essentially its own unit on the side/below the house. has everything you would need for a comfortable stay. kim was helpful with advice on the area when asked, and had more info on sf in a binder she had compiled in the studio. would recommend!kim\\'s place was amazing! one of the best airbnb experiences i\\'ve had. highly recommended for anyone looking to stay in warm, homey, private space thats extremely comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\ni stayed at kim\\'s garden studio when attending a two-days conference at the nearby ucsf campus.  the location is conveniently close to the conference center and several nice restaurants.  the studio is well maintained and decorated.  really enjoyed kim\\'s art works displayed through out the studio.  highly recommended for any travelers.\\r\\nvery nice apartment and friendly smart people. communication was also quick and easy.  strongly recommended.  comfy, cosy and convenient.cosy, comfy and convenient.comfortable, cosy and convinient.still my favourite place to stay in sf.still my favourite crash pad near to the station.last minute availability saved the day!perfect host. great communication, great apartment.words cannot describe how nice and amazing jacques is. first off his home is gorgeous. the rooms are very well furnished, large and spotless. but more importantly is how kind jacques himself is. he is exceedingly friendly and talkative and is an all around pleasure to be around. after outside lands when it was impossible to find a cab he was able to provide us a ride back to his home. even better the next morning we woke up to a gift certificate slipped under the door for his bistro which just perfectly happens to be next door. mind you it\\'s 4.5 stars on yelp and serves fantastic food. so all in all as amazing as outside lands, was jacques helped make it an even more memorable weekend. as jacques himself said, \"kindness can go a long way\".  jacques has a wonderful apartment right across from the panhandle. the beds are large and comfortable. i wish i had more time to use the upstairs kitchen, the stove looked amazing!five friends from china visiting san francisco spent two nights at jacques\\' condo. they had asked my assistance in finding three nice, but well priced, hotel rooms. this turned out to be a far better deal. the three bedroom condo is spacious and light, very clean, and exactly as pictured. wonderful location across from the golden gate panhandle, easy walking distance into gg park. jacques and his wife were very attentive and kind to the visitors, providing them a gift certificate to his restaurant. they were thrilled with the accommodations. a lovely place to stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly caveat -- someone with mobility problems may have trouble as you enter building one flight up from street level and then have another set of flights to first level of condo where bedrooms located, and then another flight to the living/kitchen are. \\r\\n\\r\\nmerci beaucoup.jacques and claude were amazing hosts and their apartment is absolutely stunning.  its in an ideal location right across from the panhandle with tons of light, outdoor space and beautifully appointed furnishings.  we had a fabulous dinner party in the huge kitchen.  we will be back!  absolute smooth sailing staying at jacques\\' amazing terrace.  such a great house and a perfect location.  super close to golden gate park which is massive and beautiful and great if you\\'re a runner.  nice 12km round trip from the house through park to beach and back.  super close to haight for cool shops and real coffee.  can\\'t fault anything about my experience.  highly recommend.  oh and jacques is a legend.  super friendly and helpful.  perfect 10.super clean. huge bedrooms. nice clean bathrooms.  great ktchen and living area.  2 blocks from the upper haight.  3-4 blocks from golden gate park. the most relaxing and fun area of sf, that is clean and safe. easy to get taxis too.this was my first airbnb experience.  we were a team of 3 engineers working in san francisco for 10 days.  our normal choice would be to book into one of the hotels around union square, but this time i thought that apartment living might represent a more attractive alternative option.  how right this turned out to be. \\r\\njacque\\'s house is amazing.  it\\'s on two floors; bedrooms (x3, with queensize beds in each) and bathrooms (x2) on one floor and then the upper floor is a fully open plan living area; an incredible kitchen area, a long counter, smarttv with audio system and sitting room area.  the living room area is really nice, spacious and superbly finished. the bedrooms are spacious and really comfortable.\\r\\nthe area (close to the panhandle) is really attractive.  we found it to be a quiet, residential area, plenty of trees with  the park nearby. streetside parking was free and easy to get, but watch out for the streetcleaning hours, clearly marked on signs.  we normally use a rental car for our san francisco visits - next time i would consider not renting a car at all and simply using uber (car and driver hire by smartphone on a journey by journey basis).\\r\\njacques was the best host you could ask for - he was a pleasure to deal with, he met me to hand over keys on arrival, we only saw him after that when we chose to see him.  he has a beautiful restaurant a few blocks away and we dined there once or twice. \\r\\ni will certainly be hoping to stay at jacques\\' place again.  after spending 10 days there, it had really started to feel like home.  i was sorry to say goodbye to the house.   \\r\\n       \\r\\n      was at a business conference in san fran and found it very refreshing to stay in this well designed, open-plan apartment (located in a charming and buzzy neighbourhood) , our host was very pleasant and has additional benefit of owning a french cuisine restaurant which was packed out with the local people. \\r\\nthoroughly enjoyed our stay.great hosts. it was a very nice place and very comfortable. definitely a great spot for sf. very convenient location. i cannot say enough about jacques & claude\\'s gorgeous place in the nopa neighborhood of sf. a few coworkers and i were in from out of town for some meetings at our hq and decided to save the company a few $$ by booking airbnb. best decision ever! first let me begin by saying that this condo looks exactly as the photos, but is more stunning in person. the moment we walked through the door and up the stairs, we were completely blown away!!! the pictures simply do not do justice to how beautiful and spotless this place is. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood itself is very cute, quiet and close to public transportation, with all the necessary conveniences (i.e. restaurants, shops, grocery store & coffee shops) to make it an exceptionally comfortable & wonderful stay. though there is no bart station nearby, its nothing a quick ride on the 21 bus can\\'t get you directly to. the only thing we were sad about was we did not get a chance to try out jacques and claude restaurant which is also in the neighborhood.  however if you are in town with them on any other day besides monday & tuesday you should definitely stop by, i\\'ve heard nothing but wonderful things :-)\\r\\n\\r\\nas far as hosting, jacques and claude were lovely. they were incredibly quick to respond to any questions we had and very accommodating the whole way through. we are bookmarking their place for future group stays in town, as well as recommending to other coworkers who might be interested. if you get a chance to come to sf, definitely stay here!  \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks for the hospitality jacques!  my daughters and i had a fabulous time in san francisco. your home is lovely and has everything a guest could desire and the location is fabulous!  thanks also for checking in with us during our stay.  you are a most gracious host.\\r\\nmerci\\r\\ndeanne \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was great.  it is large and comfortable.  very nicely decorated and well furnished.  it is in a very nice location with fantastic access to golden gate park.  the only potential concern is that it is on a well traveled street which resulted in some traffic noise at night.  beside that it is fantastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts were very gracious and supportive during our stay.the hosts were very thoughtful and the place was lovely.  our family of 6 really enjoyed this spacious home with great views of the park. jacques and claude are very friendly hosts. the home is as it appears in the photos and has all the basic comforts needed. beautiful unit that was more than advertised and impressed our entire group.  we all look forward to a return trip next year. jacques was a wonderful host.  we could not have asked for more. great experience. absolutely brilliant. the apartment is amazing, it basically has everything you could possibly want: outdoor bbq, sound system, one of the best ovens i\\'ve ever seen, comfy beds, relaxing living room. it\\'s in a great locations (only made better by its proximity to the owners\\' lovely french bistro around the corner). thoroughly recommended... i\\'ll probably never choose to stay in a hotel in sf again as long as this place isn\\'t already booked out.amazing place to stay in san francisco... great neighbourhood and great house. would have loved to stay longer!my colleagues and i had a great time at jacques\\' home. we were there for a week and enjoyed every moment of it. very spacious bedrooms and all the amenities we needed. i totally recommend the home and host for any family or small group visiting sf. where to start ! thank you so much to jacques and claude our host during our stay in september. they made us so welcome, giving us tips around and the place is stunning, calm, clean, and you really feel home in this place.\\r\\nlocation is amazing and everything is accessible very easily. i am really happy i had the chance to stay there and meet with them,\\r\\ni totally recommend this place and will for sure stay again. this listing is not a joke it\\'s a real flat with everything to make sure you will feel home sweet home.\\r\\nanother point, i slept like a baby, the bedding is high quality i call this heavenly bed ... \\r\\nthanks again guys ! \\r\\ncedric we had a great time in this beautiful home. the owners are warm & friendly and were very helpful when we arrived. our group consisted of 3 adult couples and the lay-out of the house worked very well. bedrooms are large; comfortable queen beds; and really nice linens & towels. \\r\\n  the pictures are a true representation of the home. since the bedrooms are all on the 2nd floor and the kitchen/living room on the 3rd, there are several flights of stairs involved daily.  this was not an issue for our group, but could be important to others.\\r\\n   it\\'s a nice location just across the street from the golden gate park. finding parking on the street was sometimes a challenge, but we always found a spot eventually.\\r\\nagain, jaques & claude are such nice people. they live nearby and offered to help if we needed anything. we would definitely stay here again!we had a fabulous stay.  jacques was welcoming and helpful. super neighborhood walking distance to great nopa spots as well as the haight. \\r\\nthe place is impeccably kept, nicely furnished and provided us plenty of privacy for 3 separate adult couples.     \\r\\ni would definitely recommend this lovely place for a great stay in sf.\\r\\ni traveled from new york with many days of work ahead of me. jacque and his very sweet wife greeted me at the listing as soon as i arrived. he took me around his home to show me around and pointed out the useful amenities. he also had great toiletries available! on my last day, he and his wife met me back at his listing to return the keys and say goodbye. i hope to stay in touch. the place is very cozy and easy to feel at home. also, the heater works great.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy only disappointment is that i didn\\'t have the time to visit their french restaurant. there\\'s always next time!we loved staying at jacques and claude\\'s apartment at fell st. they were very accomodating and the unit was spacious, clean, well furnished and well equipped. it was close to public transport, a great coffee shop and the golden gate park. they were extremely helpful throughout our stay. fantastic apartment in san francisco (just as described and as per the photos). great location by the park among historic houses and close to good restaurants and bars. the apartment is spacious, clean and has good sized bedrooms and a separate kitchen/diner/living room floor. the hosts are very communicative and welcoming, and everything was perfectly organised for our stay.  highly recommended, many thanks to claude and jacques for making our week so fantastic!a beautiful, clean place, with a great location and nice layout.  my colleagues really enjoyed staying here, and would do so again.was an absolute pleasure to stay at jacques! a bit farther from the main beat of san francisco, but jacques was friendly, available and an excellent host! the apartment itself is beautiful.jacques place is a gorgeous gem in one of the best locations in the city. this is a beautifully designed space will truly make you feel like a san francisco native. the place was super clean and comfortable, with 4 large bedrooms, ample amount of fluffy towels and all the amenities we could need. jacques was very welcoming and met us at the apartment to give us a tour of the place. \\r\\nthe apartment is located right on the panhandle and is a short walk from the beautiful golden gate park. thank you jacques for a wonderful stay! myself and 5 friends had a truly wonderful time at jacques beautiful apartment. the place is absolutely fantastic, very homely and welcoming. 4 very large spacious and extremely comfy double bedrooms with an entire open plan lounge and kitchen on the top floor with outside space for when the sun is shining. we couldn\\'t have asked for anything more from the apartment - it is truly stunning. jacques and his partner met us at the property to guide us round and were very communicative during the whole booking process. there was lots of towels and robes and toiletries available in the bathrooms which was a very nice touch. \\r\\nthe apartment is in a great location, we enjoyed walking to and around the haight ashbury area with all its quirky and cool shops/restaurants. i would highly recommend this apartment to any group looking to stay in san francisco! my colleagues very much enjoyed their stay at jacques\\'s appartment. they felt warmly welcomed and found the flat amazing! location was great for their needs too, and communication with jacques was very smooth. i definitly recommend! many thanks jacques for all your help!great place, great location, fantastic hosts. we\\'re coming back next year, and will try to get this house again. thank you!jacques & claude made us feel very welcome in their amazing flat. very spacious and well equipped. the 4 bedrooms are amazing. everything was clean and taken care off. we even had fresh coffee delivered! \\r\\nthe ashbury/haights/nopa is also a great area to stay in with the golden gate park right at your doorstep. i would recommend anyone to stay here! this is the second time we stay in the appartment, and we just love it. great neighbourhood, quiet and safe, golden gate park just down the street, haight street just around the corner for a bit of hustle and bustle. jacques and claude are absolutely wonderful.the recent guests loved their airbnb experience. they told us the condo was amazing, the hosts were very kind, and it was way cooler than any hotel experience. they give two thumbs up to airbnb!the house is big and beautiful,  tidy and very clean. me and my friends enjoy staying, landlord is very friendly and helpful.claude was very welcoming and helpful. we loved the apartment and thought it was the perfect set up for our family ( 2 parents, 4 twenty somethings). the place is even nicer than in the pictures, clean, spacious with comfortable beds, bedding and furniture, great showers.  we felt very much at home here and really enjoyed the uncluttered but with attention to detail ambience of the space. we had no difficulty with parking in the neighbourhood. there is shopping, cafes and restaurants within walking distance. great location for getting in and out of the city. we highly recommend the apartment and would stay here again.jacques\\' flat is san francisco is a delight. it was spacious, clean, very well maintained and perfectly located to easily get around san francisco.  the upstairs living area is a fantastic place to relax after a long day.  jacques and his wife were extremely prompt in replying to any questions we had, and got us settled in quickly.  they were gracious enough to provide us with a fully stocked kitchen and fridge and gave us full access to what was in the kitchen. their flat felt like home. i\\'d definitely like to stay there again.what a wonderful place to stay! we were three adult couples visiting san francisco, and the spacious flat provded us with a lovely, comfortable base to explore golden gate park, the haight, and other parts of the city. the rooms are spacious and the upstairs is a great place to relax, cook and enjoy conversations. we enjoyed having breakfast on the deck on the back.\\r\\n\\r\\ncommunication with jaqcques and claude was great. claude allowed us to let us store our things before the official check in time, and then came back to help another couple in. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe only concern is the noise. for three of the rooms, you definitely hear the street noise of busy fell street. just bring ear plugs and you\\'ll enjoy your stay here!\\r\\n\\r\\nterrific property and walking distance to golden gate park and other amenities. the photos were reflective of this stunning apt. this was our first airbnb experience; it was fantastic and better than a hotel stay. claude and jacques were stellar hosts and very helpful. there was a minor noise problem that they addressed quickly and they clearly care about providing a good experience. our daughter enjoyed the space and it was a relaxing stay. we would recommendmy family of 7 visited san francisco for a weekend celebration of our 40th anniversary.  the house was totally lovely...just as beautiful as the pictures show, so comfortable and inviting. claude welcomed us upon our arrival, and made us feel at ease and satisfied at the choice we made.  \\r\\nthe location was

of town for the weekend. his housemates were also very welcoming. this location is at the heart of san francisco, so it was very easy to access other nearby neighborhoods.i can whole heartedly give camila and the spencer mansion my highest recommendation.  5 starts plus!  expect an attentive and friendly host while experiencing old-world comfort in this completely unique and luxurious victorian in one of the best locations in sf.  this house  is an authentic beautiful gracious piece of san francisco history.  it is a refreshing to be outside the hustle and bustle of union square etc.  the host camilla was extremely hospitable, warm and friendly.  the room was cozy comfy and clean with lots of detail.   altogether lovely and no complaints.  absolutely brilliant !!! from her first speedy reply to my enquiry and confirmation that my dates were available,  camila has been the most wonderful host, friendly, thoughtful, helpful and such a warm and lovely person. to stay at the beautiful spencer mansion is to walk into a gracious and elegant bygone era, every room has an inviting charm, the lights and furnishings are beautiful. all of the basics a traveller hopes for are here... my bed was incredibly comfortable, a range of pillows were very good, extra covers for a cool evening were on han. it was very quiet in my room. a really good shower with lovely bath products and shampoo/conditioner were supplied. coffee/tea making facilities and fridge space in the downstairs communal kitchen were handy. the location is really good with a bus stop to downtown and some major attractions close by, and camila was ver helpful with bus numbers and advice regarding sf attractions. i would highly recommend spencer mansion. this is a wonderful and unusual place. apart from being very clean, spacious and comfortable, it has an awfu lot of charm, retained from a long-gone era. the house is a magnificent patrician mansion which is perfectly restored. every detail inside has been studied to match the outside, as antique furnitue, decoration and lampds tastefully fill this house. it is conveniently located near haight-ashburry and at a walking distance from castro, in a quiet park-side area. the cherry on the cake is the landlady: she\\'s as freindly as can be and very helpful. we\\'ve recommended it to all of our friends. great atmosphere in a marvellous restored victorian  house in a lovely neighborhood. camilla was a great host, gave good explenations and tips for s.f. we really enjoyed our stay there .\\r\\nmany good shops and restaurants nearby.a stunning house! the hosts are wonderful and make you feel right at home. the beauty of the house and its perfect location make this my #1 choice in sf. it\\'s a great value. enjoy!i live on haight but unfortunately my apartment is too small to have guests stay overnight so wanting my family to be close to me i entrusted camila with them on two separate occasions. the first being both of my parents. when we first arrived we were completely in awe of how beautiful the house is. my parents had a fantastic time (i think the house was their favorite part of visiting me). \\r\\n\\r\\nthe second time was about a week later when my younger cousin came to visit. i needed a room quickly and camila was extremely accommodating and even invited her to join for a fresh crab dinner. the rooms are beautiful and have their own private bath. living in san francisco is expensive enough but prices with staying in a hotel can be over the top. i definitely recommend a room here for fun, affordable, victorian luxury -- you absolutely will not regret it. \\r\\nthis place is amazing. best house and best host ever!!perfect place to stay in sf.\\r\\nthe spencer mansion is just a adorable place.\\r\\nmy girlfriend and me had a great time there.\\r\\nour room was just lovely. everything was as described.\\r\\nhope to go there again one day.spencer masionis a amazing! we were in queen anne room and we had a great time. the house is perfectly in the center of one of the most beautiful neighborhoods of the city and its style is crazy! the whole house is victorian style and everything  is studied in detail to be intone to the style but doesn\\'t miss any comfort, there is even the internet connection in the room. camila is a wonderful guest and it was so nice to have breakfast with her in her beautiful kitchen. we\\'ll recommend spencer mansion to all our friends who wish to visit san franciscowe booked with camila after another reservation fell through.  my sister and i really enjoyed the room, house, and camila!  everything was very clean.  like the other reviews say, the room (and house) was so awesomely victorian, but still modern where it needed to be (the shower for example).  the house smells wonderful!  it was really easy to grab a bus to go downtown and back, with a bus stop right outside the door.  there were plenty of cafes in walking distance, and we felt really safe in the haight neighborhood.  additionally, camila was very helpful with small special requests and always quick to respond via text message.  i would definitely recommend staying here if you\\'re looking for a quiet, beautiful house to sleep in with easy access to the rest of the city.  while you\\'re there, don\\'t forget to climb to the top of buena vista park (across the street) to get some amazing views of the city and bay!really nice place! comfy bed. i usually worry about sneezing in old type places like this, but i was totally fine. access was easy, good location. the only thing was the water when i went to shower was cold for a really long time (like 10 minutes time). not sure what was going on, but it got warm eventually. this is a beautiful home from a bygone era that is kept in immaculate condition.the room was clean, comfortable, and features a very large bathroom. there is a huge kitchen available for use that has all the modern conveniences, including a walk in refrigerator. the location is very convenient and is in walking distance to the hub bub of the haight district as well as golden gate park, but is situatied on a street that allows you to be sheltered from  cities noise.  while there is no provided parking space, i was always able to find a spot within 2 or 3 mins walking distance of the house. there is also a bus stop directly in front of the house. camila is a great host who literally ran ten blocks to meet me when i arrived earlier than i had originally stated. she is accommodating without being intrusive and was always available by telephone when i was out and about to answer any questions i had. she knows the city very well and recommended some great places to eat. camila said, in the future, breakfast may be offered at the house which i think would perfect this as a place to choose when traveling to sf. i was very satisfied with my stay and would recommend the spenser mansion to anyone looking to visit sf. its a refreshing alternative to the typical hotel and camila is a great host that made me feel any needs i had would be taken care of.the house is great (19th century style, strange at first but really nice). the location is good as there is a bus stop just in front of the house which leads to the best parts of sf. we have been upgraded is a larger room with garden view and that was great. we had new towels and robes everyday. the bed was made on weekdays (not on we).\\r\\nwe enjoyed the place!\\r\\ncamilla is very nice although i only met her the day of my arrival. we communicated by email during my stay and she was very helpful as regards our choice of restaurants, possibilities of parking, etc.\\r\\ni highly recommend this place!camila is a wonderful hostess and quite knowledgeable of the local area.  she was very helpful and i plan on returning to the spencer mansion on my next visit to sf.this exquisite victorian era mansion has been superbly maintained and restored.  the hardwoods, ceilings, furnishings and feel of the place are a delight to experience.  beyond that, i appreciated the cheerful and warm welcome from camila.  \\r\\n\\r\\nmy bedroom was a modest size -- but perfectly adequate for my needs and sumptuously furnished.  the gorgeous bed  was comfortable and covered with a feathery comforter, and the private bathroom was very tastefully equipped with modern shower and fittings.   apart from the low water pressure in the shower (probably an intentional and laudable water conservation choice), i can\\'t think of any criticism of this magnificent stately home and its lovely hostess.    \\r\\n\\r\\nthe 6 and 71 buses stop outside the front door (and across the street), making for frequent bus service to travel to the heart of downtown market street (or back) in 20 minutes for $2 (or 75 cents if you\\'re a senior).great place and great location. transport right out of the front door. the house was beautiful. thanks. jon and janinegreat hospitality.  very welcoming.a beautiful house with a host that went out of her way to make us feel welcome. the number 6 @ 71 buses right outside the house made getting around very easy. highly recommended. thanks camila.my days in san francisco were just perfect. the house is amazing and camila makes you feel home. she also choose wonderful people to be her guests, making the experience even better. i strongly  recommend anyone to choose the spencer mansion the place do stay in san francisco, no matter what is the purpose of your visit. \\r\\ni am looking forward to came back! the spencer mansion is a superb place to stay in san francisco. it combines a hugely convenient location with real character and superb comfort. camila is also a wonderful host, ready with recommendations and advice for the local shops and restaurants. we will definitely be back the next time we are in town.the spencer house is a uniquely beautiful space.  we love staying there. public transportation is just outside the door and very convenient and easy to use, providing access to all the wonders on the city.spencer mansion is a wonderful gem and we are so happy we discovered it. the house is

mansion next time we are in sf.dear airbnb-travellers, you will love the spencer mansion, the area, the fellow guests and most of all the hosts of the mansion. camila is wonderful and makes all the guests instantly feel at home. and what a charm of building this is. it almost should stay a secret, it is so good. then again, everyone should know about the spencer mansion and enjoy the warm atmosphere in this late 19th century victorian \"castle\" next to buena vista park. a solid 10+.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nour stay at the spencer mansion was amazing!  i can actually add it to the highlights of our san francisco experience.  the splendor of this victorian mansion was magnificent and camila was such a delight. we could walk to fine restaurants and easily get transportation to any point we wanted to go.  we will definitely stay at the spencer mansion again and highly recommend it to our friends.i had a terrific time in san francisco!  camila went out of her way to make sure i was comfortable and had everything i needed (an ironing board, a printer, bottled water, etc.).  she offered helpful advice about where to eat in the neighborhood and how to catch a quick bus to my destination downtown.  the room was comfortable, private, and beautiful, far exceeding my expectations.  what a luxury to stay in such an amazing house!  i highly recommend it.i had a wonderful stay

sure i had everything i needed during my stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was my first airbnb experience and the bar has now been set very high indeed! my husband and i stayed at spencer mansion for 4 nights and had a wonderful time! it was our first airbnb experience and we totally lucked out! the location is perfect and there are a bunch of great places to get coffee, drinks, dinner and groceries within just a few blocks. camila and carol are amazing hosts and we felt right at home immediately. i\\'d definitely recommend this to friends and we can\\'t wait to stay again next time we\\'re in town.staying in this beautiful house with camila was just a truly lovely experience. it is without a shadow of a doubt, the most beautiful house, we’ve ever slept in!  the bedrooms are breathtaking; the beds are so comfortable it was difficult to get out of them, the pillows melt around your head as soon as you lay down. there is not a peak to be heard from anybody else in the house, we felt like we were on our own. the decoration is historically perfect but with all the comfortabiltiy of modern life. we would have liked to stay longer just to enjoy the house and it’s every detail. the house is truly unique.  camila herself is the perfect host really, bubbly and energetic, and very professional, she was extremely attentive to our needs and was always available if we had a problem or any questions. even when we realized we had messed up our booking and it was looking like we were going to be sleeping on the street, she came to our rescue and helped us out without even blinking an eye. it was our first time to san francisco and we really had a great time in the city, staying in camilla’s house was just an added unexpected bonus. we make a point of never staying in the same place twice, but if she would have us, it would be our pleasure to stay there again! thanks camilla (e carolina!) we’ll be back!!though i arrived so late, camila waited for me. she was so kind and sweet with beautiful face :) house itself looks just the same as the photo herewith. it\\'s a victorian style house which we can feel the age enough but there is no problem at all to enjoy all facilities like good wi-fi, hot water&heater (since it is now a cold season in san francisco) and we are just allowed to use all the spaces like the kitchen and the living room in the first floor. \\r\\nthe transportation, there is the bus stop in front of the house so that we can take a bus to powell station easily. if you would prefer\\r\\n to have a house in the main area near powell this is not the one, but it just takes 15 minutes to get there without transfer!  and this space is close to the mountain which shows you the entire city of san francisco city scene! \\r\\nanyway what can i say i like the place very much! the spencer\\'s mansion was an amazing place to stay and i\\'d recommend to anyone visiting san fran!! it is a great location and walking distance to several great spots in the city. not to mention our great host, camilla! she was so helpful and accommodating! ill def be staying here again when i return!the spencer mansion is absolutely amazing, and camila couldn\\'t have been a nicer host! she is the sweetest most down to earth person and nothing was too much trouble. the room was everything i had hoped for and i felt like the princess i\\'m sure i was born to be haha. the definite highlight was drinking wine on the front porch in the glorious sunshine and gossiping with camila! thank you for your warm hospitality and i hope to catch up with you in ny next week!one of a kind place with victorian feeling and top standard\\r\\n\\r\\ni stayed in awesome spencer mansion for a week during my vacation in sf, and i have to say, i made the best choice. i felt like a real queen in lil\\' queen ann\\'s room. this stunning place is filled with memories of the past. very quiet but in the middle of all \"does\" of the city, every spot reachable by bus or just a walk away.\\r\\ncamila is a lovely heartfelt host, taking care of of all details of the house and pays attention for making a stay really special. i have to say, i felt more like a good friend than a guest being there. \\r\\ni will definitely come back !\\r\\nps\\r\\ncamila, spending my birthday afternoon and evening with me and ...of course just one (or two) greyhounds deluxe made this one the most unforgettable!! had so much fun. stay like you are.\\r\\nsending hugz from berlin to you and your loved ones  lovely place to stay, highly recommend! clean, unique and great location.\\nwe stayed three nights and felt so at home. camila and carol are great hosts, thank you for having us!a beautiful room in a wonderful house in an amazing location! it was the perfect springboard for exploring san francisco. we only wish we could have stayed longer - and got the chance to use the incredible kitchen. cami and carol are excellent hosts, we couldn\\'t have wished for better or easier communication. we can\\'t wait to go back.staying at cami\\'s house was amazing. she is super nice and helpful. the house itself is like a big castle, can\\'t find a better way to describe it. all the rooms have beautiful old furniture and you feel like back in time. the kitchen and living room area is huge. i can definitely highly recommend staying at cami\\'s house, you won\\'t regret it.we had a great experience! camila and carol are warm and welcoming hosts, and the spencer house is truly amazing. we wished we could have stayed longer.perfect place to stay in sf. there is a bus stop right outside for easy access to anywhere in the city and walking distance to many different areas. \\nthe room was super cozy, the bed soft and fluffy, and sheets were incredibly comfortable. even the towels were luxuriously soft. our favorite part of the room was the ceiling, you just have to see it. we kept the window open the whole time and while there was some street noise, it was minimal. i\\'m an incredibly light sleeper and as long as we used the box fan in the room all noise was drowned out. we never even heard other guests and were in bed fairly early due to our bodies being on east coast time. \\ncamila was very helpful and hospitable. she even invited us to eat with her but unfortunately it was a little late for east coast time and we fell asleep. once you get in that bed, it\\'s hard to get out!\\nthe only thing we would caution about is that the bedroom door only locks on the inside. this didn\\'t bother us as the building is well gated on the outside, but could see others feeling insecure. \\nwe would definitely recommend this to anyone coming to stay in san francisco. will be recommending to friends and hope to stay again next time we travel to sf. a beautiful room in a wonderful house in an amazing location and excellent hosts! it was the perfect stay for exploring san francisco and get a feeling of beeing king & queen. we can\\'t wait to go back.i had a simply great time at this wonderful house. cami is a great host, warm, friendly and very willing to help out with any enquiries. the house is amazing; staying there is an experience in itself. i booked into the lil\\' queen ann room, but was put into the bigger queen ann room next door, which was bigger and even better (though both rooms are lovely). the house has been done out with such fine attention to detail, and it is an absolute joy to be there. looking out the bay window of my room i felt like queen of the haight. location is fantastic - in between the two interesting ends of the haight, a short walk from the action around haight ashbury, close to the fun shops and restaurants of divisidero, across the road from the amazing views at buena vista park, walkable distance (if you\\'re a keen walker like me - best way to appreciate san fran!) to lots of places eg golden gate park, the castro and even the mission (a bit further away), and well served for public transport. the hardly strictly bluegrass festival was on while i was there and although it was a bit of a hike to that end of the park, it was quite possible and i did it each evening (saved the crazy wait to get on a bus with thousands wanting to do so all at once!). the other guests at spenser mansion were also attending the festival, which made for some great morning and evening conversations! it\\'s a quite social house, if other guests want to chat, but there\\'s plenty of space for privacy if you prefer to keep to yourself. thanks so much cami and everyone else there who made my stay so enjoyable. i would definitely come back! highly recommended as a really special base for enjoying wonderful san francisco.  what an amazing find! my boyfriend and i spent four nights at the spencer mansion in the lil\\' queen anne room and were overwhelmed by how lovely the accommodation was and all the wonderful help and advice on san francisco that cami gave us. everything is beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean and gorgeous. cami is ever so friendly and knows everything you need to know about bars, restaurants and places to go in sf. we based our itinerary on her recommendations and weren\\'t disappointed. before we visited sf we had heard that the haight-ashbury district could be a little bit dodgy at night but the house is quite a bit further down haight street than the haight-ashbury junction, and the area around the house is really lovely - we had no problems or worries at all. i can\\'t recommend this place highly enough - it is brilliant value and you\\'d be very lucky to stay here!my cousins came to visit from europe and stayed at the spencer mansion. they had a great stay! the house is beautiful, super clean, well organized. they immediately felt home thanks to camila and team. the house is conveniently located if you want to stay in the haight & asburry district and also want to travel around (direct public transportation to downtown). my cousin has a super light sleep and it took her a couple of nights to get accustomed to the noise coming from the bus stop (lil\\'quen anne room is on haight street). i\\'ll just book a room on the other side of the house for them next time. \\r\\nhighly recommended to stay at the spencer mansion! amazing place!camille was a wonderful host. energetic, friendly and extremely welcoming. her house is one of most fantastic places i\\'ve ever stayed. beautiful every detail. exactly as pictured perhaps even better. i would recommend this room to all. i stayed at camilas wonderful house for a weekend and it was exactly what i have expected. i needed a place in a nice area in san francisco with a good opportunity to get around. the bus stop in front of her house and the lines 71 and 6 are perfect. this charming house is cozy and the kitchen is very well equipped. the refrigerator is actually a cooling chamber ;-) unfortunately i had not enough time to hang more around in this fantastic house. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe room was small, but very clean and charming. concerning camila: she is such a warmhearted, helpful and charming person. you will feel like visiting a friend of a close friend ;-) you can trust on her recommendations as well: magnolia pub for dinner or the grint for breakfast. one of her passions is (wholesomely cooked) food and next time let us cook together camila ;-)  by the way, there is a very nice supermarket in walking distance with fruits, cheese, wine and a lot more (on a high german food level).\\r\\nso do not hesitate to stay in this fantastic house. thanks camila. see you again in san francisco;-) i have traveled for most of the past 2 years, and i can honestly say this may be the best place i stayed that entire time - it would certainly be top 5. cami is great, the house is gorgeous, and i loved my room - my home away from home. i can\\'t wait to come back and stay the next time i\\'m in town! if you are looking for a tremendous experience and a place to call home while in san fran, this is it!  i stayed at the spencer house for 5 nights and had a wonderful experience.  the house is extremely clean and well run and it was nice to be able to retreat back to my room for peace and quiet. camila and carol were very hospitable with tons of recommendations that were all amazing.  camila really knows her stuff when it comes to travel, food and drink. i will definitely be staying there again when i go back to san fran.  thanks again camila and carol!this was our second time staying at the spencer house and it has become our favourite place to stay in san francisco. camila is a charming and attentive host and the house itself is magical. we will most certainly be back!camila is a wonderful host and her place and this place is just awesome. i can really recommend staying here.camilla was a  terrific host and the mansion, which is the only way to describe the house, was absolutely fantastic!  camilla met us promptly and oriented us to the facilities.  this old victorian was beautiful.  camilla upgraded us to a larger room set further back from the street, but the original room would have been more than fine.  our room was beautifully furnished, the en-suite bath was terrific with plenty of towels and a giant mountain of comforters on the bed.  we had access to the entire house which was quite comfortable and decorated with great taste and charm.  there was only one other couple staying at the same time we were, so it was very quiet and peaceful.  there were several buses right outside the door and restaurants and grocery stores within a couple blocks.  we will definitely recommend this place to our (url hidden) fact we took our san francisco friends on tours of the house when they picked us up to go out on the town.  two thumbs up!we really enjoyed our stay in this charming lil\\'queen anne room. the space is as shown in the photos and something even more. the moment you step in you feel you\\'re either in a dream or in a film setting. i didn\\'t have the time to enjoy the other lovely common used spaces of the spencer house but the whole vibe and the hosts\\' hospitality and responsiveness can definitely make you fall in love with it. upon arrival i was greeted warmly by carol.  she gave me a tour of the beautiful spencer house.  her husband has some artwork up and we talked about her own illustrations.  wonderful to meet other creatives in the world so talented. the house is completely like the photos, gorgeous, elegant rooms, well lit, and super clean.  i took so many photos!  lil\\' queen anne room was perfect.  comfortable bed, really nice sheets, high ceilings, beautiful light and nice windows which provided a nice breeze of fresh air.  the bathroom was perfect - so clean.  i really liked the shampoo and conditioner too, did wonders to my hair.  even though it\\'s been restored to old victorian splendor with every detail, it felt warm, cozy and modern.  i really think a huge part is because camila and carol were such delightful hostesses!  camila shared wine and food with me one night and we had an animated conversation of our bi-coastal living between california and ny.  it was so fun to talk food and drink especially sushi!!!  you also can\\'t beat the location, the 71 is right out in front and it\\'s walking distance to golden gate park, buena vista and alamo square.  easy to get to any part of the city from this house.  i will definitely be returning to this house every time i visit my friends in sf!!! obrigado camila and carol for a lovely stay!  i hope to keep in touch and see you around the world!i had a fantastic stay at camilla\\'s place. she was very welcoming and warm when i arrived. the room and house were beautiful. i was staying in san francisco for business and i would definitely chose to stay here again instead of a hotel. the area is really nice with lots of great restaurants and bars. a big thumbs up for spencer house and camilla!another wonderful stay with cami and carol.  these energetic and attentive hosts are devoted to their guests\\' having the best possible experience of the city.  the house is gorgeous and very comfortable.  you have the use of the entire, huge downstairs.  there is a walk-in cooler in the kitchen and each room has it\\'s own wire basket within to keep your food.  the house provides coffee, tea, and other snacks.   the location seems very safe to me and it is close to shops and restaurants while away from the downtown tourist fray.  i cannot imagine a nicer stay in sf!amazing stay at the spencer house. could not have asked for a better stay. perfect location for seeing san francisco and perfect hosts. made our trip very easy. it was my second stay at spencer house and cami was a welcoming host.  lil\\'queen anne room is cosy and comfortable.  thanks cami and carol.this is the 6th or so time i have stayed at spencer house so i must like something about it. as usual cami and carol were great, the room was spotless and perfect.beautiful house in a great location with wonderful hosts! we stayed here for 3 nights and will definitely come back again!!  there is no other place i would stay in san francisco than at cami and carol\\'s home.  they are warm, generous and sincere people.   the house is a lovely combination of comfort and sophistication. the attention to detail is so appreciated.  every moment shared with them was a pleasure.  there were great morning conversations with them and the other guests around the kitchen island.  there were other moments of quiet reading and writing in the parlor and the desk in the front room.  the location is also amazing.  walking distance to so many things that make san francisco great.  i intend to return this november without a single hesitation.  thank you guys!  \\r\\ncami and carol always make me feel like i belong. they are truly amazing and the best hosts you can wish for.\\r\\ncami amd carol were amazing and all i could ask for for my first airbnb experience. the house was just like in the pictures and the room was even better! they take amazing care of the place and it\\'s serious a treasure. the neighborhood was perfect, in the middle of everything and yet quiet. they were great hosts and made sure we had everything we needed including a stocked fridge and bath/shower necessities. make sure you ask cami for her suggestions of local eateries, she gave us the best thai and burger places all in walking distance! they are seriously great and i plan on staying here every trip to sf from here on out. i couldn\\'t imagine a more peaceful and beautiful room or better guests to stay with. love love love! if you are in sf you have to stay here at least once. they are also totally accommodating, my flight was delayed to 1:30am and then cancelled and they were totally flexible and understanding with waiting for me and then letting me check in late the next day. they are always there if you need anything but also if you\\'re more of the private type they give you your space as well. so easy, so wonderful, i\\'m not sure what else i can say. the best airbnb and the best hosts you could ask for. unbelievable. make sure you take time to explore common areas and a book with the homes history on the coffee table, truly brilliant!!the spencer house deserves each one of its 5 stars and more. it\\'s a magical place and cami is an incredibly friendly and generous host, who goes above and beyond to ensure her guests have a perfect stay. i didn\\'t want to leave!i had a fabulous time at cami and carols and would highly recommend staying there ....... they were the perfect hosts very helpful with any information needed. the house is perfectly situated to get anywhere in the city\\r\\nthe spencer room was very comfortable i found it hard to leave !! i hope to go back one day soon .......amazing hosts, amazing home. walking distance to dining and entertainment in a super cool area of sf, will definitely try to visit again soon!definitely my best experience booking through airbnb! the house, to start, is amazing! i felt like i was going back in history and having a dream. if you want your sf trip to be perfect i wouldn\\'t think twice. not to mention that the house is located in the best area, easy access to everywhere! for those who loves architecture, decoration and want to live the victorian style it would be an exquisite experience to be in a house that. the bedroom is just as described and even better! the bathroom was so tidy that even the toilet seat was brand new. not to mention the amenities and all the care. i\\'d only ask future guests to be respectful to the house and kind as our hosts were so we\\'ll keep having this amazing place opened for us! cami and carol are the best ve found great friends and it is priceless. thank you guys and see you next time!cami & carol are the best hosts ever. they are very kind & helpful and the spencer house is just awesome. i enjoyed my stay very much! that was the most awesome experience . cami and carol were great - friendly and helpful.  wonderful location and of course just gorgeous spenser house, absolutely fabulous !!!! thank you !!  i will definitely be back!!! cami and carol couldn\\'t have been better hosts - they were so incredibly welcoming, friendly and informative and we couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is amazing and so was our room. it was insanely special to get to stay there and we felt very lucky that they choose to share the home via airbnb! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighbourhood is very cool - there\\'s some great shops, cafés and bars to enjoy. now we just need an excuse to come back. spencer  house is even better than it looks, a joy to stay at.  double that up with the excellent welcome from carol and cami and it\\'s the perfect recipe for a san francisco stay.  easy walking distance to bars and shops, even golden gate park.  i stayed in the little queen anne room and it was beautiful. perfect for one.  the only negative is that i had to leave.we loved the spencer house!  our lil\\' queen anne room was just precious.  cami was a very gracious, welcoming host.  we felt right at home.  the house is gorgeous, a very special san francisco gem.  lots of space in the whole house to relax--we even invited over my sister and her baby to visit.  \\r\\nthe room is small, yes, but cozy and clean.  the noise on the street didn\\'t bother us too badly.  there is a bus stop right outside the window, but it didn\\'t keep us up at night.  overall, a lovely stay.  from the minute jeff and i arrived at the spencer house, cami made us feel right at home with her warm personable welcome, great tips for local restaurants and her open, relaxed style. lovely carol was also a huge asset and friendly resource, helping us negotiate our departure on the day of the nike marathon.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe were so impressed with the house - every design detail is considered, grand gorgeous spaces and a sense of humor gently injected in the artworks that line the walls.  a classic victorian of this sort could run the risk of feeling stuffy, but at the spencer house, the relaxed, easy going atmosphere offered a nice contrast to the otherwise traditional environment. we also greatly appreciated the additional elements that were available for the guests - from a dedicated computer and printer which came in very handy for planning our trip with (sensitive contents hidden) maps, to a gigantic kitchen with every gadget imaginable for preparing breakfasts and plenty of coffee & tea.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe absolutely loved our room (lil\\' queen ann) with its amazingly wallpapered ceiling and the tiny but elegant adjoining bathroom. while small, the room was sufficient for the two of us for our stay and provided a nice resting point in our otherwise hectic days.\\r\\n\\r\\nour stay at spencer house was certainly a hi-light of our trip and made our visit to san francisco an elegantly unique, welcoming experience.\\r\\nwhat kind of hosts, what kind of a house! - it is even more than amazing staying at spencer house. this gorgeous viktorian house is breathtaking. and when you add the people that you are able to meet, this place is definitely priceless. be it cami & carol and their team that made my stay easy, unforgettable and perfect from the very beginning or be it one of the various guests that i was able to speak with. this is definitely a place that you don’t want to leave! \\r\\n\\r\\nfrom the very first minute, you feel like at home, because of the amazing hospitality of your hosts who put their hearts and souls in running this house. i really enjoyed my stay and i am definitely coming back, because i made some great new friends! in a nutshell: the place - wonderful! the people themselves - wonderful! try to book it, it is awesome! \\r\\nstaying at the spencer house was one of the most memorable traveling experiences i\\'ve ever had. from the minute they answered our reservation request to the moment we left the house, they gave us so much attention and made us feel very very welcome. once we got in the place, we wore received with a house tour, completed by the place history and a couple of tips about the neighborhood. our room was just amazing (like the entire house): the place looks like a fairy-tale home, a 18th century house amazingly preserved. you\\'ll get the feeling of  staying in a historical place with the comfort of our days. cami, carol and their brother make everything with so much love and attention that it\\'s impossible to don\\'t have a perfect time. they made their best to make us feel home - and we did so. staying with them is not like staying anywhere else; it\\'s like staying at a friends place. wonderful place, wonderful hosts, wonderful experience. can\\'t wait for the next time! thank you again for receiving us! great house! we were welcomed heartily despite a late arrival. cami let us know all the ins and outs and left us to enjoy our long weekend. perfect! very convenient to haight-ashbury, golden gate and easy transit to downtown. what can i say that hasn\\'t already been said. the spencer house is one of san francisco\\'s gems. it\\'s the perfect combination of amazing hosts and unique home. there is so much warmth and hospitality in this house, you\\'ll leave feeling like part of the family. highly recommend staying here!cami is a great host, i felt like at my home. and the whole house looks like a museum/gallery in a very positive sense :) and there are rainbows in the house from stained glass :)spencer house remains our all-time best airbnb experience; we\\'ve now stayed with cami three times and each time it has far surpassed our expectations. the rooms are beautiful, characterful and very clean and the location is perfect, just a few blocks from some of the best restaurants in the city and with great transport links as well. cami is always so gracious and friendly, and perfectly organised, and she really makes her guests feel at home. we are already looking forward to our next visit!this bedroom is well maintained in a wonderful old building, cami and carol were super accommodating, and the two cats that spend most of their time asleep are adorable. i\\'m happy to highly recommend this place; it\\'s easy to get to/from downtown from the muni stop right outside, and it\\'s basically adjacent to two excellent parks. great spot.thank you for the warm welcome and kind hospitality! the vegan snacks were thoughtful and very tasty! really enjoyed staying in your home, it\\'s beautiful. obrigado!hated to leave. can\\'t wait to come back. beautiful accomodations. wonderful hosts.cami was super-friendly on our arrival and throughout the stay, giving us good local advice and ideas on places to visit, eat and drink. the area is great for visiting - close to the centre of town, without being too close, feels safe, but not boring! i don\\'t need to add anything more about the amazing house - quite bizarre, and a fun place to call home for a week.cami went above and beyond to make me feel at home. after a long flight and arriving at night, i was greeted by her smiles, a fantastic bed and nice warm showers. slept like a baby every night and the cats made my morning each morning i left the house. had the opportunity to have dinner + drinks with cami and friends and it was no better way to end my trip in sf. staying with cami and carol was the most amazing sf experience that we could have wished for! the house is indescribable - so many details and cool features. carol was so welcoming and friendly and helpful when we arrived. the room is so cool, and so is the bathroom. nice little details like delicious soap and yummy cookies just added to the overall experience of comfort and cosiness. we really enjoyed our stay!cami and carol are wonderful hosts.  great communication pre arrival.  very welcoming.  the house is very period and beautifully decorated and furnished.  the bed is a bit short for a 6\\' guy but fine if you sleep diagonally!cami and carol were great hosts and were very welcoming! they made me feel right at home and gave excellent recommendations for restaurants and bars in the area. their home is absolutely beautiful and is in a great location. i would absolutely recommend staying here!absolutely stunning house and the best of hosts. this place is truly amazing and one of the most interesting airbnb\\'s i\\'ve ever stayed in. highly recommend staying with cami and carol!our first night at the house, cami and carol hosted and prepared a dinner for all the house\\'s guests. it was a great evening of delicious food and great conversation.cami was very welcoming and showed me around the house when i arrived. the house itself was very breathtaking - absolutely beautiful, like something out of a movie. the pictures show it off some, but it really looks even more intense than that. it\\'s really conveniently located too. and the room my friend and i stayed in was very comfortable. definitely a unique experience !i cannot imagine a better place to stay than the spencer house when visiting san francisco the first time (or any time!).  the house is absolutely gorgeous, it\\'s in a great location, and cami and carol - they are so wonderful and kind.  they made us feel so welcome, i can\\'t imagine ever wanting to stay anywhere else!!  thank you both for making a wonderful vacation that much more awesome.  marco & polo were so precious and always there to greet us, morning or night!  we cannot wait to visit again!we have been stayed in san francisco in the spencer house for a little while. the time was spent there just like our normal daily life. never feels like a tourist. it is more than gorgeous, glamorous and fantastic. it\\'s a magic place to make me feel like i am a part of this place and the city.staying at spencer house was like stay at a movie set :) hands down the most special airbnb experience ever!fantastic house, good atmosphere, easy communication.wonderful as always 3awesome stay. its my second home and cami and carol are awesome hostscami is a really nice master. she is so kind and always have great patient t her guest. the house is clean and beautiful. the position is great,very close to attractionpoints. if i want to back to san francisco,i will choose this house again.i have been traveling airbnb for over three years. i\\'ve stayed in many different spaces across the world. cami and carol provide the type of experience that ever guest hopes for. i literally couldn\\'t sing their praises enough. i am in the process of moving to san francisco, and the spencer house was the perfect home base for the first few weeks.  i wish i could stay forever! the bed was like a cloud, the decor made me feel like i was in a movie, and the hospitality was unparalleled! if you get a chance - please stay here. you won\\'t regret it! that was great! everything just perfect who wants to live in an original victorian house and

stayed in the lil\\' queen - this was the most comfortable bed i\\'ve ever slept in! hope to be back soon :)great place, in the heart of the castro, but still quiet and secure.  wonderful hosts who want to ensure you have a flawless experience.  enjoy the space, and dont forget to take advantage of the grill in huge backyard / garden!our experience with mary and ken’s 14th street home may have been the most wonderful airbnb moment my colleagues and i have had. i’m part of a small production team from los angeles, and due to a sudden location change, we needed a place to stay at a moment’s notice. i sent out feelers for a couple of places, and luckily mary and ken’s were quick to respond to let us know that their place was available. once we arrived at their place, ken showed us the charming house (a slice of history honestly), told us the fascinating story of the place and was very understanding of our situation. all the amenities that were advertised were there, and since we were working on a very tight schedule, the high speed internet was a lifesaver. \\n\\nthough we planned to be as unobtrusive as possible, my colleague accidently managed to do some damage to a water pipe outside. ken and mary had every right to get rid of us that very moment, but their sense of honor and understanding attitude forgave us and let us continue our stay. my colleague told me that sf plumbers were not fast enough to the scene, so ken figured out how to seal the pipe and stop the water from ruining the entire lower level himself! such dedication to being an exceptional host was enlightening and very inspiring.\\n\\nit wasn\\'t until closer to the end of the week we realized how great of a location we were staying at. most of our work meetings were in downtown sf, and we were 10 minutes away from that. with traffic! having such a central location as a headquarters was amazing. to top it off, there were great places to eat just around the corner. \\n\\nwith the parking gate and the extensive security for the house, i felt very safe, which is hard for me whenever i work in a new city. the only regret we have is that we didn’t take the time to truly bask and enjoy everything on our own pace, since the job took a lot of our time. once i return to sf, i’ll definitely try to stay at this place again. it was such a delight!\\ni booked mary and ken\\'s house for a business trip where one of my work colleague and i needed a nice calm place to stay during an entire week. what a pleasure ! first ken showed us the house quickly when we arrived, and we got the chance to meet mary as well a couple of days later. as wonderful hosts, they made us feel immediately at home. what a pleasure to be able to have a great outdoor area - including a bbq !! - right in the middle of san francisco. the beds were real heavens to get some rest after our long days. really enjoyed the proximity with both safeway and whole foods, as well as market st and muni, and close access to us101.\\na big thank you to mary & ken, i\\'m definitely going to keep their house as my primary choice whenever i\\'m back in san francisco ! highly and absolutely recommend :)my workmates and i stayed at mary and ken\\'s place for a few nights while visiting the ciscolive2014 event in san francisco. their house is just as pictured - very spacious and clean. the kitchen had all the amenities we required, and it was really great to have a washer/dryer in the apartment. the wifi worked perfectly and we even had the chance to put some steaks on the grill in the backyard.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, i would highly recommend a stay at mary and ken\\'s place. it was very easy to communicate with and they care about you to have a pleasant stay. e.g. when we had troubles with the alarm systems, ken immediately helped us remotely within minutes.  check-in/check-out was easy.\\r\\nspacious, comfortable home in great location.  easy walk to muni trolley (just 1 block) to downtown, as well as to castro neighborhood stores and restaurants.  very well equipped kitchen. \\r\\n\\r\\nmary and ken were great hosts.  we really appreciated the nice selection of fresh fruit and other treats they left for our arrival. and they responded immediately and with good humor when we had to call them at midnight one night after accidentally setting off the burglar alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe\\'ll definitely keep this one on our wish list for our next visit.\\r\\nwe really enjoyed our second stay at this home.  it’s wonderful to be in a leafy residential neighborhood that’s just a couple of blocks from all of the stores and restaurants of the castro district.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe off-street parking was a definite plus.  a car is not at all necessary for this house, but we were en route to the coast so we needed one.  the one caution is that the driveway is really steep.  we found that even if you go really slowly you might not be able to avoid scraping the bottom of your car on the edge of the sidewalk. a higher-clearance vehicle like an suv should have no problems at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nmary and ken were great hosts.\\r\\nmary and ken were most helpful with anything. we arrived later then expected which was not a problem at all. the house is great and closey located to mary st with loads of restaurants and bars. access to public transport is also super easy. the house itself was perfeclty clean and provided all facilities and stuff needed. all in all a fully recommendable play i would definitely book again for another stay in san francisco. thanks again for everything you two!mary and ken were great hosts and communicative from the beginning.  checking in was easy and when we arrived we found the hose very clean and well stocked with towels, linens, and kitchen basics. we loved using the backyard for bbqing and having parking was a big help.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is spacious with room for everyone who stays there, with a both dining room and separate living room.  we had a great weekend in the city and would recommend this rental!my colleagues found the accomodations to be comfortable and relaxing after long days of work away from home. keep up the good work!most importantly, everything about the house was exactly as described. we were there 11 nights. the accommodation suited our group which comprised 6 people - 4 adults and 2 children. it was a perfect location for castro and the city with public transport close by. secure parking by the side of the house was wonderful. hosts, mary and ken were superb -  responsive during booking and in the run up to our trip. they were also very kind and considerate in helping out with a favor to us - they went way beyond the norm with this and we were grateful. altogether a good experience.a quintessential san francisco house all to yourself in a very central location. the hosts were responsive, helpful and friendly. the house\\'s quirky old-school decor adds to the charm. mary was the perfect host and remained in contact throughout our stay and ensured our arrival went smoothly.  the house was perfect for our needs and in a great neighbourhood.  we\\'d definitely stay here again.ken and mary were very helpful throughout the planning stages and our stay.  ken was there to meet us and walked us through the house.  we were greeted by wine, cheese, salami, and crackers that the host had prepared.  kitchen was very well stocked.  the house was clean, cozy and warm.  the kids thought that it was like living in a little doll house.  the washer and dryer were very big and could accommodate  big load of laundry.  the location is very convenient to transport, restaurants and groceries and we did not need to hire a car.  as with all old houses, the stairs leading up to the 2 bedrooms upstairs is a bit steep and narrow and the bathroom is behind the kitchen so best to leave a light on at night. this house was the perfect retreat for our family over the xmas holidays.  it is precisely as it is described, clean, nicely furnished with parking and lovely back yard. the hosts were very welcoming and reachable. thank you ken and mary.i had 3 employees staying while attending a trade show.\\r\\neveryone enjoyed the home and would stay their again.\\r\\nparking was a great perk for sf.mary and ken did their best! it was a great experience. the location is amazing! the house is wonderful and very cozy. everything we needed mary and ken were there for us. they stayed in touch during our stay they made sure everything was fine. i have no words to describe how beautiful is the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere are plenty of places around to eat, go shopping or for a drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you mary and ken!i booked the house for my c-level colleagues and it fitted their needs perfectly for their business trip to the bay area. clean, nice, great location and a parking lot! all perfect, next time we need a place to stay in sf i will contact mary and ken again. thanks a lot!fabulous stay in beautiful house in central san francisco. we stayed with our 2 sets if parents and highly recommend. great location and house very well equipped. thanks for a great stay :)we cannot recommend mary and ken\\'s place enough! first of all, it\\'s a beautiful home that is well-furnished, spotless, and has more than enough old san francisco charm. the driveway is invaluable if you have a car, as is the backyard (if the weather cooperates). the neighborhood also puts you in reach of great food, shopping, outdoor activities, and even highway connections to the rest of the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut most importantly, mary and ken were easy to reach both before and during our trip. that kind of hospitality for our entire family was well appreciated and makes us already miss the place! you can\\'t go wrong staying here on your next trip to the bay area.my husband and i spent a great 2 weeks in sf and renting mary\\'s house was perfect. \\r\\nmary and ken were helpful at all times (many thanks) although everything was so well organised little input was needed.  \\r\\nthe house was spacious, historically interesting and very clean and comfortable with everything you could wish for provided in a home-from-home atmosphere. \\r\\nwe especially wanted for off street parking for our visit - as we were aware this is at a premium in sf - and this could not have been better with secure easy access as well as enough space in the pleasant back yard to sit out. we have no hesitation in recommending mary and ken and would book the house again for our next visit. we had a good welcome from our hosts with a nice bottle of red wine and some local delicatessen. the house was immaculately clean and as shown in the photos. the kitchen was large and well equipped. the neighbourhood was very nice - close to all the links into downtown, but not too busy in itself. it was handy too having a safeway at walking distance. we had a great visit to this wonderful city and the garden was lovely, as described.mary and ken are perfect hosts. they were accommodating in every way.  when we wanted to check in early, no problem. the wine and cheese was a very nice touch. the house is immaculate and offers more than is advertised.  if you have a car, the private parking is a huge deal.  the location can\\'t be beat.  thanks for all the personal attention. our family of five had a very pleasant time in the house. it is old and simple but charming, very clean, with a very well equipped kitchen and nicely located : castro street is in walking distance, as well as safeway. the parking was very convenient to tour the city by car. ken was nice and responsive. thank you!location, location, location! this house was in the ideal neighborhood for my visit to sf. within walking distance to castro & haight, this house provided a great home base for me and my friends during our trip to outside lands. parking was also a breeze with their private driveway. i had a great time staying here! the well stocked kitchen and large fridge allowed us to make all our meals quite easily. the only thing is that steep stairs and a little bit of a slant in the dining room makes going to the restroom during the night a bit of an adventure. mary and ken were quick to respond to any questions i had, and after initial difficulty getting in, i had an absolutely wonderful time staying at their home.staying at mary\\'s and ken\\'s come was an unforgettable family experience! we stayed with our 2 kids for 5 nights and loved it!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home in the heart of castro and located centrally in the city. locally there was a farmers market, organic grocery store, great restaurants and coffee. it was also easy to get to children\\'s destinations such dolores park, cal academy of sciences and the  exploratorium. a bonus is that it is walking distance to the trolley\\'s which my son loved being a fan of daniel tiger. the booming mission district is nearby with great food, dessert and eclectic shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home itself was perfect for our situation. it was baby proofed with gates and had a crib with a rocking chair. the laundry room downstairs had fairly new appliances and was amply stocked. we needed a car to get around and having a driveway was very helpful.this was the cleanest rental i have ever stayed in; it was immaculate! there were snacks and wine for us when we arrived, which we greatly appreciated after the cross-country flight! great location in easy walking distance to muni and about a million awesome restaurants. the off-street parking is a must, and the private garden was perfect for the kids to run around in. speaking of kids, there is an awesome little park and playground a block away, as well as baby gates for the two staircases. when the driveway gate was acting cuckoo, ken immediately came over and fixed it for us; mary and ken were both really quick to respond whenever we had questions! we really loved our stay and definitely recommend this house and host!donald is an excellent host. he provided a clean place with all the necessary amenities. he is knowledgeable of the sf area and recommended some excellent places to visit. i definitely recommend staying with him!\\r\\nwe really liked this place! the parquet floor in victor\\'s victorian is stunning, as is the view through the beautiful black and white kitchen area onto the back veranda, immediately as you enter the house. victor is a relaxed and generous landlord who is willing to accommodate you to the max! we found that his lifestyle and ours matched perfectly, so that we were able to cook beautifully and dine sumptuously in his lavish dining room ( with 8 people total and 5 every day for breakfast). sunning in the backyard is wonderful (especially because this part of san francisco can be very cool).... as is walking to the farmers market on weekends or canyon market to retrieve groceries. the cup (on your way to the market) has great capuccino. the bart is diagonally across the street. this is a wonderful home! the only caveat is: do not rent this home if you are cat allergic. victor has a cat........(an old gal who is sweet as can be) ...and, fortunately, none of us are allergic to cats. but, the kids ( who grew up without animals at all) were totally freaked out by accidents. we would definitely like to come here again. thank you victor. mike, val, dennis, sasha and patrick.victor is a great host - kind, helpful and responsive.  his beautiful home really enhanced our recent trip to san francisco.  the house has an ideal combination of historic detail and up-to-date amenities - nice linens, spacious interiors, and an amazing kitchen.   sweeping city views from the master bedroom don\\'t hurt, either.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe surrounding neighborhood of glen park has a really appealing independent character (and great independent shops).  victor\\'s home is on a residential street just a few minutes\\' walk from the bart station and several muni bus lines,  and is also very close to glen canyon park, one of the city\\'s largest and most tranquil open spaces.  \\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s a perfect base of operations for any visit to san francisco.victor\\'s place was great, one of the oldest in san francisco actually and amazingly period complete. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is very nice, comfortable, quiet and well furnished. the weather is also spot-on, we turned on the heater in the mornings for a little while, but other than that, it maintained a perfect temperature all day long. \\r\\n\\r\\nvictor was also a great host. very detail oriented and everything was well thought out. very easy to work with.i had a business trip to san francisco with two other colleagues  and stayed three nights at victor\\'s beautiful house. victor is incredibly cool and flexible. he was responsive and communicated with me throughout the whole process and made me feel very comfortable. his house is even more amazing than the pictures. you have to stay there to really understand just how much style this place has.  it is comfortable, clean, classy, and exquisitely designed. the kitchen has everything you need to throw a dinner party. there is a big dining room and an amazing mcintosh sound system! all the bedrooms and beds are cozy and super comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is right next to a bart station so it\\'s very easy to get around san francisco without a car.  i strongly recommend victor\\'s home. i plan to stay there every time i go back, if it\\'s available.the home has great character and is ideally located in the heart of glen park.  the bart station is 1 block away.  plenty of markets, coffee shops, and restaurants are near as well.  we made dinner our first evening and shared some of our laughter with this wonderful old home.  victor is a pleasure.  you can\\'t miss on this if you are interested in a home with history that is just close enough to everything.  try finding a place for four co-workers to stay in sf during the busiest weekend of the year.  enter victor to the rescue! he was a pleasure to work with, super organized and accommodating.  the house is beautiful.  i didn\\'t stay in the house- just coordinated the stay and did a walk-through - but the reports were that it was lovely.  super close to bart, too!my family spent a weekend there just before a wedding and the house exceeded our expectations. the house is large and the living space in it is very versatile- from hanging out or having your friends for dinner - the house dealt with it all! \\r\\nvictor is the best host we could have asked for- he was flexible, accommodating and helpful with anything we needed.  \\r\\nif you need a house in sf, stay in victor\\'s house! great stay. the house is perfect, host is flexible. i would recommend, unconditionally.victor is a extremely easy and accommodating as a host. priced very reasonable.  i highly recommend renting a single room or his entire house. his home is comfortable, organized, clean and impeccably decorated. i would rent again and or suggest it to anyone we know. victor and his cat were very good host.  we spend fantastic time in his house.  we would like to stay again.the house was beautiful as shown in the pictures; little things like the fridge had been carefully cleaned. victor left out a bunch of coffee modules for his nespresso machine, which were greatly appreciated. the bart station is literally four minutes\\' walk from the house, and the glen park neighbourhood is right there with all the shops you could need for a pleasant stay in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\ni can\\'t think of a more optimal four-bedroom place that you could rent in sf for under $500/night that will get you downtown in 18 minutes flat.\\r\\n\\r\\nsmall list of caveats:\\r\\n\\r\\n- one thing that i missed from the description was that the house has just one shower. there were five of us, and the shower rotation was a bit intense each morning. if you have a large group, keep that in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n- victor asked us to take care of his cat. one of our group was allergic to cats, so victor refunded us some of our rental, which we donated to charity.the house is beautiful and very well kept as you can see in the pictures provided.  there were four of us who stayed here for a week and we all enjoyed staying in the house very much.  from the gracious host (victor) that i got to meet on check-in, to the bart station right down the street, to the variety of little shops right \"down town\" glen park there is not a lot you could be wanting for.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni was the early riser of the group and the little sun-nook off the kitchen is a great place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee while the sun comes up and the birds flit about.  well, it doesn\\'t have to be when the sun comes up, as it\\'s still a nice place to sit.  :)\\r\\n\\r\\nyou really feel like you are staying in a piece of history when you are in this house.  we all recommend it highly and we all had a great time staying here.four of us flew in from out of two to stay at victor\\'s for a two week project. victor is awesome and had the place ready for us on short notice. the house itself is absolutely beautiful with a yard, garage, and huge kitchen. the location is great for us, right near the 280 on ramp. you have to stay here if you can!victor\\'s house is absolutely beautiful - what a kitchen!!!!\\r\\ni\\'d had the pleasure of attending a birthday party there so when i was looking for a location for a photo shoot i contacted victor.\\r\\nhe was very communicative and got back to me right away with  answers, even though i had about a thousand questions.\\r\\nthe rooms are very clean and beautifully maintained, not to mention all of the furnishings being beyond beautiful.\\r\\nthe house is in a very residential neighborhood, but is just a few blocks from everything a person could need - coffee, grocery, bookstores etc. and really close to bart and other public transit.\\r\\none note - if you\\'re used to plugging your ipod or phone in for music, bring speakers. there\\'s a wonderful sound system, but it only plays cds.\\r\\ngreat house,perfect for all 6 of us, a comfortable stay, beautiful furnishings and really nice garden for morning tea or coffee.\\r\\nall 6 of us enjoyed the comfort of this wonderful house and it was convenient to all the places we went to in the city; shops, a graduation, dinners and museums.\\r\\nthe neighborhood canyon market was incredible find too.\\r\\nthanks victor for creating such a great ambiance for your guests.\\r\\nwonderfull house, wonderful people. my team had some good days! thanks for that!!!though we didn\\'t get to meet victor in person, he was very responsive and helpful. during the days we visited, sf was a bit foggy and cold, so that we spent more time in the house. i like the neighborhood. everyone of my family was happy about the stay. besides, canyon market offers fresh food and fruit, and we prepared a great dinner, thanks to the well equipped kitchen. victor and his team (the lovely and helpful isabel who cleans and sorts) were incredibly helpful and responsive. victor\\'s house is exquisite and for those of us loving early c20th design it is a work of love and profoundly good taste. next time we will leave the kids at home until they grow out of that exploratory \\'touch everything\\' stage and the garden matches the interior. for cooks, you will want to pack every item of victor\\'s kitchen in your luggage. this man has seriously good taste! great house! the kitchen is well equipped:) victor was very helpful and replied to questions right away. thanks victor!victor\\'s house is absolutely beautiful!  it\\'s a victorian-era row house on a hill in a lovely neighborhood in sf.   i stayed here with a group of five people, and it was perfect for us.  there were some issues with the health of the elderly cat during our stay, which we alerted victor to and he dealt with.  we would certainly stay here again.  \\r\\nbe aware there is only one full bathroom with shower in the house.  it wasn\\'t a problem for us, but it might be an issue for a large group if time is an issue.  victor wasn\\'t there in person, but he was very responsive via text and email to all our needs.  beautiful home -- highly recommended, with above caveat about shower.this is an awesome house in a great location, with a gorgeous cat and very flexible and willing host (victor).  i recommend it to anyone!great city. we\\'ve stayed in this amazing victorian house. victor was the best. always available. thanks to him we spent a week in a san francisco typic way.victor\\'s place was amazing! so much light, so much beauty. we enjoyed having a long brunch around the long dinner-table, cooked in the fully-equipped kitchen and followed by mimosas in the garden. listening to the amazing sound system was an added bonus, as was the very sweet kitten.victor was a great host. we got into a bit of pickle and had our housing fall through at last minute and he was able to accommodate our slightly frantic request with ease. the house is ridiculous in the good way. amazing architecture, yard, kitchen... it\\'s just wonderful. absolutely loved our stay at victor\\'s house. first of all, glen park is a hidden gem of a neighborhood with one of the best natural food markets i\\'ve ever been to in my life, some great restaurants and cafes, and easy access to public transportation or to the freeways for getting around. secondly, the house itself is a total gem that is quintessential san francisco. from the gorgeously renovated kitchen and the antique furniture to the comfortable beds and the clawfoot tub, everything was so full of character and added so much to our experience. the sweet elderly cat was a lovebug. victor was great to communicate with and explained everything perfectly. i can\\'t wait to come back.victor was a fantastic, welcoming and flexible host, offering great local restaurant recommendations, and the house was ideal for a group traveling together. the bart station nearby is great for getting around the city and the house itself is beautiful - a great experience all round, would highly recommend!victor\\'s home was beautiful and in perfect condition.  the kitchen had every appliance that you would want - including a great blender for our morning smoothies.  we even were able to do our workouts using the cd player.  who has a marantz sound system today?  incredible!!!  and to top it off, we are cat people and my wife and daughter loved playing with his cat as well.  if it is available, grab it!!!  we sure will next time we come back to sf.  \\r\\nvictor was also very communicative prior to and throughout our visit.\\r\\nvictor offered us an ideal home during our stay at sf. wonderful experience. would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting sf.victor was very easy to communicate with and responsive whenever i had a question. beautiful house, wonderful host! my mom and i had a great time -- thanks victor for sharing your home with us. beautiful, high end home.  good location.  garage parking. perfect for our family of four.  victor was really easy to work with.  excellent and prompt communication.  there was even a nice old kitty to make us feel at home.  highly recommended.we very enjoyed our stay in victor\\'s house, will definitely recommend to our friend if they plan to visit sfthis house is simply beautiful. a light, wide open and well stocked kitchen opens to the backyard. every piece of furniture is gorgeous. in short, the place looks exactly the way the photos depict it. it is a comfortable and easy space to live in. throw in a great little area of restaurants and markets a couple of blocks away and a bart station only a block away, and this place was perfect for our family. we\\'re coming back through sf next week and if this place is available (and we hope it is!) we\\'re staying here again! we stayed here earlier in the month and liked it so so much, we asked victor if we could come back - and thankfully the house was available. the house itself is exquisite and the furnishings beautiful, but what really makes it for us is how comfortable it is. the stocked kitchen, the comfy bedrooms, and an intimate local neighborhood with friendly people and good food made us wish we could have stayed all month. it has become a home away from home. and our host victor is so friendly and so easy communicate with, he came to feel like a brother of a different mother. thanks so much!!!our group loved our stay at victor\\'s gorgeous home.  it\\'s an older home but was not lacking in any amenities and was very \"san francisco.\"  victor was very easy to communicate with and was a thoughtful host.  beds were very comfortable and the water pressure great.beautiful home and location. victor was always quick to respond to any and all questions, no matter how small.  he followed up regularly and provided clear instructions for the property.great house and fun time with a cat. very conveniently located for both bart and free way.our stay was great. victor responds very fast, and ready to help with any problem. property is nice too!victor is a wonderful host. he is reliable, flexible, and very helpful. i highly recommend to stay his beautiful and comfortable property in a perfect location. thank you victor for your amazing hospitality:) wonderful house in a great part of sf, which i didn\\'t know before staying at victor\\'s - loved it and hope to be able to come back soon :-) thx! best choice with group ppl or family living in sf. it\\'s quite over my expectation. my family love the house and don\\'t wanna leave :( victor is a nice guy and we like his house decoration and hifi stereo system. highly recommend if you want to stay like a home.we did not have chance to meet with victor, but thru the text communications he seems an honest, flexible, true and down to earth person, also a thinker i guess! house is wonderful - the color, layout, decorations all blended together to make it a very enjoyable home! \\r\\nthere\\'re actually 4 beds upstairs, two are the real beds and super comfortable, the other two are nice but if you are tall, your feet may not fit. but it won\\'t stop us choosing this place again, we all love victor\\'s place! victor has a beautiful,welcoming home in a great location.   i had a team in town for a conference and it worked out perfectly for us.what a wonderful home. we really enjoyed ourselves. the house had an amazing  victorian charm with modern twist. the kitchen is gorgeous and had everything we needed for a great thanksgiving dinner. the back yard is amazing for eating and relaxing.\\r\\nthe beds are very comfortable. the water pressure in the shower is great.\\r\\nthe neighborhood is safe, quiet with plenty of parking. the town was waking distant away with some great restaurants. \\r\\nthe owner, victor was amazing. he really is gracious and takes the time to check on you during your stay. \\r\\nwe will for sure be back. i just can\\'t say enough on how beautiful and spacious this home is. we searched for two months for a place to stay in sf. when we finally found victor\\'s place through airbnb (our first experience), and inquired, he responded immediately. during the whole process he was very communicative, which we really appreciated. his home was just as advertised,  a very lovely authentic san francisco experience in an undiscovered gem of a neighborhood. we had    fantastic dinners in the local italian, french and shanghai dumpling restaurants and absolutely loved the neighborhood gourmet grocery store for prepared food for dinner at the home with it\\'s lovely dining room. while the home is not in the center of the city, we found that uber (another first experience for us and highly recommend in sf)  took us where we needed to go very efficiently within a very reasonable period of time. victor provided excellent instructions on the home \\r\\n( the shower is a trip!) which we very much appreciated. we really enjoyed the fully equipped kitchen and large dining room. after  our days of adventuring in and around sf, it was such a pleasure to arrive back at victor\\'s warm yet elegant home for an evening of relaxing. \\r\\nvery welcomy ! \\r\\nleft us a booklet with : \\r\\n- the restaurants, grocery stores around… \\r\\n- how to get to downtown (a few minutes in bart), etc…\\r\\n- how to feel at home in the house\\r\\n\\r\\nvery much appreciated !\\r\\ni stayed in victor\\'s place for 11 days with another 2 colleges & it was absolute perfect: clean, well equipped, a lot of privacy, lovely neighbourhood.\\r\\nthe bart is only 5 minutes walkbeautiful home, great historic charm. perfect location as well, right next to a few small shops and restaurants, and a short walk to the bart to get to the city center. victor was also very quick to respond to any questions and provided some good notes on how to use the alarm, showers, etc. along with a few good recommendations for dinner and drinks.everything is perfect as listed. very nice and convenient neighborhood. we could not meet victor but the cleaning lady, isabella who helped us to figure out what is where and what to do when. victor had already sent us the house rules before we came but having someone explaining what was written in the rules (it was a long list by the way but we understood it was needed :)) helped us to feel better. although we could not meet in person, victor was always there when we needed help - no wonder why he has the super-host badge!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was good but there were some moments where we had problems:\\r\\n1 - we could not arm the alarm on the first day. it took us quite some time to understand that we had to make sure every door / window was closed to arm it (including the main door.) \\r\\n2 - there were cameras over-looking into the main entrance and the entrance in the back of the house. we did not know if we needed to unplug them or not.\\r\\n3 - there are 4 bedrooms in the house but one of them is really really small. you\\'ll find music instruments (which needs cleaning) occupying majority of the space there. \\r\\n4 - the neighbors are really sensitive. just after we entered to the house, we were welcomed with the neighbor who lived in the next house. we were told to take off our shoes as it would be noisy for her to walk with them. (although we would have done that already to keep the house clean anyway.)\\r\\n\\r\\nhouse is big, you can find anything you need to prepare food / drink. it is close to bart station; 5 mins away from grocery / coffee shops located in the center of glen park. \\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, we had good time - it just took some time in the beginning of our stay to adapt. thanks victor for opening up your home to us. we had a great stay. the home was just like the description and suited our needs perfectly. we all had our own space, and it felt homely rather than staying in a random hotel which was great for our business needs and after hours collaborations. victor is an awesome host! his place is beautiful and convenient to bart.  i\\'d definitely stay there again!we had a great time in san francisco thanks to victor and the grand 1800 victorian. after arriving in san fran to find an issue with the unit we had originally booked through airbnb, victor was able to accommodate us very last minute and was very helpful in getting everything sorted. the house is very nice with a great kitchen and backyard patio. it is also very conveniently located to get into center city, only a few blocks from the bart.  victor really bailed us out and it was very much appreciated we (4 of us) felt lucky to have found victor\\'s grand 1880\\'s victorian in san francisco. everything was as described or, in some cases better (pictures are beautiful, but do not do justice to the size of the place and all the fine details). the house is massive with plenty of space for everyone to hang out or relax on their own. the location in glen park was ideal for downtown as well as sfo, palo alto, san jose. victor\\'s house guide (with detailed instructions and expert recommendations) was the key to making our entire stay seamless and successful. absolutely, we look forward to staying here, again.the house is beautiful and the host is very easy to contact, my family had a great time there.excellent location. house was even prettier than the pictures. victor was a terrific host and easy to work with. i\\'ll be reserving this place again.the host was attentive, prompt with response, and when we arrived he checked on us to make sure we got in okay and that we were enjoying our stay. the house was clean, there were plenty of linens, and the kitchen was nice and big and well stocked with cooking equipment for preparing meals. excellent location near a train station and a garage for the rental car made transportation convenient. the expectations for how to take care of the home during our stay were also very clearly laid out for us. great place to stay near down town!  it was very quiet and very spacious!  lots of character.  we had a great stay thanks!house is even more beautiful than the photographs suggest.  perfectly decorated and spotlessly clean.  very convenient to bart and we found we enjoyed the local neighbourhood  as well.  host was incredibly well organized and helpful.victor was a brilliant host - the instructions and entry were super simple and easy. victor sent us a great guide to the house and san fran, recommending various restos and spots to check out. apart from that he left us completely to our own devices but was very approachable in case we needed any extra help.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house itself is stunning, 4 very spacious bedrooms (2 singles, 2 doubles) and a brilliant kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d definitely recommend staying here if you\\'re in sf and need somewhere equidistant from the hustle and bustle of down town / the relaxed feel of ocean beachwe had a terrific time. the san fran style house is beautiful and spacious. it even comes with a hummingbird in the backyard!!! and it\\'s just 3min.walk to bart , coffee shops, resturants, and supermarket. the owner is very helpful and friendly. got to be on my a list.victor\\'s house is a beautiful victorian san franciscan house. it is spacious and comfortable with lots of character. the backyard is great for hanging out, especially when the sun is out. we had a great time!if you are looking for a very special place to stay in san francisco, you cannot go wrong with this elegant and wonderfully decorated home. what you see in the airbnb listing is what you get! no exaggeration here! if you enjoy classic old and beautifully-done architecture and hardwood floors with a big kitchen and dining room, this is the place for you! a little bit of old world charm, a little bit of funky old san francisco and a whole lot of class! my husband and i cannot rave enough about how wonderful this terrific home was to stay in over the christmas holiday! is it worth the price? we certainly think so! my husband also says that the stereo system alone is worth the price of admission! the quaint old garden for sitting in the sun and relaxing was one of our favorite parts! the owner could not have been more communicative and wonderful to deal with! the instructions that come along with the house are easy to follow and as long as you take good care of the antique furniture, which is beautiful, you will have no problems! hopefully, if we find ourselves in the glen park area again, this will be our home away from home!it was lovely to stay at victors house, we where traveling with a 6 months old baby and our concern was to stay in a hotel and not get the kitchen to heat up baby food, bottles etc... but this house was fully equipped and we loved it so much. the area is also pretty nice, and the nearest food market was excellent. the house was wonderful, and victor was extremely easy to work with.  i would recommend this without any hesitations.victor is a perfect host. everything was well organized and we didn\\'t miss anything.victor was a very kind and gracious host. the home is beautiful and very convenient to public transportation, and there are also several good places to eat nearby. i would recommend this home to anyone looking for a quiet stay in san francisco.everything in the house was clean and great!victor was very communicative and we were able to get into the house without issue. we had no problems with the house and were delighted with all of the details (the floors are amazing) and the nearby amenities, like canyon market. victor was easy to message, which put us at ease about having a great accommodation for our vacation. my family and i had a great stay at victor\\'s victorian in glen park.  the house is spacious and clean and victor provided us with detailed instructions of all the in\\'s and out\\'s of his home.  the beds were comfortable, the kitchen great to cook in, and dining room seats 10!

it was a little further from downtown than we had anticipated but it was really easy to get to and from with the excellent transport links (bus literally around the corner and bart an easy 7 mins walk away). we loved the local feel of the place and enjoyed visiting st. mary\\'s park with the girls and glen park. it\\'s a brilliant local area and it felt safe. the place was well stocked with everything one would need for a comfortable stay. a helpful recommendation on local places was in the apartment and check in and out was easy and flexible which was great - a real bonus when travelling with young ones! i also liked the wifi password - matt has exceptional musical taste! \\nadditional touches which were really appreciated was the iphone charges available in the kitchen and bedroom. sinple and thoughtful touches that make a big difference. thank you! \\na fantastic apartment and host - i thoroughly recommend this apartment. thanks so much matt for contributing to an excellent local experience of san fran. the apartment was just as advertised and the host was very prompt in replying to any questions. this place was fantastic!   it\\'s a full floor of an old victorian in the southwest corner of hip bernal heights.  the apartment gets wonderful natural light, helped by the high ceilings and clean, modern renovation.  there are orange and lemon trees growing in the yard, and herbs on the front walk. matt very thoughtfully provided a neighborhood guide, which we used to explore the immediate neighborhood as well as adjoining glen park, which is only about a 10 minute walk away.  his recommendations were great - we especially enjoyed shopping at canyon market!\\n\\nbottom line: the apartment was clean, well-appointed, and more than large enough for my group of four.  a wonderful home base for anyone looking to explore sf or just to enjoy the immediate area!my stay at matt\\'s place was awesome. one of the best trips i\\'ve had to san francisco to date. the place was very clean and open with a great layout. i was in the bay area on two weeks of work prior to arrival and was so happy to be able to do laundry, cook, and get a couple of days to relax there before the last week of my work trip. it had everything needed to make you feel at home while out of town (e.g., wifi, apple tv, washer/dryer, comfortable seating areas, full kitchen).  there were no issues checking in or out and he was responsive to all of my messages leading up to the stay. i couldn\\'t ask for more. i really appreciate him offering up his space and would definitely recommend. thank you, matt!excellent host, very accomidatingbenjamin\\'s home is absolutely amazing and we had a wonderful stay. checking in and checking out was a breeze and the house is situated in the notoriously charming noe valley neighborhood. parking was easy to find and there are tons of great restaurants within walking distance. the flat is amazing as is benjamin!

 by the end we felt like we were pretty good friends with ben, i don\\'t think that happens very often but our schedules matched up just right on sunday and we had some great conversations.  ben is a very helpful host. the view is incredible. the bathtub is great.  no complaints. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was our first time with airbnb so it took a bit to get used to being in a house instead of a hotel, but it has a lot of parts that are far better than a hotel. a great host and a sensational view!i had an awesome time at ben\\'s flat! the bed was comfortable, the bath was perfect, and the views that you get of the city are simply unbeatable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location rocked too-- it\\'s only one block from public transit and a couple blocks from 24th street (for great restaurants, shops, and stores).\\r\\n\\r\\ni liked the place so much, i extended my stay by 2 days and signed a lease at a nearby apartment. book this now!what a wonderful place to spend a night in san francisco. the views were incredible and checking in and out was a breeze. it was a great quick getaway.  nice change from being at a loud crowded hotel downtown.  i hope to visit again soon.  gorgeous space and fantastic views!ben was an excellent host.  the house was just as the pictures show--with amazing views and clean, comfortable accommodations.  i had just moved to san francisco for work--and ben has been helpful expert in getting to know the city (where to live, trainers, etc.).  i liked the neighborhood so much i just got an apartment several blocks away.ben was a great host!

booked the flat for a company photoshoot - turned out great. great apartment with amazing views!  everything went smoothly and i would definitely stay again.ben\\'s appartement was truly amazing. i was visiting san francisco for work and decided to try out airbnb instead of a hotel room. i am glad i stumbled upon ben\\'s condo because the work trip turned into almost a vacation trip. everything in his place is meticulous and top-of-the-line, from the designer furniture to the brand of washers and driers to the latest music mix that will play if you turn on the apartment-wide sound system. and the best part of all is the most spectacular views of san francisco i have seen from any other building.amazing apartment.  totally stunning.  incredible views and really nicely kitted out.  ben was away when i stayed but left the keys with his friend who met me on time - no problem.  it\\'s a short walk from the apartment down to the noe valley shops (wholefoods, great bars, bakeries etc) and from there not too far to venture into the mission district or castro.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only recommendation i\\'d make is to bring eye (sleep) masks, as the light comes streaming in to the bedroom in the morning and will wake you up early.  ben may be able to give you a set...\\r\\n\\r\\nrecommended!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfantastic view!

one could easily just stare out the window all day. as my first ever airbnb - it was a killer place to land when we arrived in sf.   \\r\\nthe place was extremely clean, bright and organized. communication with ben was easy and he made us feel very welcome in his home! definitely recommend this place for anyone  who wants a great experience in sf.ben and his partner chris were welcoming and friendly. the private room, bathroom & balcony are all very clean and comfortable - and have the most amazing view of sf. noe valley is filled with restaurants, cafes & little shops, all a five minute walk from their place. no need for a car - everything is walkable or an inexpensive uber ride away.  ben\\'s place is absolutely stunning and located atop a hill in noe valley overlooking most of san francisco. it\\'s the sort of place you feel honored to stay in... ben and chris were both very welcoming and i would highly recommend this location to anyone visiting san fran. i truly enjoyed walking to 24th street each day for coffee, dinner, and a nightcap. beautiful views, modern amenities, and great location! it was very clean and well appointedgreat place — clean, quiet and well-located. the shower was shared with 1 other person only, which was good. the metro/tram is only 3 minutes away and it takes only 15 minutes to get to powell station (city center). the neighbourhood is very safe. i’ve been returning late and haven’t had any issues. \\r\\n\\r\\nyann was super helpful and very welcoming! on my arrival there was a little present waiting for me. it was a pleasant surprise. also, yann gave me a lift to stanford which saved me an hour or so! overall, i have a pleasant impression and would stay there again! recommended!yann was a gracious and helpful host. the space was clean and quiet. would definitely stay there again.staying at yann\\'s place was great. exactly like in the pictures.  he\\'s a very kind and generous host. location is very good, close to parks, not far from beach with many shops/restaurant a short walk away. there is a muni stop about 3minutes away and it takes 20min to go to downtown.  i would definitely stay there again. yann is a good host, he made sure we had anything we needed and that we felt comfortable in the room.\\nthe room is spacious and quite. the bed is a little bit too hard for my personal taste but all in all a good place to stay. \\nupon check out yann was so kind he gave us a ride to the train so we got in time to our appointment. \\nthanks yanni was only visiting san francisco for a couple of days but the lodging was very accommodating. this was my first experience using airbnb and yann did a wonderful job ensuring all my questions were answered in a expedited manner. the room was very comfortable and private. parking was not a problem, especially in san francisco! overall, yann was a awesome host and i plan on staying there again the next time i make it up to the city.the room was large, sunny and cozy. yann was a cool host and very helpful. \\nhis place is walking distance to the best eateries and markets and our stay was very enjoyable. i would highly recommend him.san francisco is the neatest city and yann\\'s place was a great base camp for exploring!this was my first airbnb experience and i have to admit it was surprisingly positive. i really appreciated the instant book feature, and yann was very accommodating and helpful throughout my stay. he maintains a nice, large house in a quiet and safe neighborhood with easy off-street parking, quick access to multiple public transit options, and close proximity to ocean beach for relaxing, people watching and walking/running/biking. check-in and check-out was super easy like a hotel, but it was nice to live like a san franciscan instead of being  downtown like a typical tourist. and the french bakery a couple blocks away has delicious fresh baked, toasted baguette with butter and jam. what a nice way to start the day -- with or without the sf fog rolling in.the room is sunny, clean and comfortable!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host yann made us feel very welcome, advising us about where to go for our first time in sf. i was impressed with how everything with the room was carefully thought out. coffee machine, water kettle with teabags, a vacuum cleaner. in the bathroom, in case we forgot anything shampoo, conditioner, body wash, band aids, painkillers so on and so forth. it\\'s much more preferable than staying in a hotel because of the thought that went into making a guest feel comfortable, overall creating an atmosphere that was like staying with friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis place is in a good location, very easy to travel around the city, but more importantly quiet at night, with friendly people. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis was our first trip using air bnb and because of yann\\'s hospitality, we are keen to try it again. enjoyed the stay immensely, yann was very helpful, and very good with instant replies to queries. directions to the flat were excellent and his book of san fransisco walls that he lends out was invaluable. i left the car on his driveway and took uber cabs around the city at his suggestion which worked really well. \\ncan recommend wholeheartedly   yann was a very welcoming and understanding host. he worked with me whenever i needed anything, and was extremely helpful. i couldn\\'t have felt more at home! the room was spacious, beautiful, and relaxing. the neighborhood is fantastic, with cafes just a block or two away.yann is a very kind host.  the place is clean and quiet and perfect for me.  it was a great value.  i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.  it met my needs very well.as we were on different schedules we did not get to meet yann or any of his (sensitive contents hidden) but he did communicate promptly about the arrangements.  we were disappointed with the room.  it did not feel as though it had been cleaned, there was hair in the bath and the waste baskets had not been emptied.  the kitchen was out of bounds until 9.00 am for fear of waking the house and the walls were thin enough to make this a possibility. this is student living. having said that it is conveniently located for the west portal which is a neat neighbourhood.  it did not work for us.yann, is a very nice guy with a big smile. he was very welcoming. he let us be when wanted but always offered advice if needed. we are pretty self sufficient travellers, so didn’t need much but it was nice to know there was someone there if so. very convenient for public transport, safe neighbourhood, clean + comfortable...what more could you ask for! good for friends (if your cool like we were to share a bed) or a couple traveling but if i travel again to sf especially by myself i would try to book as it is nice if schedules allow to know you can have a quick chat in the evening to someone.yann was a great host. he provided quick responses to inquiries and insights on what to do during our stay.the house was easy to find a key box with a combination was given to me to get access to the house what it made easy .\\r\\nthe listing was accurate and the neigorhood was nice and safe    \\r\\nhouse is clean and in a quiet neighborhood. bath and room on top floor. roommates are decent. several restaurants and a bakery are nearby, also a muni station with direct connection to embarcadero. i would go there again. yann was a really helpful and friendly host and was very quick with the responses to our mails. we walked into downtown in the morning, taking in the neighbourhoods along the way, and got an uber back that night. the room was perfect; clean, big, with a comfortable bed and a nice private bathroom too. there was parking in the driveway just outside the front door for our car. everything just as described. to be recommended. thanks for hosting us yann!great place, decent location, friendly host. room was a little dusty but very clean otherwise. place is two blocks from the l train that goes straight downtown sf. lots of good chinese places on taraval near the l.good room friendly house mates grate location ! very help full yann is good boy. he explained us all relevant issues regarding the haus and room, advised us how to go to downtown and answered us all our questions in interesting way. room was clean, there were prepared books and booklets about sf too. we feel like at home and by next visit of sf we like to stay here again.good location. great privacy. very informative host. would visit sf again!yann was very friendly and made the effort to say \\'hi\\' though we were out till late most days. the room is nice and clean (like in the pictures), having a bathroom to ourselves is a big plus. \\r\\nthe street the apartment is on is nice and quiet, conducive to a good night\\'s rest. thanks yann!our stay with yann was great. the house was nice and quiet, and the free parking was really helpful. the only downside was that there didn\\'t seem to be too much to do within walking distance. if you have a car though, this isn\\'t a problem at all. to start off, check in was very easy and flexible. yan was quick to respond to me. the room/ bathroom was clean and as described. the location was good, i did have a car though. i did not run into the owner or roommates but overall transaction was smooth, including check out. the private bathroom was a plus! never got the privilege of meeting yann, but he was great with communication to make sure everything was set for my stay. we were staying at yann\\'s 3rd floor bedroom with private bathroom next to it.\\r\\nthe house is located very conveniently, in close proximity to the next metro station which takes you downtown (20min) and to the beach (10min).\\r\\nthe room itself and the private bathroom next to it were clean and well equipped. we weren\\'t missing anything.\\r\\nyann, as a host, was very helpful when we had questions what he would recommend for sightseeing and going out in san francisco.\\r\\nall in all we had a very pleasant stay.great host very attentive and went out of his way to make me feel comfortable. as good as described. confortable and clean room and bathroom. parking spot as a decision point. not close to main sf attractions, but two blocks from a metro stop. \\r\\nyann was very friendly and helpful with instructions to get the keys and check in.\\r\\nyann also let a cupon discount which safed me 10 dollars on the rental bike.\\r\\nwe had an amazing time in sanfran. the house was close to transport links maybe 5mins walk with easy access to the touristy spots. we like it being a bit more of a residential area with some good local breakfast places. the room was clean and we even had towels laid out for us and a great walking tour guide book. fantastic trip i am so thankful for yann\\'s hospitality. though i never had the good fortune of meeting him in-person, i received perfect accommodations.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst off, it was fantastic that i could book his room the same day. i was traveling back to the bay area and too exhausted to drive in rush hour a couple of hours home. during my flight i checked airbnb and found yann\\'s listing. thanks to the instant booking and same day reservations, i was able to get in.\\r\\n\\r\\nnext, yann was an excellent communicator and had detailed instructions so that i could easily access the unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nonce i arrived, the room and bathroom were very clean. both rooms had locks (which wasn\\'t the case at another property i had recently visited). there were also two towels available for me in addition to liquid body wash in the bathroom. everything was just as pictured. it was also very quiet and i was able to sleep comfortably and soundly.\\r\\n\\r\\neverything was perfect, except i didn\\'t get to meet yann. hopefully next time as i will definitely keep his property in mind for the future!yann was a great host and very helpful with tips on what to do and where to go in sf. the place was clean and spacious and we had private use to the bathroom next to our room. great location, quiet, near food and public transport. we had our own parking lot for our rental car which was helpful. \\nwe had to carry our luggage up and down two flights of stairs (so take note for anyone with heavy luggage, but this is common in the city). thanks yann for a wonderful stay!yann is very kind and helpful!the room is clean and roomate is very nice. although we meet some problem finding the house,we had a very good night there.we stayed just for one night at yann\\'s place and had a pleasant overall experience. the room is very comfortable and yann has figuered out  an easy way to check in and out.we had a good stay. the room and bathroom were clean. we were not able to interact with yann a lot due to our busy schedule but he was very prompt with responding to our inquiries.yann was a great host! he replied to our communications quickly, he was friendly and answered any questions we had. the room was exactly like in the picture, it was clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable.  when we arrived, we found information books, maps, snacks, wine and beer in our room.  there was a lock on the door but we felt very safe. the house is very quiet, we felt like we were the only ones there most of the times! it was easy and convenient to take transit, two blocks away from the house and the bus took us right to golden gate bridge and to the wharf! we would stay at yann\\'s again.the listing was pretty accurate. it was about two blocks from the muni l-line, which made it quite convenient. also, walking distance to a safeway, walgreens, and numerous eating establishments. the room was adequate. shoes had to be left at the doorway, which is the way it is in many listings. however, my socks got very dirty from the floors. you could not go barefoot in the room because your feet tended to stick to the floor. there was also a funky odor in the bedroom. the private bath was used by another guest on at least one occasion. i did not feel very welcome in the home. i chose this particular listing because they had a tv in the living room and a frig in the kitchen. i was not shown either of these locations and did not feel welcome when i ventured downstairs. the place was clean, and the pictures well represented the place. the communication that was already in place was good (directions to access keys, how to get to the room, wifi, tricks for the shower). however, yann was not responsive at all when i inquired about a few things. i couldn\\'t reach him via neither airbnb nor cellphone number. very frustrating. additionally, it is very difficult to find the house itself at night. the house numbers are not prominently displayed. as a host, yann is incredible! he is very helpful and responds quickly to requests. the room is very nice and ample. the bathroom is fantastic. we had a great time!pretty good! private and silentvery nice room. very nice host.\\nit was very clean .\\ni would recommend staying here.he was very flexible with check in time because i was getting my oil change. before heading to san francisco, but i made it for his set check in time anyways. the house was clean and so was the bathroom. i love how it was close to the beach and 21 mins away from japantown. i had a wonderful stay with my friend because the bed was really spacious. i would stay there one more time again when i go to san francisco.i needed a place to stay just for me for one night in san francisco and this was perfect. his instructions were clear and because my stay was short, our paths never crossed but because of good communication, i never had any questions. it was quiet, safe and easy. i would stay there again. i hadn\\'t been to sf since 1989 and so i had no idea where to stay in the city, but i knew i wanted to be near transit.  yann\\'s place was and there were lots of places to shop and eat nearby. downtown is around 15 minutes by muni (light rail).  the room was on the top floor of the house and very big and comfortable.  the clean washroom is also right  next door.  everyone in the house was super-nice and it seems like they all work in tech in the bay area.  this was a five-star stay!

one of my favorite air bnb places. the place is just like the pictures. i enjoyed his spot so much i almost didn\\'t want to see the city. alex was a great host, i was happy to be there. the apartment was clean and spacious. it\\'s very good located and it was only a short drive to downtown san francisco. \\ni would definitely stay there again!\\nthank you alexour stay in alex\\'s apartment was great and i am afraid it spoiled me for years to come. it\\'s not in the centre of sf, but the apartment makes up for it. it\\'s clean and quiet, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom is very fancy (the bath is huge!), the parking is convenient, and alex is a super nice guy as well as very responsive and flexible. this was my second stay with alex and it was just as awesome as the first! great host! great place! close to the city. five star rating! will def recommend others to stay here. jessica was a pleasure to work with. i got responses to my inquiries very quickly--usually within an hour, which was refreshing! her follow through  made planning our meeting much easier. the place itself is very nice, clean, with open spaces and high ceilings, and is conveniently located. jessica\\'s place was everything i hoped it would be and more. the place is as amazing as the pictures and she was lovely to deal with. i couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.\\r\\n\\r\\n5 star experience all the way. looking forward to staying there again :)my colleague and i absolutely enjoyed our stay at jessica\\'s loft. whether you\\'re in town for a conference at moscone, checking out yerba buena gardens, or exploring some of san francisco\\'s emerging neighborhoods, the location can\\'t be beat. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft was equipped with all of the amenities we could expect and more.  exceptionally clean, organized, and equipped for any scenario. jessica and her husband made great hosts — always leveraging their california roots to provide tailored recommendations to make the most of your trip.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m already trying to find time to visit san francisco again, and when i do, it\\'ll be at jessica\\'s loft.we came to town for a four person offsite. the loft is in a very central part of town and is super cool. it\\'s an awesome head-clearing space with a great (well stocked) kitchen and bar. plus blue bottle is just a few blocks away.\\r\\n\\r\\njessica provided a whiteboard and a projector which made the stay amazing. i highly recommend this place for anything from an offsite, a casual personal trip.the place was wonderful; clean, convenient and jessica was a great host! she went above and beyond to make our stay great. we used it as a live/work space to launch a new institute and it was perfect for our needs. she even left us some delicious wine :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only thing i will caution for visitors is the location, which is in soma/downtown, because of this there are quite a few homeless people around the area at times. for those who like me, live in sf, it is a normal occurrence not bothersome, but may be for some out of townees not used to an urban environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, two thumbs up!we hosted a business meeting at jessica\\'s loft. it all went very well, it\\'s a nice place where to hold small team work sessions or meetings. we\\'ll use it again. \\r\\nalexher place is absolutely fabulous. so unique and spacious. we hosted a working brainstorm and her white board was essential to a productive day. \\r\\n\\r\\nloved all the little notes and details about where to go in the city. \\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommend. jessica and steve\\'s place is a fantastic spot for executive meetings. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe had 12 entrepreneurs spend the day together at their loft, and the huge whiteboard and projector were perfect for presentations and brainstorming.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft was very spacious.  it was conveniently located just a couple blocks away from the marriott marquis, where we were attending an event.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommend this for anyone who wants a unique and creative environment to hold group business meetings instead of the boring and overpriced hotel meeting rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nsteve made sure we were all set for our meeting, provided great food delivery recommendations, and made some amazing coffee for us as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks jessica and steve for your hospitality!rented this fabulous space from these fabulous people for a few creative sessions and brainstorming sessions for our startup.  it is a great space with a really modern/funky feel.  everyone involved with transaction and details were just really, really good!staying at jessica\\'s stylish, airy and brilliantly located apartment was great. we enjoyed the fabulous music collection, the coffee, the comfort and the space. jessica pays great attention to detail and the whole experience was relaxed and wonderful.we rented the apartment for a week due to business meetings in the neigouring area. it was a great stay and a perfekt apartment for sleeping and having meetings in. there is a projector on the second level and a whiteboard on the bottom. the kitchen is great for kooking. \\r\\nthere is only one bed and the rest is inflatable double and single beds. they were great to sleap on but if you are picky, you should know. \\r\\ni can highly recommend this great apartment!i rented out jessica\\'s loft for a one-day business brainstorming meeting. it was perfect for our needs and we had access to a projector and whiteboard. \\r\\n\\r\\njessica was welcoming and kept us well-informed. she contacted me a few times prior to renting the space to confirm details. \\r\\n\\r\\nsince her loft is so close to our downtown office, we will certainly keep this place in mind for our next off-site meeting!\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again jessica :)we were hosting a meeting of about 20 people & wanted a place that felt professional yet somewhat intimate. we were completely delighted with jessica\\'s place! the space is beautiful with loads of natural light & space to stretch our minds & move around a bit. they also really took care to understand how we would be using the space and had workshop / meeting materials thoughtfully on hand. we will use this loft again and recommend it as well.had a fantastic time at jessica\\'s loft recently for a retreat. jessica was extremely helpful in accomodating our group...even set up a whiteboard and projector for brainstorming! would definitely stay again.myself and two business partners rented jessica\\'s loft during apple\\'s wwdc conference. it was wonderful! it provided plenty of space for us to stay and for us to collaborate on work projects throughout the week. i highly recommend it and would try to rent it again the next time we are in the area.we had a lovely stay here. the location is great and the place is big.great location, perfect stay! jessica and her loft are lovely! it\\'s a big and beautiful place to stay for business or for fun. and jessica was cool, sweet and available. great time there!jessica was incredibly responsive and the place was in a perfect location for our business trip to sf. great space to relax and yet get things done while in the city.i booked this place for a business trip for some friends of mine. jessica was super responsive and we got booked immediately and at very last minute! the loft...amazing! such a great place to stay! thank you jessica for the stay! :)really cool classy place. if you are thinking about booking it you should! great loft apartment with packs of character. unusual to find such fabulous internal space in the city. great location only a ten minute walk from union square, with plenty of good restaurants in the vicinity. we used jessica\\'s loft space for an executive offsite earlier this month and had no problems with booking and/or setting up for the day. she was very accommodating throughout the whole process. we were able to do a walkthrough the day before and thanks to her flexibility were able to setup early the morning of the offsite. the loft itself is stunning and cozy. very well kept and centrally located. we definitely recommend this space!tell others in the airbnb community about your stay.jessica\\'s loft was great and just as advertised.  communications with her were easy and efficient.  definitely a welcome change from staying in overpriced and overbooked sf hotels and perfect for hosting a offsite for some new business partners.  made us feel like instant soma insiders..my wife and i had a night out without the kids in the city, and the house was perfect. jessica was very helpful throughout the process. would definitely recommend staying here.we had an amazing time at jessica\\'s loft! i rented her place for a quick scene in a video i was producing, and couldn\\'t have had a smoother experience. she was extremely responsive during the booking process, and went out of her way to accomodate a half day booking. \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we arrived, jessica was super friendly. she gave us a great tour of the loft, which is filled with unique art pieces, and made sure we had everything we needed. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely recommend jessica and her incredible place to anyone who is looking for a premier loft experience in san francisco!great loft with amazing location! everything was clean modern. host, neighbors and property managers were truly great. neighbor even invited us to a party at their think-tank next door, monkeywrench. really a great experience staying here. jessica and her husband were so lovely to work with!  they were both very accommodating and responsive, and my team absolutely loved their awesome loft space.  their home is cozy, open, enormous, creative, and really fun.  we would gladly return in a heartbeat.  we traveled from argentina for business with 2 coworkers and stayed at the loft for 16 days. we were received by jessica on our arrival, and later she gave us a 5\\' tour and left, not before telling us that she was flying to china the next week, so she had billy\\'s (her neighbor) phone number written in the fridge for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nupon arrival, i asked jessica where the projector (listed in the amenities) was and she told me they didn\\'t have and if needed it was brought upon request (not listed like that when we booked) so i requested it (argentinians trying to watch the world cup).\\r\\n\\r\\nnext day i was having some jet lag so i contacted her again, this time for the first aid kit (listed in the amenities) and she told me there was no kit, so she offered to leave some ibuprofen and plasters, which she later did.\\r\\n\\r\\nfour days after arrival, she messaged me that the projector had arrived and she could pass by and drop it at the loft, which she did too.\\r\\n\\r\\nlate that day she messaged me saying that when she was at the loft she saw white dog hair over the sheets and told us that we knew the rules and no pets were allowed, which was fine because we didn\\'t bring animals with us, and there were no animals in the loft at any time.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i told her that, she inquired again about the \"white dog\" which never existed, and we told he again that it wasn\\'t possible, that continued for a couple more messages.\\r\\n\\r\\nat that point we were very uncomfortable with the situation, and begun looking for other places to move, so we told her that if she didn\\'t trust us or felt uncomfortable with us being there, we could move next day, because we have never had a problem before. after that, she settled and we didn\\'t receive more on that subject. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe later discovered that what she said was white dog hair, were actually white fibers from the bedcover.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe last day, as jessica was in china, we called billy to come over and see the place, so we could rest assured that we left it the same way we acquired it, so we met him and everything was ok.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is sad to say, but the place was also listed with amenities that were not there at all, for instance: \\r\\n. pool (there is non, or we didn\\'t have access to one)\\r\\n. whiteboard (not listed \"upon request\")\\r\\n. first aid kit\\r\\n. open bar (which was a wooden box with some old bottles actually)\\r\\n. beer (2 non alcoholic beers)\\r\\n. projector (was brought 4 days later upon request, not listed \"upon request\")\\r\\n. no change of sheet for the only bed there (also requested... just for the mattresses)\\r\\n\\r\\ni loved the wet room, the place was really cool! sadly, the experience was not :(such an awesome space for work or for travel. amazing bathroom with huge bathtub and shower. jessica is a very thoughtful and kind host. would definitely recommend staying here on your trip to sf!the listing was just as expected; creative, modern, and fun. \\r\\njessica was relaxed and gracious in every way. they\\'ve just re-decorated and this is a gem! very central but on a quiet street.the space was great, and met all of our needs.  it\\'s very nicely decorated and set up well for teams to work together or in smaller groups, and the space had everything we needed to get our work done.  there was one minor issue with the projector (due to a previous renter, not the hosts), but jessica & her husband bent over backwards to take care of us.  highly recommended.loft is in a great location amidst all that we needed and when the day was done, easily slept all five of us. the \"shower experience\" truly is an experience, give yourself a few extra minutes to enjoy.summary: overpriced and too loud\\r\\n\\r\\njessica and her husband were friendly when they greeted us and when we gave back the keys. however, the loft didn\\'t meet our expectations. the space is listed as having 6 beds, but it is actually 2 air mattresses, 2 couches (not sleeper sofas), one very hard futon, and one queen size bed. it is also worth noting there are no doors/privacy/bedrooms. even the bathroom door is somewhat see through frosted glass and the sliding bathroom door doesn\\'t lock.\\r\\nlastly, it\\'s a \"mixed use\" neighborhood and the business across the street received loud shipments in the street outside the front door every morning. it was impossible to sleep from 4am-6:30am while they were tossing around boxes and dropping shipping crates on the pavementjessica and steven are very pleasant to work with. they are very quick and responsive in responding to inquiries and requests. when you check in, you get a tour of the beautiful loft and recommendations for entertainment around the area. \\r\\nthe loft is located in a prime area of downtown san francisco and it is very convenient to get around to places. the loft is spacious and very comfortable and our team had a great time.jessica and steven met us personally and showed us the ropes.  the loft was just as described online, and perfect for our stay.  our hosts were very generous and provided access to a commercial-grade kitchen, expresso and nespresso machines and treats in the refrigerator.  we also enjoyed the vinyl album collection of classic records and high quality stereo.   we were also able to use the projector and white board that was provided when clients stopped by.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe suite is clean, unfettered and very tastefully appointed  we rented jessica and steven\\'s place to use as a workspace to launch a new product over a four day period. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a great stay, and the couches, kitchen, and shower were all amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d definitely recommend the space for offsites with teams or for startups looking for a hacker house for a weekend.this loft was amazing! such an amazing space. we had a small group of  clients and friends meet up here to celebrate the launch of our new software product and this place was perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nour guests made comments like, \"how did you find this place?\" they were all very very impressed. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe sound system is cool, but the record collection is even cooler. i would definitely recommend this place to someone looking to plan a business meeting or any event that requires an amazing space.jessica was always quick to reply, and always had answers to even our most specific questions. the space was beautiful and proved to be the perfect work environment for our company offsite.\\r\\n\\r\\nno complaints. had an amazing day. i would recommend this space for business meetings, workshops, formal events, and a true sf experience. there was plenty of space for the ten of us, and could have easily fit more.\\r\\n\\r\\n10/10this was a great spot for a creative team planning offsite. i really appreciated the space, including the whiteboard and projector for sure. i also loved that they had an airport express and speaker system that i could stream music to. wifi was quality. awesome place!we used this loft space for a workshop and it was awesome. very cozy, prone to creative thinking, easy to divide in smaller groups. even the small touches make a difference like the record player or the nespresso machine. the kitchen also makes it very easy to get catering and not crowd the space. i would definitely go back!great!the host was very easy to work with and promptly answered all our questions.  would definitely work with them again!  great space and very welcoming!jessica and steven\\'s loft was just as hip and cool as advertised. very convenient for all the meetings we had around union square. we were able to walk everywhere we needed to go in 10 minutes or less. their friend billy took good care of us as they were out of town. would definitely stay again! thanks guys.the loft and location was great, we loved ability to walk to moscone center, very convenient, team thoroughly enjoyed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only little challenge we faced was with the city streetlight outside main window which made it a challenging to sleep downstairs w/out covering your eyes.my experience was great. kitchen was perfect for preparing breakfast. the layout was overall gorgeous and very social. i had a group of 10 hanging out comfortably. from my son matt: the space was excellent and catered to our every need. it was an amazing experience to bring the executive staff of our organization together to brainstorm and bond as a group. thank you for your hospitality. \\r\\ni like the place a lot, it was close to everything, and i enjoyed my stay.we enjoyed using jessica & steven\\'s amazing loft for our team offsite! it is a unique listing - modern, plenty of space and a variety of great amenities such as a white board, a big table and a projector that made our offsite even more enjoyable. jessica was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. okay, this loft is awesome. the hosts are super friendly and accommodating, they made sure we knew exactly what was around us in regards to entertainment and food. the place is even more beautiful than described. fit our party of 7 perfectly and had more room than we needed. highly recommend! jessica and steven did a very thorough job of welcoming our group. they made sure we knew they were accessible if necessary, but we didn\\'t have any major issues with our overnight stay. there was some overnight noise from a loud party going on next door and some early morning shouting from some homeless person, but that\\'s pretty much expectable on a saturday night in downtown sf. otherwise, the street is very clean and new-looking, and we felt safe walking back at night. they had lots of thoughtful amenities, like extra toothbrushes, a variety of coffee/teas, basic medications, etc. they also provided us with a list of local bars/restaurants/hospitals. the loft is ideally located for easy walking distance to bart, at&t park, and westfield shopping center. we stayed with a group of 6, which was plenty of space. there were plenty of air mattresses/linens for everyone (super-cozy comforters!), and the couches/tempurpedic bed were very comfortable. the high loft ceilings can make the space a bit echo-y, but the trendy vibe is great. everyone in our party raved about the huge bathtub and shower.  the highlight for me was the excellent collection of vinyl records! would definitely stay here again.jessica and steve were awesome.  the place was as described and their hospitality was top notch.  the location in soma was perfect for our needs and was close to everything we needed to accomplish in san francisco.  when i come back i would love it if they would host me again.great space, great communication! perfect for our small team offsite.jessica and steven were super welcome, and the place is amazing. perfect spot for our team\\'s all-day offsite. really comfortable, adaptable, and well equipped. great location. highly recommended.the location was great - easy walk from moscone center where our conference was.  setting could easily accomodate two meetings at once and the loft had all necessary meeting needs (white board, projector etc)  easy catering set up.    huge thanks for jessica and steven for allowing my team to use their home for our offsite. they were so quick to respond and very easy to coordinate with. their space was beautiful and the perfect size for my 13 person team. thank you!!!this is a great spot for a team offsite. location is great. hosts are very accommodating, and communication is easy. and of course, the loft is beautiful! thanks!jessica and steven were off visiting other exotic locations. they left billy in charge. billy was great...he got us in and out very efficiently. the loft fit our needs perfectly.  perfect for a bunch of midwives! we all loved the spa bath...and the coffee bar. location was great we enjoyed entertaining our dr. friends from acog...oh and then there was that record collection...perfect! \\r\\nlisting was great and the spot was exactly what i hoped  it to be. my team enjoyed the space and my colleague who stayed here felt at home. i think this was also a great value. we\\'ll be staying here again, and i think our engineering team is also interested in their own mini offsite here. thanks!simple to organize and a great alternative to hotel meeting rooms.host offered us a complimentary bottle of wine and nespresso. the place was wonderful and exactly as advertised. fantastic alternative to a hotel conference room! appreciated jessica\\'s quick response to messages. billy was welcoming. great location for our 9-person team offsite. comfortable, clean, centrally located, and a nice setup for using the whiteboard and having small breakout sessions. prompt responses from jessica, steven and their friend billy, who was friendly and on-time to let us in and out of the space. loved all of the natural light as well. i\\'d definitely come back.great place, awesome location. we had a blast. great place for an off-site meeting. well equipped, central to bart and great light!we lived 1 week in this great loft in the middle of sf downtown. the place is arranged with taste, and you will find everything you need. jessica and steven are also lovely people, they were very helpful. recommended if you like to be in the heart of the city!the loft is exactly as described: very hip, wonderfully furnished, and an excellent location. i would highly recommend it for a vacationing couple or a small business event. you really can\\'t beat the location, a short walk from yerba buena gardens and the moscone on a quiet side street.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor business meetings, note that the loft includes a large whiteboard, a projector, and screen-painted walls. an assortment of cables and accessories are available as well. note too that the kitchen includes serving plates and utensils for dozens of people, much more than is visible in the photos. the floors are larger than they appear in the photos as well.i rented this space for a corporate function and it worked so well. not only did we get a lot of compliments on the space but it was exactly what their photos depicted. jessica was a great host and made sure she was readily available in case anything went wrong (which nothing did!). would definitely recommend this loft to anyone looking for a hip space and good location in san francisco.we had a wonderful 3-days working offsite here. jessica and steve were responsive hosts and have thought of everything. special touches like the record player (and collection), whiteboard and projector made for a fun and productive space!jessica and steven\\'s loft was perfect! it is in a perfect location for getting anywhere you need to go in the city and comfortably slept our group. it allowed for a great work environment during the day where we could all spread out but still be close enough to communicate. jessica and steven were flexible and responsive and i would 100% stay here in the future.  we had a great offsite day in jessica and steven\\'s awesome loft. the place was great for our 12 person group with wifi and projector and all the supplies we needed. highly recommend for groups looking for a comfortable spot for an offsite. we used jessica and steven\\'s place for a team offsite and it was perfect! everything we needed, from a whiteboard to a projector to  working space, was provided. they even left us snacks, iced coffee and tea daily. the location was also conveniently located near public transit and multiple parking lots. next time we have an offsite, we will definitely look to use their space. great place / location. amazing hosts. perfect for hosting stay and working sessions in the city. this place is simply great. steven was a very relaxed but attentive host. this was the second time my team and i have used this space and i dare say we\\'ll be back! this was a perfect place for our companies strategic offsite. lots of space, large kitchen, close to everything in soma. \\n\\nthe hosts were responsive, friendly and accessible when needed. i will likely use this location again. fantastic space! we were in town for a conference, and jessica and steven\\'s loft was incredibly comfortable to stay in, and a fantastic space to run a small business meeting in during the day.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d stay here again in a heartbeat.the loft is amazing and hip. hosts jessica and steven are very sweet and professional. my colleagues and i enjoyed hosting our small private event there and would love to go back again. communicating with jessica was easy breezy, she\\'s very responsive and though she was out of town at the time of ours stay she made arrangements with billy, another resident living close by, to meet us upon check-in and give us the tour. \\r\\n\\r\\nand what a tour it was! the loft is bee-you-tee-full (beautiful), and the record collection is pretty fantastic. highly recommend constantly playing the original star wars soundtrack. we used this space as a place to meet with colleagues during a convention at the moscone (which is only one block away), and everyone that stepped into its warm, welcoming walls immediately commented on how lovely the place was. \\r\\n\\r\\nno drawbacks here, unless you\\'re not a fan of taking off your shoes when entering (this goes for guests) as that is an unbreakable house rule--we certainly didn\\'t mind it, and as far as we could tell neither did anyone else. besides, jessica provides wonderfully comfortable slippers for those to use while inside the loft sans shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n11 out of 10, would absolutely stay here again. jessica and steven are stellar hosts. we had an 11 person offsite in their amazing home. the white board, dining room table, and large kitchen are especially helpful for a team spending a day there. the space was wonderful and several people commented on it. very welcoming with great sunlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould definitely recommend staying there!

\\r\\ni would definitely recommend diane to anyone staying in the san francisco area. i, for one, hope to be able to stay there again... if she lets me :)\\r\\n\\r\\n**highlight: she is mailing back some stuff my friends left. what hotel does that? diane is the best!**fantastic house for our purpose (family with two adult kids). 3 generous bedrooms. silent surroundings, but yet within walking distance from \"everything\": north beach (including \"mama\\'s\" - -), pier 39, lombard curves, coit tower, exploratorium - and chinatown/union square.\\r\\n\\r\\nfully and well equipped kitchen, excellent av equipment. and diane even had several guide books available.\\r\\n\\r\\nintenet bandwidth for the wireless was good.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe garage also came in handy.\\r\\n\\r\\ndiane was not able to meet us, but left clear instructions - so no problem.\\r\\n\\r\\ncertainly a place where i could have moved in. highly recommended, and hopefully i will be able to visit again.what a location!  down the hill from coit tower, up from washington square, within walking distance of amazing espressos, city lights, great gelato and italian food, etc etc.  diane was generous with her home, which is roomy and even has an interior/shared courtyard.  we also paid extra to keep our car in the garage, which was a help for us.  we had plenty of space for six.  a perfect location, beautiful and unique home, and a lovely owner who was nothing but pleasant to work with. next time i\\'m in san francisco, i hope this place is available again. thanks!the house was on a great location, nice and quiet though still in the middle of the buzz. however, be prepared to find personal belongings scattered around the house, especially encountering other peoples toilettries in the bathroom was kind of awkward. furthermore, fridge was full of someone elses leftovers. the laundry was piled up in huge piles in the laundryroom. we did not mind, but it was somehow a bit weird. nevertheless, we had a great vacation!there were five adults in our party and the house was very accomodating for us.  the location couldn\\'t have been better!  we were able to walk to fisherman\\'s wharf and many other destinations.  we all felt at home and would definately stay here again.  thanks diane for opening your home to us!  until we meet again......\\r\\ndiane is an absolute sweetheart and her house is more than perfect for a trip to see the best of san francisco.  incredible location in walking distance to everything!  the house has literally everything you would need in your own home and more.  diane was on call when we needed her and made sure that we all felt really welcome (including my little one).\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks so so much diane and if we get to come back to san fran then we\\'ll definitely give you a call.   i would recommend this house to any and everyone looking for somewhere great to stay in san francisco.\\r\\n my girlfriends and i stayed at diane\\'s home in order to participate in our friend\\'s sf wedding. generally speaking the home was sufficient for our needs with enough beds, showers, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately, we had a few negative experiences:\\r\\n1. the dishwasher was full of dirty dishes. we had to search for clean towels. there was no room in the refrigerator. the tv was in a location where it could not be watched due to recent furniture rearrangement. diane offered to send someone over to move it during our stay. we declined as we were hoping to not deal with things of that nature during our vacation.\\r\\n2. we were expected to care for the cat (feed, stop it from bolting out the front door, and sleep with it so it would stop whining).\\r\\n3. diane insisted on stopping by during the time period we had rented her home. she did so while we were not home even-though we had not given her permission.\\r\\n\\r\\nmaybe our expectations were too high as this was our first airbnb experience but we assumed privacy, fully functioning appliances/electronics and no extraneous chores as it was our vacation. given the cost of this house, i would have expected more. \\r\\n\\r\\nit has plenty of room for a group, we hosted a nice cocktail party, and the place was clean. we paid extra for the parking which made life much simpler and she has a nice courtyard. in the future i will ask more questions prior to selecting a location just to be sure we are on the same page. valerie is an absolutely wonderful host, and we had a great time staying in this beautiful, clean house! it is colorful and airy, with delightful artwork on the walls. i was so happy to come home and melt into the bed after long days of work in the city. we hope to stay here again on future visits. valerie was an excellent communicator and had very clear instructions for everything. the street the house is on is peaceful, but the neighborhood is bustling and very central to everything. plus, there was a great place for breakfast around the corner! looking forward to my next visit!this house is amazing! it\\'s huge, bright, and open with a private bathroom in each room! the rooftop deck has an amazing garden and it\\'s really a lovely place to spend an afternoon. valerie is a great host, very communicative online, and super sweet. thanks so much for a sharing a great home!this house is amazing! its huge and was great for my family to come together for a wonderful vacation. the kitchen had all the pots and pans we needed and the roof deck was a sweet place to hang out in the sun. valerie is a great host, and i’d definitely stay here again.melissa was a fantastic host! she was quick to reply to my emails and texts, and was flexible when a flight delay pushed back my check-in time by several hours. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe place itself is lovely and spacious and clean, with tons of natural light. the airbed was quite comfy and the bathroom was modern and spotless. it\\'s also worth noting that there\\'s a trader joe\\'s just a few blocks north —\\xa0definitely a plus.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d highly recommend staying here. \\r\\nboth melissa and her place could not have been a better experience, and much more than i was expecting.  communication was great.  her place is beautiful, relaxing, clean, very comfortable, and complete with a sweet personable lovable kitty.  she is a great hostess, and a new friend.  i would highly recommend to anyone! mellissa is an excellent host! i had concerns about the cat but it turned out that the cat is not the dender sheding kind and is actually quite friendly and funny. attached (clean!) bathroom was a definite plus for me. overall a satisfying experience. the location is great and the condo is quite nice and cozy.hosts like melissa are the reason why airbnb has become such a life-changer for the masses. she was amazing, accommodating, and has the most cuddly cat! i was so busy on a work trip that i wished i had more time to spend with her. she had great reccomendations for food in the neighborhood and was incredibly easy to communicate with. i highly recommend her as a host and i\\'m certain she is an excellent guest to have as well. thanks melissa! can\\'t wait to visit sf again and hopefully stay at your place. melissa was terrific! very accommodating and helpful, despite the fact that she has such a busy and exciting life. she made getting the key very easy with a lockbox since she couldn\\'t be there when i arrived. the loft is just as beautiful as the photos represent, and it\\'s on the sunny side of the city, so the big windows and skylights are really lovely. the location was ideal for me  - close to the mission for endless choices for food and entertainment, blocks from grocery shopping, and close to my business needs.i really enjoyed my stay at melissa’s stunning soma loft: a fantastic space with a huge open kitchen and a really comfortable bedroom with private ensuite bathroom. great location with nice places to eat and great cafes within walking distance including my favourite coffee spot : the papa november truck! it’s close to the mission and easy access to both downtown sf and sfo airport. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft has amazing views of san francisco and the huge floor to ceiling windows capture a ton of sunshine throughout the day, there’s a also a great deck to sit out and a lovely shared patio where josie the cat loves to hang out. he’s just the most adorable & cuddly cat ever and i loved being welcomed by josie when i got back to the flat after a day at work. \\r\\n\\r\\ni had a great time cycling around sf, sampling the delicious food (incl. some gorgeous home cooked meals). melissa is a wonderful and easy-going host, i felt really lucky to have met her and some of her amazing friends and i really enjoyed socialising with them. it definitely felt like home for a couple of weeks!\\r\\ncommunication was extremely easy throughout my stay and i would not hesitate staying here again, i highly recommend it! thanks again for being such a great host melissa!melissa\\'s place was a peaceful and wonderful oasis after two long-haul flights. even though i arrived quite late in the evening, melissa was most welcoming and a fantastic person to converse with.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is a real loft with a great workspace upstairs. the room was spacious (including huge storage) and extremely clean. the same goes for the bathroom and show (nice big, shower). melissa\\'s washing machine, dryer and steam iron also came in handy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is superb, a nice, quiet neighbourhood, with stunninv views out of the windows. whole foods (excellent, organice, fresh produce!) is located close by for all your needs (even breakfast, lunch and dinner). bars and restaurants are plentiful (check melissa\\'s map).\\r\\ngetting an uber/lyft or taxi is very easy, but i would recommend walking to get a real feel for sf. nothing is too far away, caltrain and bart both within 15min walk. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall i can only recommend staying at melissa\\'s place, i had a wonderful time there and will be sure to book again when returning to sf!melissa is the perfect host. her place is extraordinary, a true find on airbnb.\\r\\ni am coming back as often as she\\'ll let me :)i extended my stay with melissa and stayed another week.\\r\\nplease see my other comments - her place is worth the cost, it was perfect.a beautiful apartment, very friendly and helpful host, and a lovely cat.  great location, melissa pointed me to nice places to eat and drink and all made for a perfect stay.melissa rocks, her place is great and in a good location and her cat is a total sweetheart. she was very generous with her hospitality and i would absolutely stay there again. a great first airbnb experience. thanks melissa!yes!

i required last minute short-term accommodation for my work stint at ucsf, and with no prior reviews as this was my very first airbnb booking, melissa kindly reached out and helped me with my living situation in the city. she was an extremely kind, considerate and professional host and i had a very comfortable and safe stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa\\'s apartment is every bit as nice in reality as it appears on the listing.  the accommodations & her hospitality helped make my recent trip to san francisco a truly great one.  if you\\'re looking to share a top-notch apartment in an up & coming sf neighborhood, i highly recommend melissa\\'s place.  \\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s the second time i stayed with melissa and i\\'ve had yet another amazing / magical experience. she really went above and beyond to make me feel right at home. i had a fantastic time meeting many of her awesome friends over dinner and drinks, they\\'re all so easy going, it truly felt like i made loads of life long friends in a couple of weeks. and josie the cat is still the most adorable/loving creature out there. i was very tempted to kidnap him but wouldn\\'t have been fair for either mel or josie ;)\\r\\nthank you so much melissa!

the living area was clean and exactly as described. very close to the fun. we were there to see the city, so we were in and out most of the time!zayah and natasha are awesome people. i shared great conversations with them, and wine too. the place was exactly as described. located near the top of lombard st, i was welcomed by tourists from all over the world in day time, while was dipped into surprising quietness during the night. it does require some leg work to climb up and down the ramp between the house and the bus station. but i\\'m young and athletic so i had no problem with it. i could also use their kitchen to make some breakfast. totally fabulous experience. would definitely recommend to people who are looking for some antique and hilly experience.my husband and i stayed for two nights in zayah\\'s apartment. the location was fantastic and super central (the first thing we saw in the morning when stepping out of the door was lombard street :). \\r\\nthe couch in the living room we slept on was big and comfortable, just as described. the only thing i\\'d say needs improvement is the shower, as there was not a lot of water pressure and it takes quite some time to get the shampoo out of the hair ;) \\r\\nall together we enjoyed our time in san francisco and zayah and his girlfriend (who is an incredible musician) welcomed us warmly. thank you!zayah was a very respectful and accommodating host. his partner natasha was great as well, providing great tips to get around san francisco. she\\'s also a great singer, as i heard a few of her originals. \\ngreat location to get around town and walking distance to fisherman\\'s wharf and fort mason (for conference goers). \\non clear sf day, a great way to step outside and see the city, just below the crooked street. \\nthanks z!zayah was very accommodating considering my flight was delayed and i got to his place at almost 2am. great location and a great price. everything was very clean and i felt at home. awesome views of the city and alcatraz from just a few feet away. if you want to stay in north beach, this is the place for you!excellent experience.\\r\\nperfect location to visit san francisco, walking distance from many places and convenient. lovely view & safe place.\\r\\ngreat welcome by zayah. comfortable and clean place.zayah was there to greet us and answer any questions we had. neighborhood was centrally located. street parking available. the location of the listing was very central and easy to navigate around while exploring central sf areas. zayah was helpful with making it easy to move in and be ready to explore the city. the location is very central, although the grade of the hill getting to the apartment is pretty steep if you\\'re not from san francisco. it wasn\\'t a huge issue, but it\\'s something to be aware of.location is superb! it\\'s a quiet neighborhood so no noise at night. there is a small balcony which i didn\\'t use because of cold weather but that looked really nice. living room itself is quite dark, could use some more light. you sleep on the couch, which isn\\'t uncomfortable but real sheets/duvet instead of a sleeping bag would be nice and feels cleaner. you have full access to the kitchen so you can cook and make tea if you want to. remember that you share the owner, so do realize you don\\'t have 100% privacy. zayah is a really nice guy though. zayah was hospitable and the victorian was quite beautiful.  his recommendations for bars, wineries, and pizzerias were taken up and enjoyed.perfect place with a nice gentleman!zayah is a discrete  person.the  apartment is very  well  located in  a quiet place . breakfast on the  balcony  is very  nice  . there is all  amenities you need  in  kitchen and (url hidden) should be  good  to renew the  covers  and pillows . it\\'s little to dark at the evening , should install  an extra lamp  .thank\\'s zayah for these  4 days  in sfo ..very  good  remembering ...don\\'t  hesitate to  rent  zayah\\'s beedroom.thank you so much for the warm welcoming.\\nlocation was perfect and it felt just like home. zayah is great!

when we did see tim and young mi, it was nice chatting with them about our adventures. wish we could have seen them more, but we were out most of the time. also there\\'s tag and trixie, two adorable lovable shiba inus that were very well-behaved and so nice to have around. the place itself is amazing. the space looks just like the pictures (or better). so spacious, modern, clean, and perfect down to every detail. i\\'m so happy and grateful we got the chance to experience living their gorgeous home and meet such wonderful, kind, really cool hosts. it made for an awesome first airbnb experience in san francisco. i would definitely stay here again in the future. tim and his beautiful wife were soon nice!

very safe, beautiful scenery, and so much to do. 2) listing: the entrance and hallway are shared but i still had privacy. two bedrooms are connected with a private bathroom which is perfect if you are traveling with family/friends. 3) amenities: everything is available (even sleepers!) except washer and dryer, but young mi and tim said they\\'ll soon be able to have washer and dryer available for use for guests. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall, it is the best listing i\\'ve stayed at so far - cannot be hesitant to recommend to everyone, as it will be a great choice regardless of the type of trip - business trip, family vacation, etc. thanks young mi, tim, tag, and trixie!the place is as listed on the site, that is, very clean and cozy and in an safe quiet neighborhood!

just several minutes far away from fishermans wharf. i really enjoyed my stay in san francisco.we were lucky to get ilona\\'s huge house only two days before arriving, not easy for a group with 10 people. the house has been newly refurbished, and even has a small garden. it\\'s not very central, but the highway is literally passing next by.yeah, everything is exactly whats describable. love this house.pretty big town house that allows more than 10 people to stay easily. inside was very clean and beds were comfortable. there\\'s no much around but it\\'s close to the highway so it was good.the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.this was my shortest but best airbnb experience so far. michael was the nicest and most thoughtful host one could hope for. he really took care of any concerns or questions that i had and helped me figure out how to make the most out of my stay. he has the coolest dog ever named enzo who really showed me why dogs are considered to be a mans best friend. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe room was cozy and decorated beautifully, the bathroom was clean and tidy and the kitchen as well as living room simply stunning. this apartment is really a jewel in mission and michael can easily consider himself a hobby interior designer. the apartment is located in a vibrant area with many restaurant/cafe options for a quick meal or fine dining. \\r\\n\\r\\ngetting around is also no issue seeing as there are many cabs in the area as well as the bart train on 16th. simply an awesome host and beautiful apartment! michael is an awesome, friendly host with one of the nicest homes i\\'ve stayed in yet. location couldn\\'t be better and the dog couldn\\'t be friendlier.very friendly host!we were searching for a place between the ideas of san francisco we wanted to get deep into: the techy geeky one, the psychedelic-hipster one and the casual, daily one. we found a beautiful house with a nice, smart, generous host, located in the exact place where these ideas collide: mission district, between the poshy valencia and the rough mission. among clubbers and homeless, yuppies and hispanish locals, millionaires and hipsters. the room is white, clean, cozy. the kitchen makes you envious. michael is kind, welcoming and has the spirit of a traveller, which helps because you are one of those. enzo, the house puppy, never barked anytime. see you soon san francisco!we felt fortunate to spend at michaels\\' beautiful home. the pictures do not do it justice. michael has a great eye and his place was a labor of love. comfortable, uncluttered yet well equipped due to michael\\'s thoughtfulness. \\r\\n  the misson district is a very hip neighborhood, diversity, delicious eateries truly a foodie heaven. easy access to public transportation but it is also a friendly waking and biking town. m. will give you tips on how to avoid the hills. \\r\\n  michael and san franciscoans were friendly and caring suggesting what we should avoid, guiding us around the city and riffing on what we were interested in. \\r\\n  we highly recommend modern rustic for your stay. the place is way -cool  and the host is also so pleasing. ross and sylvia \\r\\n  note his dog enzo is well behaved and beautiful. \\r\\nmichael was an amazing and considerate host and the space itself was incredible and well-designed. our jaws dropped when we saw it - the photos, while great, don\\'t do it justice. the location was perfect for our needs (just a short walk from the 16th and mission bart station) and everything was clean and there were all kinds of nice touches, like snacks, water and extra toiletries.\\r\\n\\r\\neverything went beyond our expectations, from the balcony, the fireplace, the comfortable bed, the shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nmichael also gave us a great rundown of the neighborhood and recommended some of his favorite places to eat, one of which we tried out for brunch. excellent recommendation.\\r\\n\\r\\nwish we had been able to stay more than a single night.  we\\'ve already made a promise to stay here again the next time we come to san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nalso enzo is awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend staying with michael! as a first time user of airbnb, i was definitely apprehensive when i was selecting places to stay. i picked this place because the photos looked gorgeous. and after my stay, can definitely say that the room does not disappoint. it\\'s a big spacious sleeping area, bathroom, as well as work/living space. the room is on the top floor, above the other parts of the apartment so there is plenty of privacy. there is even a balcony with a gorgeous view of the city! the space was remodeled and designed by michael, so you can see a lot of love that went into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nmichael is a wonderful, considerate host. he made me feel welcoming and comfortable from the start, even before i landed in sf when we started messaging about my upcoming stay. his roommates are also lovely, and his dog is adorable and extremely friendly. could not recommend enough! would definitely stay with michael again if i\\'m ever visiting the area again.my brother and sister-in-law decided to visit on fairly short notice, near my birthday. michael was very responsive and helpful during the booking, pre-visit, and during the visit. i would highly recommend michael\\'s unique and private space for future visiting friends and family.great host with an amazing property in the heart of the mission area. the space is spacious, modern, rustic, with a great panoramic view of san francisco. feels like a boutique hotel. michael is very friendly and has a lot of stories to share. michael goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. enzo, his dog, is the best dog anyone could ask for. i would definitely stay again and recommend staying at michael\\'s place.michael has designed a beautiful loft in the lively mission district; close to dolores park.  the 4th floor suite is not only lovely but very functional.  the bed is very comfortable, the bathroom is gorgeous and you even get a well-appointed sitting room in the front of the loft.  a fireplace warms up the room and a large screen tv is hung on the ceiling with access to apple tv.   i would also like to mention the deck with a beautiful view of the city and all the skylights in the loft that bring in natural sunlight.   in addition, you have access to the fabulous kitchen on the third floor.  michael has done an excellent job of designing a comfortable and beautiful space. he is a very kind, friendly and informative host, as well. we would not hesitate to stay there next time we visit san francisco.our stay at michael\\'s was better than we could have expected. the space was cool and spacious with impeccable decor. he was also very welcoming and hospitable. we wish we had more time and would recommend anyone to stay here if they get a chance.it was great staying at micheals. not only the apartment is really nice as he\\'s also very thoughtful. everything is neat and very well taken care of. i arrived with nice music playing on the ipod. the shower had shampoo, conditioner and soap. fresh water to drink by the bedroom and even a little chocolate treat. thanks a lot my friend!!\\r\\nwhen back in san francisco, i\\'ll definitely try to stay there again. this place is for you if you love cozy, distributed spaces. since i arrived here michael explained me how to get to my destination and provided me some excellent places to get lunch in the neighborhood, which make me feel well received.\\r\\nyou must be aware of the high activity in mission, but if you´re ok then this is the place to consider when visiting sf, very clean, nice, and excellent host.wow - where to start? i am in love with this place. if only i could have stayed longer! it is even better in person than in the pictures. the fireplace makes everything so cozy, the lighting is incredibly well done, everything is gorgeous, clean and architecturally stunning. the bed was so comfortable, i only got out to read on the equally comfortable chaise lounge. i hate to even leave such a positive review because i don\\'t want others to steal my new secret jewel in san francisco. thanks michael for a wonderful experience. i\\'ll be back! michael\\'s living space does not disappoint. in other words, the photos and description are spot on.  his suite is the perfect landing spot in san francisco.  i felt like i was in the hand of an interesting, thoughtful and street-smart californian.   my travel schedule was complicated and michael was flexible and supportive.  the location in mission is sure to give you an authentic view of life in san francisco with access to parks, unique restaurants and shops.we had a great sf experience! michael is a superb host. we can recommend this place to everyone! great location, spacious room, well designed. we will stay here again when visiting san francisco! michael\\'s loft is wonderful and might be the perfect spot in sf! we booked the place for my mom who was visiting the city and she had a great time. the loft is clean, bright, super stylish and very comfortable. on top of that, michael is the most courteous and hospitable host you can wish for. he was very responsive before and throughout the entire stay. very much recommended. wow is all i have to say! this place is great!! we had an absolute wonderful time! michael is an absolute great host! even though we had other plans we could have spent the entire weekend in the mission district and had a great time! there are so many great bars and restaurants within walking distance. the loft itself is stunning! it was beyond my expectations! see you on the next visit to san fran! my boyfriend and i stayed with michael for 3 nights and we couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay and host! as we were new in town, michael showed us round a bit and was very helpful with places to go and see. the accommodation is totally private and essentially self contained so it has everything that you need! michael truly went above and beyond for us and really made our time in san fran a memorable experience!!! a truly elegant and comfortable place with an abundance of special touches such as fresh flowers, snacks, bottled water, sound dock system, interesting magazines and books, etc. michael is the most attentive and thoughtful host and i could not be happier with my stay. i’m a little torn as to whether i should write a glowing review or a negative one. if i heap more kind words onto michael’s growing pile, his idyllic loft might never be vacant (for my intended return) again. \\r\\n\\r\\n michael, like the space itself, far exceeded expectations. while it was decidedly our privilege to stay in his tasteful, thoughtfully renovated home, he consistently went out of his way to improve our stay further. it was as if we were family, or old college buddies (who drink too much when they get together and spill wine sometimes). \\r\\n\\r\\nin short, you’d be crazy to stay anywhere else – you’ll pay the same price for an experience one forth as thoughtful, unique, and crisp.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks again michael,\\r\\njames and erica\\r\\nmy friend and i stayed with michael for a few days during a trip to the west coast. he was friendly and more than happy to give advice about the neighborhood. his apartment is in a fantastic location... very close to bars and great food. the house itself is absolutely beautiful. i will definitely be back on my next trip to sf!excellent experience from start to finish! very short notice stay and micheal was able to accommodate with prompt communication throughout. the room is as expected...perfect! as a fellow host i will be stealing ideas because of micheal\\'s attention to detail. i will be back! our experience has just bee great. nice warm and happy welcome very nice house in a fun part of town... and having a glass of white wine on the private terrace\\r\\nwith a 360 view on dear old sf was an \"absolute merveille\" .\\r\\nmerci michael pour le vin et le café tôt le matin  gentiment déposé en haut des marches pour les lèves-tôt !\\r\\nmariemichael is a great host. this is an ideal location, right in the heart of one of my favorite sf neighborhoods. the flat was very comfortable—well designed, and open with plenty of light. i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and hope to stay here again soon. michael is an amazing host, he is super friendly and warm ...his place is just beautiful!\\r\\nthe attention to detail and style at his place is off the charts :)\\r\\nthe location is fantastic, a great neighborhood, and walking distance to great restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you michael!\\r\\ni would love to stay at your place again!\\r\\nall the best!we really enjoyed our stay with michael. he made us feel right at home from the start and gave us some good point outs for the area. michael is very sociable, nice to talk to and will do about anything to make your stay more comfortable. it is no surprise then that we found michael to be a great host.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft is really beautiful and spacious and although it is located inside the house, it gave us all the privacy we needed to get over our jetlag or when we just needed some rest after a long day in san francisco. the ceiling height was no problem at all for us, even with boyfriend being 1.89m (6\\'2).\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally the mission district is a great neighborhood, specially valencia street with lots of restaurants and local shops.wow.  it doesn\\'t get much better than this. the place is amazing and michael was responsive and thoughtful. i will be staying here when i go back to the city. michael was an amazing host, who directed us to fantastic restaurants and areas in the mission district. the space was even better than the pictures--very spacious and comfortable. great shower and nice patio. highly recommend the mission district--it had great food, shopping and it was really easy to get to from the airport. thanks for a great visit to sf, michael! michael provided me with a great loft with spectacular views of san francisco and located in the best region for food lovers. the loft was well designed, immaculate and michael made sure i was comfortable even while he was in another country! i found a home away from home and will be coming back to michael\\'s mission loft whenever i come back to this beautiful city. if you\\'re looking for a great place to stay, look no further!very great moment in sf tanks to michael and his so nice soft loft \"petit nid d\\'amour\" very comfortable and so well designed. we also very much appreciated his delicate attention and all the good recommandations he gave us regarding bars, restaurants in the neighbourhood of his apartment. thank you very much michael for our very first experience on airbnb we are very satisfied.michael\\'s place is amazing! couldn\\'t ask for a better experience, location, and host. he was so kind and fun to talk with, helped with parking suggestions along with food and coffee spots. the space is incredible, felt like staying in a high-end hotel, the shower, bed, deck.. all really well done and totally comfortable. the light was amazing from the sky lights, and the view on the deck was breathtaking.  i only wish we could have stayed longer, will def be staying here again next time in sf. thanks michael!nice place and great host. michael is the best host you could ask for. he treats the room like a hotel with all of the thoughtful items you could ask for, bottle of wine, spare toothpaste, toiletries, blankets for the nearby park, etc. the house is phenomenal and could appear in dwell magazine, including the rentable area upstairs. the rooftop is great with uninstructed views of the city, we sat out here mornings and evenings with coffee and wine, really great amenity.  the location is a 10, the condo sits at the main horizontal street between the two prime commercial corridors in the mission district. when you go on yelp/urban spoon and look at top restaurants in all of san fran 10 are within 4 blocks in any direction, including the best coffee and boutique shopping in the city.  this place would be great with a bad host but michael goes above and beyond and has great knowledge of the city and the best places to eat/see making him an indispensable source of local guidance.  he is also super nice and has a wonderful dog that really make you feel at home. we will stay here when staying in san fran again.it was my first time using airbnb and i could not have asked for a better experience! the room was absolutely beautiful and michael was a great host. definitely take his advice on restaurant recommendations and things to see in the city.michael\\'s mission loft was nothing less than superb.  his space is just as nice (or nicer) than the pictures.  the rooftop outdoor space is incredible.  there is no doubt michael\\'s place will eventually be a \"best of airbnb\" listing. \\r\\n\\r\\nnot only is michael\\'s place great, but michael is a wonderful host.  he had the perfect restaurant recommendations and focused on every little detail to ensure my stay was top notch.  enzo, michael\\'s dog, is also awesome.  michael was a great host, and the apartment that he designed is beautiful. i was quite impressed by his attention to detail both in designing the room and the experience. there was music from pandora setup and playing when i arrived. two bath robes next to his very unique rain shower. skylights are placed strategically to provide natural lighting over focal points in each area. he even stocked the fridge with some drinks and snacks. if he would let me live there, i would. this was our first airbnb stay so we did not know what to expect.  michael\\'s loft and service were fantastic.\\r\\n\\r\\nprior to our stay michael communicated clearly how and when we could meet to receive the keys and also offered any other assistance or guidance regarding our stay.  as first timers using airbnb this communication was really appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft is right between mission and valencia, a fantastic place to stay to experience the real san fran.  my wife and i ate and drank, and shopped in many of the nearby locales, all within walking distance.  when venturing further, we used the inexpensive bart which had a stop a couple of blocks away from the loft.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft itself was exactly as it appeared in the photos on airbnb.  it was well styled.  the loft comes with a large comfortable bed, warm fire place, large bath sheets, common shower amenities and some beers and other beverages waiting in the fridge on our arrival.  it was a private space, separate from the rest of the house but with a homely feel. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe didn\\'t get to spend much time with michael due to a busy itinerary but in the exchanges we had he was warm and inviting, and happy to share insights about the neighbourhood he clearly loves.  we followed a few of michael\\'s recommendations for places to visit and eat and were glad we did.\\r\\n\\r\\nan absolutely great experience, i have no hesitation in recommending the mission loft as a \\'must\\' place to stay.  if i get back to san fran again, i will definitely be coming back!\\r\\n\\r\\ncan i give this 10 stars instead of just 5? michael and his airbnb far exceeded our expectations. not only was the space impeccably clean, but each tiny detail of the loft was so intentionally and incredibly designed. the deck was just a dream with gorgeous views of the city in almost every direction. the natural lighting was my favorite. there are skylights absolutely everywhere, allowing the most beautiful light in. the bed was so comfy! michael was everything a host should be and more, and he honestly felt more like a friend than anything. he spent a great amount of time with us to explain the best must-eat\\'s and must-do\\'s of the city. he was always available by phone/text for random questions i had and was extremely warm and welcoming...and kept it real all around. (;  i will be recommending this place to everyone i know and i cannot wait to come back! i wouldn\\'t stay anywhere else. yes, the house is amazing, phenomenal. beautiful decorated, i loved the rain shower and the roof terrace. neighborhood? also awesome. right around the corner of a very popular street with restaurants and bars. but the number 1 reason you want to stay here: \\r\\nmichael himself.\\r\\nbecause that was the best part about my visit: i had the change to hang out with michael. he’s amazing. very friendly, always available for a chat, intelligent, energetic, thoughtful…he made me feel warm & welcome from the start. he lifted my heavy suitcase to the room and he shared his delicious wine and lunch with me. it was as if we were friends, beyond my expectations. \\r\\nhe puts a lot of effort to make you feel at home: i found flowers, fresh water, fruit and energy bars in my room. even a bathrobe! he’s very respectful of your privacy, but i loved to get to know him a little and hang in the kitchen a lot, just to talk with him :) and pet his adorable dog enzo.\\r\\nwhat a gem of a place in the mission district!  michael contacted me a week prior to my stay.  he met me as arranged and gave me a lovely welcome.  you can bypass the rest of michael\\'s home to access the living space.  it had a cozy feeling but was comfortable and spacious.i had a great stay at michael\\'s house. michael is a great host. the upstairs room was spacious, well designed and had great outdoor space with views of sf.  the shower was great too! michael was the greatest host. helpful with local insights, super friendly and a wonderful person to have a meaningful conversation over food. i could spend all day speaking about his positive points but words would not be enough. the room was amazing and really luxurious. would stay with michael whenever i am back in sf for sure me and my girlfriend stayed here for only one night because of a delayed flight, which was waaay to short. we couldn\\'t decide wether to spend our limited time enjoying the wonderful loft and the exceptional views from the deck, or michael\\'s super welcoming and fun company, or the perfect location in the middle of one of the most fun areas in the city. it was hard, but the kind of problem that we like to have. we clearly have to come back here. and i highly recommend this to anyone needing a place to stay in san francisco. obviously.michael\\'s space is a dream come true.  a place where you wake up and never want to leave.  it is a 6 star hotel.  i love the light that pours into the space, the convenient office, fridge, soothing shower and incredible views from the bathroom sink and patio of san francisco!!we had an amazing time at michael\\'s place.  when we got there, he met as at the door and led us up to the spectacular third floor that he artfully created himself.  his design sense is impeccable, and the space is incredibly inviting and cozy.  michael felt like an old friend, even though we had just met. he made some great recommendations of places to eat and see in the neighborhood, too.  we felt very at home and taken care of, and we can\\'t wait to go back to stay again.michael was great. was very welcoming, gave us the rundown of the neighborhood, showed us the place. room was exactly as it appears. let us know we were welcome to socialize with him, but there was no pressure to do so. even a couple of beers in the fridge of our room to welcome us!michael was excellent! i would without hesitation recommend his place to stay to anyone wanting a great place to stay while in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host - michael is a great host with prompt communication, sincere kindness, and a flexibility to accommodate you during your stay. he is a pleasure to talk with and has great knowledge of the city. thank you!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe listing - michael\\'s house is exactly like is mentioned and even better! this beautiful and very private loft is something out of a magazine. the pictures are not a lie and very real. everything was clean and functional. the bed is comfortable, the bathroom is functional/beautiful, the windows have shades for darkness, the deck has a view of the entire city, basically everything you need for a private getaway is provided in an amazing space.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood - parking: ample street parking if you have a car, the area has metered parking from 9am - 6pm. the area provides many bars & coffee shops near by and great public communication around the city. the subway is only a short walk away.\\r\\n\\r\\ndefinitely put this listing on your short list of beautiful places to stay. i would definitely stay here again!michael is a gracious host with a great attention to detail and the user experience.  the unit was immaculate and beautiful.  everything was in perfect working order.  the neighborhood is well-located and secure.  the place is a home run.  it is a walk-up so guests have to be capable of mounting 2 flights of stairs.there is not enough good things about michael and his apartment. the pictures represent the space so well, but, i honestly feel the space is better than even depicted. being that location is everything, this apartment is perfectly located in the mission district. michael provided every single thing we could possibly want as part of the stay with so many additional things. he was incredible with communication and was quite flexible with us leaving our bags afterward. what a fabulous space and a fabulously welcoming and hospitable host. we only had a short stay in sfo and wished it were at least a week longer so we could really enjoy the loft space and all the mission area had to offer. knowing we were on a culinary tour of the west coast micheal spent a great deal of his time giving us relevant info. both he and his flatmate were so welcoming and willing of their time and knowledge. it made us feel quite at home. we\\'ll definitely be returning, but for longer next time!michael\\'s loft apartment in the mission was fantastic! the interior design of the apartment is very tasteful - you will feel like you are staying in an apartment featured in dwell magazine. the outside deck has very nice views and on a sunny day like the one we experienced it was great to sit outside and have morning coffee. the location of the apartment is also very convenient for going out in the neighborhood.\\r\\ndespite being out of town for the weekend, michael was easy to communicate with, the apartment was spotlessly clean and he had very good suggestions for restaurants nearby. \\r\\ni highly recommend staying in the apartment for a visit to san francisco. my time in san francisco has been just like i imagined:  fun, adventurous and plush.  michael and his place have made this trip so much better because of his hospitality. his space is beautifully decorated, clean and quiet.  i would have no reservations recommending him to friends or others!   i highly recommend staying here. michael was in touch with us before our stay and allowed us to check in early.  the space consists of the entire top floor of the home (bedroom, bathroom with walk-in rainshower and double sinks, work space and last but not least a rooftop deck). the decorations are very clean and modern - we absolutely loved it. michael is one of the most gracious airbnb hosts and his space is lovely. michael built this home himself, so there are plenty of unique skylights that let in beautiful light throughout the day, and the home decor is modern, clean, and homey. the mission is a great location, and this space is an incredible deal for sf! we felt right at home. would 150% recommend staying here for a work trip or for fun. if you\\'re looking for a work space there is a wonderful private office to work in. thanks for everything, michael! we all really enjoyed meeting you.our stay over the 3 nights we were in san fran was awesome!  the space was exactly what we had expected and better.  the condo is so well decorated and clean; you can tell a great deal of time and effort was put into making this  space unique and comfortable.  we had tons of room upstairs and even access to our own outdoor rooftop patio.  michael really made us feel like home and i would strongly recommend this air bnb to anyone and everyone. the location was perfect for us. great neighbourhood with lots of shops and good restaurants, and a quick walk to the bart.\\r\\nstaying at michael\\'s made our first airbnb experience an amazing time. \\n\\neverything was far better than expected. clean, cozy, well located, and beautifully decorated place. \\n\\nmichael gave us a few nice suggestions for dinner and was always pending on our needs. i would definitely stay here again. felt as in home all the time. michael\\'s place is gorgeous. he\\'s gone above and beyond to make the place feel like a high end resort, in the middle of the mission. michael provided all the information needed to get to his place, all the amenities i could need, as well as local knowledge of the area. next time i\\'m in san francisco and need a place to stay, michael\\'s place will be the first i look up. thank you, michael!michael was an awesome host. he was super helpful, kind, and has a great spot. i would love to come back in the future!amazing place.. looked better than the pictures and location was even better!! had a mishap with the keys and michael was so nice about it. had an incredible stay and did not want to leave!even more than the friends i was there to visit, i miss michael\\'s place. i am a w hotel guy who likes his own space but i took a chance on what looked like a cool place.  w no more.  this loft, location, host (and pup enzo) were not only well represented on their profile but michael and his place had what cannot be described in words. suffice to say, it felt like home.  the place is immaculate, beautifully appointed and thoughtfully designed. michael is amazing and i am richer having met him.  he provided great information about sf, the mission, restaurants, transportation and accommodated my early arrival.  he made sure i never felt any pressure under his roof, incredible vacation.  highest marks across the board.  can hardly wait to book it again for next summer.  if anyone has any questions please do not hesitate to

the mission district, it\\'s a quick walk to wonderful restaurants and shops.  the loft is spacious, light-filled, and very comfortable. host michael has looked after every detail. we were warmly greeted and encouraged to let him know if there was anything we might need. we look forward to our next visit and our new home away from home.i was fortunate to visit michael\\'s mission loft on a sunny san francisco day. or perhaps unfortunate as i didn\\'t want to leave the open air back deck that looks out over the rest of the city! the place has fantastic natural light and is spacious and private. i\\'ll be visiting again.michael was the consummate host -- charming, welcoming and incredibly knowledgeable about the neighborhood and the city. he gave us great recommendations for restaurants, shops and places to visit. the loft apartment, while part of his apartment, is on a separate floor and very private. it is big, bright and airy with a patio with fantastic views of the neighborhoods and downtown. valencia street -- with its hipster vibe and great food -- is just around the corner and the bart station at 16th is a short walk away. great experience, great neighbourhood and wonderful host. this is a beautiful apartment in sf. micheal was nice and easy going and very happy to help. i have no words to describe how nice michael\\'s apartment is!! it looks

need.\\r\\nfinally, michael is the perfect host, very friendly, flexible and helpful. i am recommending this loft to all of my friends visiting san francisco.great interior design, location, and host ! michael is so sweet and easy to get in touch with very quickly. he was very accommodating and the view from the deck is amazing ! would stay here again next time i\\'m in sfwe had a wonderful stay at michael\\'s spacious, light and beautifully designed loft. i was travelling with a friend and found the space great for two parties as the living area has a futon. the loft is every bit as beautiful as the photos and in an excellent location only steps from an array of restaurants & bars on mission and valencia streets. as others attest michael is a fantastic host and was very helpful and accommodating. we\\'d love to come back.the loft is even more beautiful in person than in the pictures. michael was a fantastic host, and we really enjoyed the neighborhood. michael was an awesome host and his home was amazing. all the details of this house are beautiful and comfortable. the location is amazing right in the center of the mission. views from little roof area are great. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks so much for being an awesome host! would love to come back. a beautiful home. this was a lucky choice. it\\'s extremely quiet but right in the heart of one of the city\\'s liveliest neighborhoods. \\nmike couldn\\'t be more friendly, he was a pleasure to talk to and helped me with my bicycle getting in.\\ni even got to enjoy an episode of the walking dead on apple tv from the loft which was unexpected. plenty of details that set this getaway apart from the coziest of hotels.i stayed at michael\\'s place with my girlfriend and we both had a great stay. michael made us feel really welcome and the loft is even better than the pictures. the apartment is right in the heart of the mission neighbourhood, so you have easy access to all the cool restaurants and shops there.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft itself is a great space for a couple and is private and quiet. the space is immaculate as was the rest of michael\\'s place. we really enjoyed staying here and fell in love with michael\\'s dog, enzo.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould definitely recommend a stay here for a great san francisco experience!this is an absolutely wonderful place to stay.  michael is an outstanding and gregarious host and made us feel right at home.  you have the entire top floor to yourself (though you can borrow enzo the incredibly friendly dog.)  the place is spotless and comfortable, full of light and decorated tastefully.  we had no problem parking close by, which is surprising for san francisco.  great neighborhood with lots of life, small restaurants and stores, very few chains, street art and a broad diversity of locals.  we highly recommend dinner at the heirloom cafe (10 minute walk) and, while michael loves tartine, we ended up at a terrific bakery called craftsman and wolves on valencia for breakfast.  this is now our go to place to stay in sf.wow, what a place. michael is a wonderful host and his home is beautifully done and located in a great location. it is comfortable, quiet, and the rooftop deck provides a ridiculous view of the city. michael obviously takes his airbnb responsibilities seriously and goes the extra mile to ensure a memorable stay no matter if you are there for work or pleasure. i will be back!!my brother and i were in san francisco for the first annual airbnb open/host summit. i looked at a lot of listings before i came across michael\\'s mission loft but i fell in love as soon as i saw it. it was exactly what i was looking for; a beautiful victorian style home, bright and open, central location, and private but with just the right amount of interaction with the host. michael did not disappoint. i am an airbnb host as well and i promise you that michael takes pride and joy in his home and in being a host. the loft was clean, open, cozy and inviting. my brother and i had everything we needed and michael\\'s mission home was the perfect place to unwind and get a good night\\'s sleep before another busy day. if you\\'re considering a place to stay in san fran, look no further. this mission loft is a bargain.to call this place beautiful would be an understatement. michael\\'s loft is seriously one of the most beautiful i\\'ve ever stayed at. his design is immaculate and i felt like i was living in pure decadence. i want to move in! well, i\\'ll definitely be back.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe deck is magical, the shower is awesome and the desk perfect for met to work at. it\\'s an incredible space.\\r\\n\\r\\none thing, it has a lot of stairs. so if you have trouble with stairs, you might want to not do this one. \\r\\n\\r\\nbeyond that, michael goes way beyond the call of duty to ensure that i felt comfortable. he walked me through the whole process. i an tell that he loves being a host and does a great job with it. so, anyway, you get the point. a big thumbs up! oh and his dog is super cute and friendly.serendipity brought us to san francisco, mission, mission loft and, last but not least, our unforgettable host michael. we endorse all of the positive comments that have been offered already about mission loft: great location, beautiful space, thoughtful attention to detail. we were looking for a more personal experience than a hotel would give, and for us, michael\\'s generosity of spirit and genuine interest in us as guests, has made our stay a delight. heartfelt thanks to michael and a robust recommendation for the loft.michael is such a perfect host that he brings out the best in his guests. he has an impeccable and inspired space which is a reflection of the man, himself.wonderful location, wonderful space, wonderful experience!  will definitely keep michaels loft on a very short list of places to stay while in sf! my husband and i had a great experience staying at michael\\'s place.  from the get-go, he responded fast to emails and texts, and always went the extra mile to make us feel welcome.  we arrived with about 5 heavy suitcases and michael was gracious about carrying all of them up the stairs for us!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe saw the pictures of the place on airbnb, but were even more impressed when we actually went into the room.  the loft is gorgeous, and we enjoyed the great view of the city from the patio area.\\r\\n\\r\\nin a nutshell, the room exceeded our expectation and greatly enhanced our san francisco vacation!  we\\'ll be back!first and foremost, i\\'m a regular airbnb user and this space is the most amazing little gem i\\'ve ever stayed at on airbnb or elsewhere. so much thought, time, energy, creativity, and capital were invested into this space and it truly shines and makes the guest feel like they are home. not only was the space amazing, but michael is truly the most down to earth, genuinely nice guy out there. my girlfriend and i stayed here together and we found ourselves on a few occasions just getting wrapped up in great conversation with our host. additionally, the area is filled with so many great places to explore from restaurants to bars, home goods, clothing stores, coffee, chocolate, etc. top notch in all aspects. i will definitely be a repeat customer and would highly recommend anyone thinking about going to sf to stay here. my stay with michael was fantastic!  it\\'s such a beautiful, luxurious space (including a marvelous gas fireplace in front of the bed - very much appreciated on cold and rainy days).  michael is friendly and welcoming, and made sure i had everything i needed.  quiet, clean, comfortable, and simply gorgeous.  i felt very spoiled staying here, especially compared to some of the higher priced and far less nice hotel rooms where some of my friends stayed.michael was such a sweet host as was his sweet dog, enzo. he was full of great advice for bars and restaurants to check out in the area. the loft is absolutely beautiful and spacious. my wife and i especially loved the rooftop outside area for its great views of the city. it was a perfect place to have coffee in the morning or a glass of wine at night. the location was absolutely perfect and so close to many good bars and restaurants, as well as the bart. we will definitely be staying here again if we make it back to san francisco.as a frequent user of airbnb i must say this was a top 3 experience.  michael opened his home up to both anna and i and was beyond helpful.  he even drove me to my car in the morning for a jump after my battery had died.  he brought in breakfast, and the night i arrived we enjoyed a cheese plate and some wine.  then you go upstairs to the loft and are instantly in heaven.  everything was done with a purpose and the right purpose at that.  will not stay anywhere else in the city!we had a lovely stay at michaels- he was very welcoming and so kind, i wish i got more time to spend with him. the place itself, we really couldn\\'t fault- it was beautiful and we really enjoyed our stay. the location is great and i loved spending time in mission. thank you michael.incredibly beautiful loft with views and a gas fireplace in my favorite part of sf! better than a hotel. host was very welcoming and accommodating as we had a late arrival he placed a lockbox in front of the door. the listing is as accurate as can be, super clean and looks just as it does in the pictures. great decor and vibe in his place and the neighborhood around. his place is located right next to a ton of food spots, bars, just everything. me and my girlfriend were traveling throughout san francisco and stayed at multiple places and this was by far our favorite due to the culmination of the room, area, and friendliness of our host.what a lucky break to find ourselves in this airbnb gem. michael is a born sharing and caring host who opens his home wholeheartedly to his guests. it\\'s hard not to feel part of the family. the suite itself is an oasis and the location in the mission is center stage. michael will guide you every step of the way so you dont miss any of the numerous highlights in this colorful and vibrant san francisco neighborhood. this trip was truly thereal san francisco experience we had yearned for. thankyou michael, enzo and emmet! my husband and i traveled to san francisco for a short winter  vacation.  we could not have been more pleased with our stay at michael\\'s beautiful home.  beautiful space with plush amenities: comfy queen bed,  gas fireplace,  huge shower, 12 skylights, and cozy balcony giving you an amazing 360 view of the city.  the space is huge, quiet and serene.  michael was the best airbnb host: naturally positive and happy person who is always available to help if needed.  he gave us some delicious restaurant recommendations making our trip even better.  mission district is fun with laid back atmosphere.  home is just a few blocks from bart station making it easy to get around the whole city and to/from the airport. as an animal lover,  i was pumped about michael having a dog.  enzo is sweet and friendly... provides great energy to the space. he never barks (who knew that was possible for dogs) and is super chill.  i often stay at kimpton hotels because they have mascot dogs.  well,  enzo is the mascot dog for this place and he stole my heart.  we will definitely be back.  way better than any hotel we could have booked.gorgeous room. very private because you get the top floor of the house. it\\'s clean and has a generous amount of private space including an adorable deck with an amazing view of the city. lovely little details everywhere in the unit. lots of light. in your space you have streaming pandora and a flat screen tv with appletv, separate office area with a couch and desk and mini fridge and keurig. \\n\\nthe bathroom is so lovely. rain shower with a little skylight and bamboo shower floor. toilet is separate space from shower/double sink area. \\n\\nbed was super comfortable.  i was only here one night but i was thoroughly impressed with how quiet it was and more importantly how dark the room was once i shut the lights off. i didnt need my travel earplugs nor eye mask. \\n\\nwifi is fast. i measured with an app and speeds were well over 50 mbps.\\n\\nmain common area is amazing as well. i was here for a conf but i wanted to hang out in the kitchen all day and read magazines. \\n\\nhost was definitely a superhost. extremely cool. helped me with my luggage up all the stairs. we chatted up a storm. hes well traveled and a great story teller. he had awesome recommendations wrt food and drink places. he was also kind enough to give me a ride to my next destination (i had a lot of luggage).\\n\\nenzo, his dog, was even more gorgeous.  so pretty! \\n\\nneighborhood is awesome. \\n\\ni will definitely come back when i have more time and hide from the world by vegging out in this tiny little paradise the host has created with his own two hands...though it was short we had an amazing first air b&b experience at michael\\'s. the mission loft is full of natural light which complimented all of the attention to detail.. not to mention the best patio view that would beat many top rated hotels in sf. there\\'s so much character in this home to appreciate! michael as a host is everything you\\'d hope for and more, he felt like someone you\\'d have already known for years -- or at least wish to! there\\'s a great variety of restaurants within walking distance which we loved. we definitely are hoping to be able to book another (longer) stay.michael is a lovely person, who made us feel right at home. he gave us useful tips on what to do and where to eat during our visit. it was a real pleasure staying with him to get a feel for living in san francisco. michael was most accommodating. loved his dog, enzo! the loft is elegant, and private. coffee is provided, and deck is a must-see--terrific views. highly recommended.always such a pleasant stay!michael is an amazing host. he truly makes you feel

highly recommended.this was a great stay and way to short. michael is an amazing host... it was as if i was family. i cannot to head back to sf for more great nights in the city.michael was an excellent host!  super easy to communicate with, he texted to find out when we were arriving, and was very friendly.  the space is beautiful - just as pictured, awesome use of space, view from the roof was incredible, and it\\'s right in the middle of great restaurants and bars in the mission.  would definitely stay there again.it was our best stay in san-francisco ever. michael was so sweet and kind, that we couldn\\'t imagine. his aparts are much better than you can see on pics and it\\'s totally perfect, from fantastic bathroom to bedroom and patio, where you can see whole city as it\\'s on your hand.   location is in the heart of mission, a lot of restaurants and bars around. everywhere you can go by foot, we didn\\'t touch our car for two days. if you go to san-francisco -

everything about it, from the gorgeous patio(with a good view of the city)to the rain shower. wished i could stay longer and i\\'ll definitely stay here again when i come back! and enzo is super lovely! thank you michael, for an unforgettable stay. for us it was the first airbnb experience and it motivated us to do many more. since staying with you we actually haven\\'t stayed in a hotel anymore. we very much liked the location in mission. friends told us that we should rather live in north beach or russian hill. we have seen all districts and we are more than happy that we stayed in mission. what a cool district - with so many cool bars and superb restaurants. even the boutique stores are so different what we know from europe. \\r\\n\\r\\nmichael is a great host. the communication with him can\\'t be better. whenever you contact him it only takes seconds until he answers. his knowledge and experience is also worthwhile. he has seen and travelled the world and therefore knows what a tourist in san francisco is looking for. whatever he said or recommended, he was right!!! \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apparment is spacious and we liked that we had a bedroom, a living room and a desk. not speaking about the big, light and modern bathroom with the nice amenities (which were blocked by my wife most of the time). however, the best was the roof-terrasse with the view on san francisco, where we had our coffee from your coffee machine in the morning and the food you provided to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe also liked your dog (enzo) a lot. he gave us so much love by just visiting us when you were not there.\\r\\n\\r\\nmichael, thanks for your hospitality and we can only recommend your place to everybody who is considering to stay in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nyours,\\r\\nyvonne &

beautiful space! we were so impressed with the detail and design that was put into the loft. it was clean and even nicer than the pictures. we arrived with background music playing and we loved having access to the rooftop deck, gas fireplace and apple tv.  we stayed for two nights and we were pleasantly surprised that a cleaning service came to clean the room in between. in the two brief times we ran into michael he was super friendly and helpful and recommended a great local brunch spot. perfect location if you\\'re looking to explore the mission. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall great experience, would highly recommend it!couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to close out our trip to san francisco! the house is exactly as listed, and is a really gorgeous space to live in and relax. also, enzo the dog was an incredible sweetheart. everything that we wanted and needed was provided for, and michael himself was a kind, considerate and friendly host who made himself available for our questions and did his best to accommodate our schedule and check-in/check-out times. overall, can\\'t recommend this highly enough. the neighborhood is also very cool, with amazing places to eat in. ask michael for recommendations! :)michael\\'s loft was amazing. very private and unique space. it was just what we needed. the outdoor space was great for entertaining my friends. i look forward to staying there again when i returnwe absolutely loved our stay! the room is beautiful and view at night is breathtaking. michael left us fruit and yogurt for a hearty breakfast which we quite enjoy aswell. we wish to stay longer next time!this space is exactly as it looks, even better.  the view from the balcony was a special treat.  thoughtfully stocked fridge, fruit, coffee, bottled water, and even bedtime chocolcates.  michael is the ultimate host, interested and friendly, but also gives privacy when wanted.  best airbnb experience we\\'ve ever had.  michael was a great host, super friendly and knowledgable about the city. whenever i had a question prior and during our trip, he was no more than a text message away and was so quick to respond. the apartment room is clean, spacious and beautifully decorated. me and my boyfriend love the mission in san francisco, and would love to stay here again! it\\'s central to so many restaurants, bars, shops, and public transportation. no need for a car. really a perfect airbnb experience! michael\\'s mission loft was absolutely a perfect place to stay and explore san francisco.  the space was beautiful and clean.  the outdoor deck was awesome; pictures cannot do the view justice.  michael was incredibly kind, hospitable, and knowledgeable of the surrounding community.  highly recommended and cannot wait to return!couldn\\'t have been happier with the loft and host michael. he was incredibly welcoming and gave great advice and recommendations for food/drink and activities. the loft is unbelievably gorgeous and the area is the best in the city. walking distance from delicious coffee shops, restaurants and parks without the crazy hassle of tourists and cars. will hopefully stay in the loft every time i come back to san fran. we loved our stay at michael\\'s loft in san francisco!  it\\'s an incredibly bright and beautiful space located in the heart of the mission district.   there are lots of fantastic restaurants, cafes, and cool retail stores in the neighborhood. the loft is super clean with more amenities than a posh hotel room.  super comfy bed, soft bedding and towels, gas fireplace, flatscreen tv with access to netflix and apple tv, pandora, wi-fi, outdoor deck with gorgeous view of san francisco, amazing rain shower, etc.  we were so impressed with michael\\'s attention to detail!  he is a thoughtful and gracious host who provided cereal, granola, a keurig, and a mini fridge filled with assorted drinks and snacks.  there are also travel guides and lots of food and home decor magazines to peruse.

work if you have to in the sitting area. we had a great week at the mission loft. a perfectly sized attic apartment above michael\\'s place with everything we needed to explore the city. \\na 5 star experience. michael was out of town when we were there but emmet and stephanie were really lovely and couldn\\'t be more helpful. michael too was first class in his correspondence and ensured we settled in without any problems. the\\nmission district is also a few stops on the bart out of town, which was fine for us. the area also has an abundance of restaurants, bars and coffee shops which are worth exploring. my most recent trip to san francisco to celebrate my birthday was one of the best times i\\'ve had in the city. my accommodations at michael\\'s loft were a big reason why\\r\\n\\r\\nthe photos posted are beautiful, but the reality is nothing short of spectacular. the loft is airy, spacious and modern with million-dollar views of the city. even from the bathroom, which also has an awesome rain shower. \\r\\n\\r\\nif you can tear yourself away from the city views off the private rooftop deck, an hdtv mounted in the bedroom area offers hulu, netflix, or access to your itunes account through the apple tv.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe loft could not be any more centrally located in the mission. some of the hottest restaurants, bars and shops in the city are within an easy walk. the area is also well connected to muni and bart. of course, uber cars are everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nmichael is a warm and gracious host. he immediately made me feel welcome by leaving a birthday greeting and bottle of bubbly.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ll never stay at another hotel as long as the loft has availability. i\\'ve already booked my next trip!our stay with michael was exceptional and one of the highlights of our holiday! there is no better place to stay in san francisco in our opinion. michael is the ultimate host, he is very knowledgeable and friendly and made sure we had everything we

amazing host, if you are looking to stay off the beaten path (way off) be sure to stay at this gorgeous loft. great food, bars and the best chinese you will ever eat is only a block away at mission chinese. once again, air bnb has reminded me why i would choose an experience like this over a hotel any day of the week!this loft wasn\\'t everything i thought it would be...it was more! it was breathtaking to see the pictures of the loft come to life! the interior design is absolutely  immaculate! but what really blew my mind is the things you don\\'t see in the pictures ... welcoming

coworker and i truly enjoyed our visit. michael left detailed instructions for us to easily access his place as he was not there when we arrived due to a prior commitment. he had many extra touches such as fresh fruit and wine and a nice note to greet us. his place is beautiful and comfortable. he and his sweet dog greeted us the next morning and recommend places to see and eat and even offered to walk us part of the way. the neighborhood was a lot of fun. i highly recommend staying here and hope i get the chance to return. great hospitality. thanks!gorgeous place. michael is a natural interior designer.michael\\'s space is beautifully designed, clean, modern, and relaxing.  the location was the perfect base from which to explore the mission, close to many restaurants, stores, and the park.  what made the stay especially memorable however, was michael himself, who is an exceptional host. he has taken great care to think of every detail and amenity to make our family feel at home.the mission loft is hands-down a 10/10.  the location is wonderful and within steps of unique restaurants, pubs, and local boutiques.  the space itself is superb.  large skylights,  warm fireplace, and rooftop patio with views of the city will immediately make you feel like a true san francisco native.  even better than the space: the host, michael.  his hosting theme is simple - make everyone feel like a friend.  from the way he left a bottle of wine for us to our great conversations, our short trip to the mission loft will not be forgotten.  beautiful room in a beautiful home. staying in this loft was a wonderful experience. i would recommend to any of my friends looking for a nice place in the middle of a vibrant part of the city. michael was a great host and really helped us find some memorable bars, restaurants and activities to experience to make our short stay one we\\'ll never forget. michael was amazing and his space is beautiful! we felt very welcomed and special. the patio was great when the sun was out, and all the details of the place such as fireplace, lots of towels, cleanness and coffeemaker made the stay perfect. we will definitely come back!simply put, michael is an exceptional host. he was timely, incredibly interesting, a great conversationalist, and very focused on making the stay feel as comfortable for me as possible. anytime i needed something, he was there to swiftly provide and answer. michael greeted me with a fully stocked loft (wine, water, snacks, fruit, etc). the listing was even better than advertised!mission loft was absolutely beautiful and clean! michael was a great host and very helpful. we have a 3 year old daughter and he was very kind in making sure she was safe. she is very well behaved and felt very comfortable and loved his dog. we will come again, we fell in love with mission loft and san francisco !we had a fantastic stay with michael. the space is clean, spacious and beautifully decorated, with amazing views of the skyline via the private terrace. michael was so generous with his time, knowledge and home, and made our stay so memorable and comfortable. we could not recommend this space highly enough  as it is in the perfect location in the mission, walking distance to all the best cafés, bars and restaurants and with such a caring host. michael was the perfect host. he made sure that i had everything i needed. i\\'m still in awe that he has such a beautiful, special oasis in the heart of the mission! i definitely want to stay again, no question. the location is amazing and where i\\'d want to stay if i had a choice of places in the mission. our stay was absolutely perfect! the space was beautiful, location was very convenient and we had a great time getting to know michael. he was extremely accommodating and suggested a handful of amazing restaurants and shops to visit. can\\'t wait to stay here again!this was my second stay and i\\'m looking forward to coming back. i wouldn\\'t want to stay anywhere else in san francisco. thanks again, michael. you\\'re the best.michael was an amazing host! this was my first airbnb experience, and it will certainly not be my last. when we arrived, michael was very welcoming. he had water, wine, music, and a big smile on his face! he gave us a quick tour, and a lot of history about the neighborhood. it was pretty awesome. he made us feel right at home, and i almost wish we saw more of him during our stay! the  loft was super clean. the pictures don\\'t do it (url hidden) all! the house is off of the main streets, and the loft is very private. the deck is amazing, and there are some great places to eat right around the corner. parking can be a pain, but that\\'s san francisco..or any major city really. michael gave us some info on a great parking structure near by, that helped a lot. san francisco is the kind of place you want to lyft around anyway. i can\\'t say enough nice things about this place, stay here!michael made me feel right at home. he received me at 1.30am and even carried my bag for me all the way up to the loft.\\r\\n\\r\\nas soon as i arrived i had two sets of slippers waiting for me. he had a wine bottle, wine glasses, large perrier bottle, a beautiful glass bottle of water, and two water glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\nin addition, he had stocked the refrigerator with beer, cheese, and wonderful greek yogurt. he also had a container of granola, and some tasty crackers, in addition to a coffee machine, plates, silverware.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe listing was even better than it appeared in pictures. the bathroom is beautiful. michael had even set some fresh flowers in a vase in  the toilet area. the terrace is unbelievable!michael is an amazing host!  he called me once i arrived to make sure i was all set and had everything that i needed (since he was traveling).  he has a nice list of local restaurants, coffee shops, etc, and his space is very welcoming + cozy.\\r\\n\\r\\ni also enjoyed the location.  and a side bonus - i practice bikram yoga and there was a studio a block away :)we had a wonderful stay with michael in his beautiful home. the loft is separate enough to feel private, while still having access to the other parts of the house if need be. the loft area is beautifully decorated and has all the amenities you\\'ll need for your stay. michael truly goes above and beyond.\\n\\nthe location is fantastic right in the heart of the mission, with great restaurants and coffee all around. we mainly took uber around the city but the bart station was a quick walk away. \\n\\nmichael is a gracious and wonderful person who truly wants to get to know his guests. at the same time, he is completely respectful of one\\'s privacy if you want to be left alone.\\n\\nrun, don\\'t walk, and stay here! it\\'s well worth it.we made a very last-minute booking and michael was super-responsive, literally responding to my inquiry within minutes. \\r\\n\\r\\nmichael\\'s apartment is chic and tastefully designed. i loved the shower, it has some sort of wood or bamboo floor and a huge shower head. tons of little accents, abundant light but easy-closing blinds on every window. the view of the city from the little balcony is spectacular. i found the bed to be extremely comfy, which is rare for me. it felt like some sort of feather bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nmichael is really friendly and knowledgable about the city. i wish i had more time to talk to him but when we arrived we were exhausted and immediately fell asleep. we had a little chat in the morning in his kitchen which is also a spectacular space.having been to san francisco and visited all the touristy tropes, we were looking for a different experience and an opportunity to really experience the city.  that is exactly what we got and more.  what an amazing experience.  the space is thoughtfully designed, clean, modern and well suited to afford guests privacy via the staircase that separates it from the rest of the house.  particular highlights are the luxurious bedroom and the balcony which offers an amazing view of the city.  but the beauty of the space is dwarfed by the hospitality of it\\'s host.  meeting michael and getting his insights into the city was the highlight of an amazing weekend.  he was thoughtful, going so far as to provide a bottle of champagne with which we toasted our anniversary under the stars out on the balcony.  his insight into the city and how best to traverse it made a huge impact upon our trip.  seeing michael\\'s passion for his city and his neighborhood really helped us kindle a love for the city.  while there are many great places to go around the city, with michael as your host you could never leave the mission district and not only have an amazing trip but leave with a list of things to see and do next time.  it\\'s these personal touches that made our experience truly one of a kind.the mission loft was something i could only dream about. the view of downtown was to die for and bathroom and bed were more comforting than the warm sun on your face in the morning but the best thing about this airbnb is michael, courteous, good sense of humor, down to earth and a dam good interior designer. if only i could convince him to let me rent out the space indefinitely, but alas he enjoys the frequent new company as all wonderful hosts do.\\r\\n\\r\\nuntil i stay here again, my significant other and i will dream about this loft in the mission.micheal made us feel so at home and he was super helpful, his loft is beautiful and the added bonus of the roof terrace was amazing. the space was really well appointed, we had every thing we needed and there were some lovely touches.a lovely space and lovely host! we had a wonderful time at michael\\'s place in sf. the location is perfect, the space is beautiful, and michael is super nice. as always, michael is warm, welcoming, interesting and interested. his place is awesome; spotless and impeccably designed.michael is the most welcoming of airbnb hosts, making us feel right at home with his warm introduction to the local area, through to an invitation to join a dinner party he was hosting. the private loft (in michael\\'s home) is very chic and comfortable, and the location in sf\\'s mission district is great. highly recommended!this is an absolutely beautiful loft. michael is wonderful host and has built a place that is even more impressive than the photos suggest.arriving tired from a long flight and then to receive such a warm welcome from michael was the perfect start to our stay in san francisco. the loft is great, beautifully designed and located in what we found to be the most interesting and vibrant part of the city. michael is a fantastic host, knowledgable and welcoming. stay here with confidence, you won\\'t want to leave...michael\\'s upstairs loft is better that you can imagine! the view from the private deck is spectacular, the style is modern but comfortable, the location is ideal for being in the mission.micheal was the perfect host, he even carried my very heavy bags up the stairs. the apartment is effortlessly chic and with wonderful views and even a bottle of wine :-) its in the most fantastic area and close too amazing restaurants and bars. my stay was so relaxing, chilled and i felt very very safe. \\r\\nemmamichael is a wonderful host and has built a place that is even more impressive than the photos suggest.  michael was very warm and hospitable and took the time to make sure my stay was the best it possibly could be.  michael loves to host and meet new people he really is a super host.  i enjoyed being in a space that is alive and welcoming. michael has a beautiful home and everything in the space has special meaning to him which made it feel so cozy and special.  the neighborhood has some delicious restaurants in walking distance and you really get a great feel for the culture and the community.  hope i will have the chance to visit again.  michael was the perfect host, and the \"mission loft\" the perfect location from which to explore the city. highly recommended if you want to experience san francisco like a local, away from the touristy bustle of union square. the room is very large and convenient, and the rooftop area is the cherry on the cake. highly recommended!super host. probably the best airbnb i\\'ve ever stayed in. host was able to be flexible on when to meet and when to check out. the room was the entire top floor. beautifully furnished, great facilities, impeccably clean, a complementary breakfast, a coffee machine, and a bottle of wine on arrival. michael mentions height of the ceiling in the ad - my brother was 6\\'3 and he had no problems with it.our stay at michaels place was perfect in any way. first off, the place itself is breathtaking; furnished and decorated with great attention to detail. our personal highlights were, without a doubt, the wonderful shower as well as the private deck with a stunning view of the city. the location is perfect to explore the city and experience the vibe of the mission district with its countless restaurants, bars and coffee shops. michael was a fantastic host. he was very flexible with check-in and gave us a great, personalized introduction to the city. he is very bright and warm-hearted and made sure that our stay was the best it could possibly be. definitely stick with his recommendations if you want to explore sf like a local! we would have loved to stay longer and will definitely be back! highly revommended!i\\'m always a sucker for a nice view & good design. this listing has both! i felt extremely comfortable and at home in michael\\'s listing. he\\'s fun, passionate and good natured. listen to his food recommendations, the man knows what he\\'s talking about! highly recommended. great ambience, and chill music upon arrival. i\\'m an explorer by nature, but the space was so nicely designed it was hard to leave! way better than any hotel experience you\\'ll have. exceptional value! \\r\\nmichael was an amazingly friendly host, and his place was above and beyond any expectations - i\\'m jealous! everything worked out super smoothly and i\\'d stay at his place again without hesitation.my boyfriend and i stayed at michael\\'s loft for two nights and could not have been more satisfied with our experience. michael was hospitable and very accommodating - taking time out of his personal schedule to make sure we were situated and taken care of always. the loft itself is stunning, very cozy with all of the amenities needed, while still being luxe and really gorgeous from a design aesthetic. we can\\'t wait to come back to sf and stay at the loft again! highly recommended. michael was a great host and the space was exactly as advertised. it was the perfect space for a quick visit. he had everything we needed to get checked in, settled and be comfortable. the rooftop deck was amazing and the space itself was beautiful. highly recommend!only got one word for this and it sums up our entire stay; fabulous love love love! michael made it so easy for a great trip. the mission loft feels like a boutique hotel with a b and b welcome quality. i can\\'t say enough about the hospitality and overall awesomeness of the loft, the host, and the location. just great.we only had one night in michael\\'s magnificent loft but we loved it - he even provided a bottle of wine for us to drink out on the deck. we loved the decor, curtains and wooden furniture and michael made sure we were very comfortable in the space. the mission district was our favourite part of san francisco and is right on the doorstep. couldn\\'t fault the place, just wish we had longer! and thank you for all the suggestions michael, they really helped us see parts of california we otherwise wouldn\\'t have! hope to be back soonthis place is fantastic. has amazing views of the city, a nice rooftop deck, tons of space. i really enjoyed staying here and would absolutely stay here again. it was lovely. michael would have to be one of the most informative and charming hosts i have experienced with airbnb. on our loft  rooftop deck overlooking san francisco (very unusual to have this ) he explained the social structure of the city and where we should (and shouldn\\'t) go. michael is so relaxed with his lovely house and has a genuine interest in his visitors without being in your face!! there was no problem leaving our bags on the last day as our flight did not leave until much later than check out. \\r\\nenzo the dog is not for sale, we wanted to take him home being the perfect dog!\\r\\nthe guidebook recommendations are perfect and we only managed to get to about half of them. they are the coolest and best places to go visit.\\r\\nsome have mentioned the low roof but my 6ft son and i had no problem with this. the loft design is more spacious than the photos suggest and yes there are stairs but michael helped with my heavy bag and this is san francisco....stairs and hills. it was very clean with a glorious shower and everything you may have forgotten!\\r\\nit\\'s really easy to get into the central city ( if you have to!) with uber or public transport. \\r\\nit\\'s quite hard to explain what a special listing this is that opens the door to a true sf experience from such a lovely host. \\r\\nthank you michael ! it doesn\\'t get better than this host, this location, this style, this vibe. highly, highly recommend. thank you michael for your hospitality and for inviting me into your abundant world. i\\'ll be back again!michael is an excellent host and among the best experience i have had with airbnb. the room is even better than it shows on the listing. it\\'s private, spacious and in a great location close to local shopping and restaurants. michael went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable and easy, he is accessible, informative and gracious in giving a history and background of the place and the area. the room was well equipped with everything you need and more. michael has great communication and made everything as easy as possible. \\n\\ndefinitely a top choice in the area and i highly recommend!! michael\\'s space was dreamy--the perfect retreat in the middle of the city. the location is amazing--right in the heart of one of san francisco\\'s most exciting neighborhoods with tons of restaurants, cafes and bars around. the apartment itself is exactly as pictured--bright, clean and beautiful. the little private deck has a beautiful view of the city and is the perfect chill-out spot. i highly recommend and will book again!michael has done an amazing job of creating a beautiful, stylish, comfortable and private space in one of the most interesting and exciting neighbourhoods in san fran.  we loved everything about our stay and this apartment played a large part in that by allowing us to integrate into the city\\'s amazing architecture and style and giving us proximity to explore so much of city. michael was a warm and gracious host who took the time to give us so much useful information and made our stay unbelievably comfortable.  a wonderful experience! our experience at michael\\'s loft in san francisco was amazing...our bet airbnb experience thus far. he welcomed us into his home and gave us a ton of information about the city, including his recommendations on where to explore, restaurants, bars, etc. the loft is even nicer then it appears and pictures and had everything we needed. enzo (his dog) is awesome too. will definitely return if coming through sf again.michael\\'s apartment was just perfect for my parents. matches everything you see in the pictures. i don\\'t think they expected to use the outdoor space so much--they could sit out there and read all afternoon with great views of twin peaks and the downtown skyline. the mission is definitely off the tourist track with wonderful restaurants and bars, but a 20 min taxi will get you anywhere in the city. highly recommended. the location of the loft is perfect! it is just blocks away from valencia street and a short trek to the castro...and basically anywhere you want to explore. i would absolutely stay here again! it is beautiful, clean and modern. michael is a delight too!!! aside from the fact that michael\\'s loft is beautiful and in a great location, michael himself is a wonderful and gracious host.  although we didn\\'t have much interaction until the very end of our stay, it is obvious that michael cares a great deal about ensuring his guests have a great time in san francisco and feel welcome.  we arrived very late at night (which michael was very accommodating about) and upon entering the loft we immediately felt at ease and comfortable-- relaxing music was playing, the private rooftop deck\\'s lights were on and yummy snacks were on hand.  the mission itself is a wonderful neighborhood with many great restaurants, bars, cute boutiques and street art to look at, all within walking distance from the loft.  this was my first air bnb experience and now the bar is set very high!michael has a well appointed space ..perfect for a weekend in the city. close to public transportation and walking distance to great shops and restaurants in the mission district.  make sure you ask michael for recommendations as he is very knowledgeable about the area.  the space was light and bright, unbelievable views of the downtown from the deck, and a beautiful shower to enjoy after a long day of exploring the sights.  i would highly recommend to anyone traveling to san francisco! michael was simply amazing! he was very  flexible with our check in & out times. this space is simple amazing. the snacks he left were a pleasant surprise this was our 1st airbnb experience and we loved it! michael was the most amazing host - he couldn\\'t have made us feel anymore welcome! the loft is so beautifully done out, it\\'s private, light and airy, we really didn\\'t want to leave. it\\'s also in the perfect location - mission is not very touristy but close enough to explore everywhere else too. thank you for being so bloody lovely michael! xwarmest and very personal! \\r\\nperfect weekend in his amazing place!\\r\\nmichael has created the ideal place for discovering san fransisco. the place is spacious, clean and offers great views over the entire city. we felt very welcome and michael has made every effort to get us set-up to explore sf, including a deal on free bikes from a local store. we will definitively be back. the place was everything that we were looking for. comfortable, stylish and the balcony had wonderful views. michael was so great and helped me set up and surprise my girlfriend with a rooftop dessert. i couldn\\'t have asked for a better night. the apartment was exactly as pictured but the balcony was beyond our expectations - really lovely view of the city. he has impeccable taste and was the most congenial host we have come across, only surpassed by his dog enzo who welcomed us every time we came in and was generally a wonderful presence downstairs! michael went above and beyond as a host and was very warm and friendly. we liked his place very much and the location is excellent for a bit of culture but also perfect to get to attractions elsewhere.great! beautiful room, super welcoming host, stunning city view, unbeatable location. i can\\'t recommend this enough. my first airbnb experience. michael was extremely responsive and diligent. thank you for allowing us to stay in your home.michael is the ultimate host. and his surroundings are incredible. he is an artist and sees that every guests\\' needs are met. the penthouse is beyond description. it is everything imaginable to make your stay in san francisco perfect. the layout of the whole floor is amazing. there is a balcony that has incredible views and inside the the apartment is everything anyone could imagine. everything. i saw the sunset from one side of the apartment and then the moon was in the sky through the skylight in the night. incredible. and besides the accommodations, michael is personable and charming. he greets all of his guest with his friendly and loving dog. i cannot say enough praises for michael\\'s penthouse apartment. i highly recommend it to anyone thinking of staying in the city. you will thoroughly enjoy it, i guarantee. beautiful space in a great spot in the mission. michael was a great host and puts a lot of care and effort into making a beautiful and comfortable home. what a gem of a space in this wonderful city. our only regret is that we could not stay another day. the recently renovated, thoughtfully designed loft is like your own personal apartment in the mission district. lots of room, a spacious and modern bathroom, a large work area and - the best part - a private deck with expansive views of the city. the only caution is pack light because you\\'ve got to deal with stairs. lots of stairs. the loft is on the 4th floor, so you\\'ll be carrying your gear all the way up. but the space and the views are so worth it. and, with luck, you\\'ll get to share the company of your friendly host and his faithful sidekick enzo.michael\\'s place is great. it is clean , comfortable and inviting. well furnished and kept spotless. it is fully stocked with the essentials for a lovely stay. michael is a very nice, hospitable person who truly enjoys his guests. he is graciously available when needed, but never in your face. his dog enzo is my new buddy. if you\\'re staying in the mission district,  you would be hard pressed to find a nicer place.  thanks michael.  hope to see you again one daythe loft is great and michael is super welcome and helpful.michael was very easy to communicate with, and extremely accommodating. we found his space to be just as lovely as the pictures showed, and would definitely recommend him as a host. thank you, michael! amazing place, the location is prime, the loft is big and very comfy. michael was very friendly and accommodating,we felt completely welcomed by michael and at home in the spacious loft apartment.  it is as beautiful as the photos, with sophisticated  design details, well thought-out lighting, a comfortable bed and luxurious shower.  we also enjoyed the terrific common space and kitchen when we dropped by to make tea and have short visits with michael.   the neighborhood offers lots of opportunities for exploring and is not far from bart. michael was really nice and helpful. he assisted me in settling in and suggested me places to visit and how to commute. the place itself was spacious, cozy and neat. i would recommend this place to anyone.this was my first airbnb experience and michael and his home were a great first impression! he was super accommodating when we had issues with flights and arrival times, was helpful with restaurant and activity recommendations, and was a pleasure to talk to. the home was super cute, comfortable, and in an awesome location. michael is very nice and accommodating. the location of the house is great, with a lot of good restaurants near by. the loft is very spacious, and cozy.my mom stayed at michael\\'s for one night but i made the booking for her and was with her for check in. michael\\'s penthouse loft is a modern, bright, spacious, beautifully furnished gem with all the amenities one could wish for and a private terrace overlooking the city. mom texted me at night saying she didn\\'t want to go to sleep  because her airbnb was too nice not to enjoy more. \\r\\nmichael is one of the loveliest and most welcoming host i have met and even offered to accommodate me if i wished to stay with my mom! \\r\\ni would recommend michael\\'s place to absolutely anyone visiting sf. we really enjoyed staying in this airbnb- as it is located in the heart of the mission area - an area with great food, entertainment, sites & history. the loft itself is a large light filled space with a fantastic view! it contains a sleeping area with two large sitting areas (internal & external) & a beautiful bathroom , all well appointed. michael was a perfect host ensuring we had another terrific airbnb experience beautiful home, great host. we had a wonderful stay over christmas this year here. highly recommended. this was our 2nd time staying with michael and again too short of a visit. with many airbnb\\'s under our belt, i can say michael\\'s place is our favorite. great host, amazing loft, and killer location. we cant wait to come back and stay again soon!we stayed at michael\\'s place for a weekend in the city on my girlfriend\\'s birthday. our stay was fantastic! michael is a first rate host, very helpful in communicating before our arrival, and again as we coordinated on the actual day. the penthouse suite is exactly as presented on the posting, a great room and a comfortable homebase for a couple on a short city getaway.  the space is fun with it\\'s many unique features (including an awesome walk in shower!) the open layout left us wondering how hard it would be to do the same in our own home! we highly recommend staying here, and suspect we may do so again.we didn\\'t get to meet him but he left a bottle of sparking wine in the refrigerator for us. \\r\\nit\\'s our special day and the place was nice and many good food near by. \\r\\nin short david\\'s apartment epitomize the experiences away from home i cherish - inviting, clean, innovative and intuitive !!\\n\\n david was a gracious host and facilitated creating an epic weekend  san francisco i had a great time staying in the loft for three nights. well appointed and very quiet, gracious host and perfect location. i will be back!michael is a host role model- enjoyed his company, the listing and neighborhood all together. michael was a great host!! very prompt with communication:) loved his place was super clean and perfect for our stay!!\\nour trip to san francisco was everything we\\'d hoped it would be and then some. it all started with a wonderful place to stay and an amazing host. michael\\'s penthouse was exactly as he described and as depicted in the website photos. the location was absolutely perfect; easy access to the rest of the city and great bars and restaurants nearby. we felt so safe and comfortable that we were able to sleep soundly each and every night, which isn\\'t normal for us (normally we toss and turn the first night). the price was beyond reasonable for everything that we got and we are grateful to michael for having us. don\\'t pass on the opportunity to stay in this gem of the mission district.from russia with lovemichael is a wonderful host! we had a great time at his place. it is in a great location with lots of restaurants and things to do right out the door. we loved meeting his dog as well. fantastic place in the mission. close to everything. we loved it! michael was a wonderful host, very accommodating and welcoming. he and his sweet dog enzo got us settled in, and made us feel at home. we enjoyed the amazing balcony, with 360 views of the city, and lounge area, as well as the amazing grotto-style shower. delicious food and drink within 2 minute walk. excellent place to stay to get a feel for the mission district while having a quiet, private escape from the hustle and bustle of the street.if you\\'re well-traveled and think you\\'ve experienced it all, i recommend that you put this one-of-a-kind airbnb property on your to-do list and book some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nsan francisco is a city that should be embraced fully, and michael\\'s beautiful victorian in the mission district allows you to \"go native\" to explore all that the area has to offer. from an incredible variety of restaurants within walking distance, to the neighborhood\\'s history and character, and the ease of getting downtown for business activities, it\\'s hard for me to recall ever feeling the way i did after five great days here. \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ve spent considerable time in berlin, beijing, london, new york, chicago, la and other cities on business (and for pleasure) in both top hotels and short-term rentals. but san francisco, thanks to my airbnb stay, stands out in my mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nhighlights: let\\'s start with the actual space (fourth floor with its own private rooftop deck and lovely city views). then there\\'s the main bed and linens, which were first-rate. the futon on the opposite end of the space, plus l-shaped glass desk, wooden table, chairs and mini refrigerator were a nice touch and came in handy. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe bathroom with its two sinks and massive shower were on par with anything you\\'ll find on a 5-star hotel property. what was terrific from a design perspective were the strategically placed skylights. they allow natural light bathe the space, if you desire. a simple slide of built-in blinds can cut the light if you want to sleep late. \\r\\n\\r\\nnow, the intangibles that truly make a stay memorable: michael was fantastic. he welcomed me and my oldest daughter as if we were family. he provided tips and recommendations that proved invaluable. and he made us feel like we were the first ever to stay at his property. another unexpected surprise was michael\\'s dog, enzo -- an absolute prince. i think we made friends for life with michael and enzo. they are a great team.\\r\\n\\r\\na few other tidbits: getting around is easy. you can hoof it on foot in the mission. valencia street is more gentrified and hip than mission street. lucca\\'s on valencia and 22nd street is incredible. radish is a mere 2-minute stroll and offers gluten-free options. there are also several small grocery stores in the area as well. coffee? so many choices! i liked linea caffe on 18th. \\r\\n\\r\\ngoing downtown by uber or lyft is simple. i recommend you \"pool\" your ride to keep expenses reasonable during rush hour. you can also take the bart to the financial district or moscone if you like public transit. we drove up from san diego and parked in the city garage on 16th and hoff. it\\'s locked overnight and you can park there up to 7 consecutive days if needed. \\r\\n\\r\\ni have fond memories of my time here and highly recommend michael, enzo and this exceptional airbnb property. thanks so much for the hospitality and great experience!\\r\\n   absolutely awesome! michael is the best host, laid back guy, but cares a lot about your stay. just absolute perfect mix of letting you be in your place upstairs and also there when you need him. seems like a great guy to grab a beer with although we never had a chance as my girlfriend and i were just running around the whole time. because the place is also in the middle of everything. best location for any sf experience, central to everything and down the street to so much good mission food. also, i think even a small family could stay here, the loft really is pretty spacious and almost feels like your own apartment with the coolest landlord ever living downstairs. seriously, if you have the chance to stay here and its not booked up, absolutely can\\'t go wrong.michael was a great host, very welcoming. he communicated very clearly with us beforehand, so that we were prepared the day our trip arrived. the penthouse loft is super cozy and quiet despite being right in the middle of all of the action in the mission. the skylights and natural light in this place are amazing. the shower is deluxe and we had a great night\\'s sleep. we also appreciated the fireplace which was spot on for the rainy night that we were there. i also enjoyed the bose speaker with ipod setup, which was fun as we got ready for a night out. due to the rain, we didn\\'t get to take advantage of the deck, but it was a nice perk to this spacious accommodation. highly recommended!michael was a very nice and helpful host. he was away for a friend\\'s wedding the first night in our stay, but even while there, checked in with us to make sure we had arrived safely and ensured we were all set up. we texted him a few questions and he responded in a short amount of time. he arrived back in town the next day and we met up with him properly and had a quick chat. very nice!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is up at the top of the stair, and is very cute and nicely laid out. very clean and very comfy!great host, lovely place and very convenient location. booking process was smooth with clear instructions. the loft is very nice, modern with a view and a nice fireplace. good for 2 sleeping in different sections of the loft or a couple with one child. \\r\\nnearby bart. \\r\\ngood value for money. michael was awesome...  gave me a house tour, shared some inspiring stories and wowed me with his creative remodel.  would love to come back sometime. wow, what an amazing place to stay. michael was an amazing host, he gave us great recommendations on restaurants and places to check out. as well as places to stay away from. which made for a very amazing visit. your in the center of the mission district, a few blocks from dolores park, and a short uber ride from the haight and castro districts. but i must say, its very hard to leave this suite built for two, its cozy and modern and makes you ask yourself why your not living in san fran. would absolutely stay here again if i had the chance and i highly recommend you give it a try. thank you again michael for the amazing accommodations and hospitality. we loved michael\\'s loft so much - beautiful mix of modern and natural interior, filled with sunlight and breeze from the little windows - he has created such cozy space you just want to stay there and relax. it was so lovely to wake up in the morning to start the day with blue sky from the bathroom skylight windows. morning walk to a popular local bakery and nice coffee shops nearby was also enjoyable. our host michael was very generous and welcoming, and we really appreciated his kind help throughout our stay whenever we needed it. we loved having enzo around us, too! we rented bikes in the neighborhood, cycled to golden gate park, had smitten ice cream all recommended by michael and enjoyed it very much! we were happy we have found this place. thank you for making our stay special!michael welcomed us in with a cold drink and a lovely chat. he recommended some great places to eat in the neighborhood and made us feel right at home! beautiful loft with amazing views, would definitely stay here again!!! not a single complaint. from the initial checkin to the moment we departed, our stay was superb. stellar amenities with a spectacular view of downtown sf and a view of oakland bridge. amble supply of fresh towels, linens and toiletries. conveniently located near the mission and castro district that support several eateries and nightlife. thank you for a memorable stay!fantastic stay at this great loft in mission. michael is a great host, made us feel very welcome and recommended some great spots to eat and drink. the location for us was perfect, with lots of san frans best restaurants and bars in walking distance. the loft is big and bright, v clean. all in all a five star experience!the listing is exactly as pictured...and beautiful at that! amazing design and balcony views will make you feel immediately at ease amidst the city of san francisco. \\r\\n\\r\\nas if the beautiful apartment isn\\'t enough, michael is a perfect host. his welcoming nature, and knowledge of the area makes for the most ideal host.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy favorite airbnb stay to date, highly recommended :)this was my second time staying at the mission loft, and i have already booked a third! this gorgeous loft is in the best part of town, blocks from dolores parks and all the best restaurants. the loft is exactly as pictured - decorated beautifully, clean, and bright  - a perfect mission getaway. michael is a gracious host. can\\'t say enough great things about this spot.we were welcomed by michael, experiencing his enthusiasm first hand when he offered to carry our extremely heavy bags up the stairs, and greeted us with his home made bandanna bread. michael was helpful with any questions we had about the city and shared his local knowledge for us to come up with our itinerary.\\n\\nthe loft was nothing short of the description, capturing a romantic escape from the city. the views are easily seen from the balcony and the natural light fills the penthouse from all the sky lights. michael has filled the apartment with everything you need which made our stay extremely enjoyable. \\n\\nwhen you finally want to leave the luxury that is the penthouse, minutes walk away is a variety of restaurants and cafes, parks and public transport.\\nour only regret was that we didn\\'t stay longer! let me add one more voice to the chorus of high praise for the mission loft as well as for the host, michael: both were awesome.  the loft itself is very neatly designed, feels sweeping and elegant and very comfortable, and has effectively every amenity one could want (my fave was the deck).  michael is an incredibly warm and welcoming host with a really interesting story to tell (and i regret that my and my sister\\'s stay was too short to hear all of it).  i\\'ll hope to return to this listing down the line!this space was absolutely amazing. myself and my friend have never been to san fran before and were a little apprehensive but michael made sure we felt really settled and at home. the amenities were fantastic and the location is brilliant. the loft is right in the centre of mission which is full of bars and food places to try. dolores park is a must and is only a few blocks away. michael was the perfect host. so welcoming and inviting with lots of local knowledge. we also loved that enzo is an integral part of michaels home. we really felt like we were friends visiting rather than air bnb guests. we really enjoyed our stay and cannot wait to visit again!! xmichael is a great host and very accommodating. the space is beautiful and in a great spot in the mission. highly recommended!the loft is exactly as listed and even better, with all the lovely details put into the loft. the balcony gives a very nice view over san francisco.\\r\\nthe location is perfect and you\\'ll find all you need around and can transfer to down-town by cab, uber or bart.\\r\\nmichael is an excelent host, and welcomed me like a friend. he and his dog enzo made me feel home. michael was available for questions and it was very nice to exchange about life experiences. make sure to have a chat with him and just enjoy the location and the san francisco mission feeling.\\r\\nnex sfo visit - the mission loft!\\r\\nbest airbnb stay i had. i really often visit san francisco but it was the first time i really felt at home ! micheal is a great host, taking time to tell me about nice places around and discuss any topics. the house is gorgeous with unique pieces of design and the loft is amazing ! a great moment indeed. it was a fantastic room with a lot to offer! thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and made my visit to sf much more awesome :)what an amazing room!! we had the most amazing time staying with michael and enzo.  michael provided so much information on the surrounding neighborhoods as well as drinking and eating spots! communication with michael was so easy too, any questions we had or just having a chat...he was always available and so friendly! it seriously felt like a home away from home...the bed was super comfy too!! would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone wanting an oasis to come home to after exploring the many wonderful places that san fran has to offer!accommodation experiences don\\'t get any better then this! amazing place, fantastic host, perfect location!\\r\\n\\r\\nif you get a chance to stay with michael take it.this is a fantastic place to stay, and michael is a wonderful host. we arrived a bit early but he was happy to welcome us in and gave us loads of good recommendations for things to do and places to eat. enzo is the chillest dog in the world and it was lovely seeing him on a morning on our way out. the space michael has is amazing, the shower is huge, the roof terrace has sunshine and views and it had everything we could possibly need. michael even went out and bought a 4g to wifi dongle for his guests to use so we had free 4g when we were out and about which was really handy! definitely a luxury experience for airbnb. the area is fun and interesting, we explored it quite a bit and had some amazing food. would loved to have stayed longer.even though our plane was late and we probably delayed his plans for the evening, michael made us feel very welcomed.  he helped us with bags, made sure we understood how everything worked, and was ready to make more amenities available if we needed them.  we loved visiting with enso but if we had been uncomfortable, michael would have shielded our contact.  the space was beautiful, very comfortable, very private, spacious, and we would have been happy to stay much longer!  it was also very convenient for us to visit with family and walk to all the special places in the neighborhood.michael made us feel most welcome and welcomed us into his lovely home and provided us with useful and valuable information which made our stay memorable. michaels apartment is situated in a convenient and beautiful area especially for exploring the mission and castro areas. its a warm and cosy space ,with all the comforts and the rooftop views of san francisco were a real delight. michael was a friendly host and we would highly recommend his home to all. thanks again michael for a wonderful 4 days. jim @cathwhat a beautiful loft! michael was very welcoming and gave us all the information we needed, both before and during our stay. he has clearly put a lot of time and work to make this a great place to stay, and we loved the rooftop deck, the welcome bottle of wine and the room was clean and very spacious. lots of nice details, both in terms of architectural design and amenities. michael was very accommodating, would love to stay here again some time! a stylish comfy oasis in an authentic vibrant neighbourhood. close to all sites but off the tourist track for sure. michael was an ideal host-- great communication before, no problems arriving, friendly and available if needed.  the wine for a rooftop aperitif was a lovely touch.  a perfect spot to feel like a local in one of sf\\'s coolest neighbourhoods. this was our first experience using airb&b and michael\\'s welcoming attitude and amazing home were a perfect place to begin. the loft was like a private suite that came with an amazing view of sf! comp bottle of wine! beautiful space/ floors/ bed etc..excellent communication on arriving along with helping us choose how and where to spend our short stay in the city. good conversation over coffee the morning we left too! it was a perfect stay. if we come back to sf, we will absolutely find michael again. if not to stay with, then at least to have a beer with! what can we say this place is an oasis! a rooftop skyline, a bathroom fit for a king, all your music needs at your fingertips and a handsome host to give you all the tips of san fran, what more can you ask for!\\n\\nwhere you stay when you stay will always shape your experience, but what\\'s more, is the people you meet along the way. michaels place made us fall in love with san fran that little bit more but sharing life experiences with him over a glass of rosė made us certain we will be back!\\n\\nthanks michael. p.s we can\\'t put david deidas book down! :)micheal was the best host. he made us welcome and his place is wonderful. way to go!!!this is the most amazing place we have ever stayed. michael has perfected the art of airbnb-ing. he greeted us at the door, showed us to our beautiful loft, let us pet his lovable dog, gave us complimentary champagne and a quick walk through of how to make some tasty coffee. \\nafter that, the place was ours to enjoy the wonderful very of the city - twin peaks and downtown included! \\nthe loft had an ipod and speaker with all the musical needs you could desire, a way-too-easy-to-turn-on fireplace, and even an instax polaroid camera to leave more than words in the guestbook.\\n\\nthe loft was very well thought out and very clean.\\n\\nthe shower had room enough for 5 and was stocked with some very nice shampoo, conditioner and bodywash. there was even matches in the bathroom - michael knows what he\\'s doing. \\n\\nmy only wish was that we could stay longer - we will certainly be back. \\n\\np.s. we hope your date went well michael is the perfect host. everything was organized and to top it off he is a great guy ! \\n\\nthe accommodations were amazing. at night we sat out of the rooftop deck and enjoyed the skyline views. \\n\\nthanks michael (and enzo the perfect dog) and we look forward to visiting again!!\\n\\nall the best\\n\\njohn and paula i\\'ve been exploring various neighborhoods in san francisco via airbnb, and this, so far, has been my favorite, thanks in no small measure to emily\\'s wonderful hosting.  her place is clean and cozy with a warm fireplace near the couch, a perfect spot for reading on a lazy afternoon.  the bed is comfortable, and there\\'s a table in the bedroom to do work.  there\\'s also a small porch nested in this victorian, just outside emily\\'s living room, where you can sit outside and enjoy a tea each morning, which i loved to do.  it\\'s near haight street; it\\'s near cole; and it\\'s near golden gate park.  i highly recommend a visit to the nearby botanical gardens.  one day i ran through the park to ocean beach and returned on the n judah street car, which stops not far from emily\\'s place, which is convenient.  there\\'s also buena vista park nearby, where there are some amazing views.  emily helped me plan where to go running with a map she gave me of the local area.  she also invited me to join her and her friends for a christmas dinner, which was lots of fun.   i stayed with emily for nearly 5 weeks and i\\'ve loved everything about it! emily is a really nice and caring person who has done everything to make sure i enjoyed my experience at her apartment. as i was staying for a pretty long time, we found a good balance between a host/guest and a roommate situation. the flat is really nice, big and sunny. the room is comfortable, really good bed and an access to the back stairs. and it\\'s the perfect location when you want to discover an authentic san francisco and enjoy the really close golden gate park. \\r\\nit was my first airbnb experience and i couldn\\'t have had a better one, thanks to emily. \\r\\n\\r\\nemily has a lovely apartment flooded with daylight, close to the hubbub of haight street, yet set far enough away on a calm street.  she has an abundance of teas and enthusiasm for her city and is a gracious host.  she helped me map out an incredible run through golden gate park to ocean beach on the pacific; the highlight of my trip!i stayed at emily\\'s for two nights. the house and the room are perfectly described in the details. they are very cozy, clean and tidy. moreover, the place is well located in a very quiet area, but close to haights street, where you can find exotic shops and restaurants. emily is herself a gracious and considerate host, sportive and environment friendly.  for the people going to san francisco, i can only recommend staying in her home, and certainly will come back to hers if i have the occasion. emily was a fab host, and her apartment is even better than described. we had a lovely time, and she made us very welcome. we look forward to coming back soon!\\r\\n\\r\\neverything was as described and great. it\\'s a nice apartment and really fun neighborhood. i agree with everyone else\\'s positive reviews.  emily was more a host  than a shelter-provider.  the apartment is clean, cozy and very nice.  the area is great and near the park if you like to run.  i would certainly stay again.emily was a helpful, friendly, and flexible host. you get a nice big bedroom in a great location for exploring golden gate park, the haight, and hayes valley on foot. she had everything clearly laid out and organized in the house (e.g. you get your own half of the fridge), and she was nice about checking in with you to make sure you have what you need (e.g. very clear directions on how to get to and from the airport on the cheap, and she texted while i was in transit to make sure i was all set). i\\'d gladly recommend her home to any friend visiting sf.emily has everything in a great hostess i can imagine. she\\'s friendly, communicative, respectful and generous. the house is lovely, clean and quiet. the neighbourhood has everything i want, park, restaurants, bars, cafe, all within walking distance. emily went above and beyond to prepare not only the room, but everything i would need if i were a tourist wanting to explore the city. as a foreign worker who needed a place for the transition to a permanent home, emily offered me a place where i feel safe and comfortable. i highly recommend emily\\'s place for your next trip to san francisco.our stay at emily\\'s apartment was our first experience with air bnb and she made it unforgettable! emily is the perfect host: she responded very quickly to our reservation, emails and questions, was always willing to give us tips on where to go for dinner and what to visit, and her house is the perfect spot to discover san francisco. \\r\\nhighly recommended!emily\\'s home was the perfect spot for my san francisco adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was very near a lot of transit, and within walking distance to tons of cool spots. close enough to haight ashbury to feel the energy, yet far enough away to have a quiet, tranquil place to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room and house was possibly even more beautiful than it looks in the pictures, and emily herself was welcoming, warm, and full of great \"off the beaten path\" suggestions (just what i was looking for!).\\r\\n\\r\\nthis was my first shared home airbnb experience, and emily\\'s place was the perfect introduction to what i\\'m sure will be many more shared house experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\ni only wish we could have spent some more time together!\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks emily!emily is really the perfect host! she\\'s really sweet, and thank\\'s to her advises and her good mood she succeeded to sweeten my difficult start on sf. since i was here for one month, time to find something permanent, we kind had a roommate relashionship and i really liked to share discussions over food and wine. i highly recommend her as a host!\\r\\nthank you for these lovely times! :)\\r\\nthanks to emily and her beautiful home my first airbnb experience has been nothing but positive.  i travelled to the us to attend a retreat and was looking for a tranquil place to rest afterwards and also see some sights of san francisco.  the location is convenient to transport and many great places to eat in both vibrant haight st and quieter cole st.  emily also supplies a wonderful range of teas and fresh coffee to enjoy.  emily was extremely helpful in suggesting places to go and giving directions to a newcomer to the city.  i can highly recommend emily\\'s home as a peaceful place to explore beautiful san fransisco and would definately choose to stay there again on future visits. thanks emily!!emily was a very kind and uncomplicated host. because of her open and likeable nature you feel connected to her like a friend. she made us feel welcome in her nice apartment and she had very good ideas what to do and what to see in her hometown. we stayed here for the weekend of outside lands music festival. this apartment is very convenient to the park, haight-ashbury, and cole valley. everything was clean and comfortable and well-organized.haight-ashbury is awesome and so is emily\\'s place! we had a the best time here and emily is a perfect host - very open and helpful with insights about her city. i would warmly recommend staying with her and i plan on coming back.we had a great time and enjoyed not only the place but also the various insidertips! i can highly recommend this place especially if you want to discover more trendy facets of san francisco!emily was a fantastic host - kind, warm, easy to communicate with before my stay and during. i felt at home from the moment i walked in - even homemade bread waiting for me!  the house is clean, bright and in one of the best neighborhoods in san francisco. this was my first airbnb experience and it was really perfect. thanks so much emily!!\\r\\nsharoni do not even know where to begin! i could not have asked for a better experience. i stayed with emily for one month. i have to say i was nervous as i was a new airbnb user and new to san francisco as well, but i could not be happier with how my living situation turned out. emily was an incredible host. she was extremely welcoming from the start. she offered great advice on activities to do in the city including bike trails, fun activities to do on the weekends, and places to eat and shop. also her place provided everything i was looking for, great location with easy access to public transportation, a great porch to sit out on, friendly neighbors, etc. beyond all that emily is a wonderful human being and it was a pleasure to get to know her and spend time with her while i was out in sf. emily was a fabulous host, i highly recommend her to anyone who is considering staying at her place and i personally look forward to many repeat visits in the future :)staying with emily was great! her apartment and hospitality is perfect: quiet, clean, welcoming, close walk to public transportation and great food. \\r\\n\\r\\ncan\\'t wait to go back.emily\\'s house is a very typical \"painted house\" in san francisco, situated in the famous haight ashbury district, 5mins walk from the amazing golden gate park and its attractions (japanese tea garden, conservatory of flowers, etc). \\r\\nemily is so kind, helpful, providing you with clean linens and towels. she makes you feel like you\\'re at home and i really appreciated her mild-mannered presence and tactfullness.\\r\\ni would definitely recommend her place to go.\\r\\nthanks a lot emily! emily was a wonderful host--kind, helpful, smart. her place was sunny, clean, and close to everything. would definitely go back.i had a very good time in san francisco (although i came for work) where emilys beautiful and cozy apartment was a great place to rest from the hustle and bustle of the city. the place is very special, emily really has an eye for the detail. \\r\\nemily has been very helpful, friendly and easy-going!emily was very nice and accommodating. her house was clean and the room was spacious and homey. i will definitely stay with her again on my next trip to san francisco and would 100% recommend her to anyone else visiting the city.i really wanted to stay in a cute painted victorian while in sf, and emily\\'s place was a great fit.  it\\'s nicely painted, on a super cute street, perfectly situated just off haight street in a very convenient and easy-to-access location!  i stayed for one week and had a great experience--she is friendly and helpful, and the apartment is very clean, with a cute porch and lots of natural light.  the bed is extremely comfortable (i slept like a baby).  wi-fi is strong and works great, which was also very important for my trip! emily was a perfect host. from her thoughtful preparation of the room to her great tips about visiting the city, she was welcoming, always helpful and such a pleasure to be around. even though it was a hectic week of work for emily, she made sure communication was open and that jess and i had everything we needed. \\nthe house is so centrally located and perfect for any traveler who wishes to explore the city. so many cute cafes and shops just down the road, and getting to public transit is a breeze. the neighborhood itself is lovely. with beautiful golden gate park just a short walk/run away, i can\\'t think of a more convenient setting.\\n\\nwe had a wonderful time with emily and will certainly stay here again if we return to san francisco!\\nmy second stay in emily\\'s place was as pleasant as the first - perfect host, awesome apartment  and the best neighborhood in sf.debra was a fantastic host, i loved that she left video instructions via drop box for all of the appliances and how to work the shower faucets (something very helpful, think of time trying to figure out each shower on every trip).  the house was beautiful beyond words - pictures do not do it justice.  the views terrific.  we thoroughly enjoyed walking in the neighborhood and cooking at home with our large family of 6 for this trip.  i would not hesitate to recommend her as a host, and would highly recommend the location. debra was available for questions via email and very helpful both prior to the trip, and during when we had a minor question.  loved it.\\r\\nexcellent location with wonderful views of san francisco.  the house was incredible. excellent experience. house was beautiful and very spacious and comfortable. exactly as pictured. could not ask for a better host. all correspondences were prompt and clear. directions on how to use everything in the house was helpful and accurate. i would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to be in the noe valley/mission area. thanks so much to our host.debra is a wonderful, thoughtful host whose home is a beautiful oasis.  the house is even more gorgeous than pictured with a truly heart-stopping view.  debra had prepared everything one could have wished for or needed during one\\'s stay (we particularly appreciated the videos she had made to help make sure we knew how to operate the security system and various appliances).  the neighbourhood is great and has every convenience, with two whole foods nearby and numerous little boutiques, coffee shops and bookshops nearby.  we would love to stay again.  our family had a fantastic experience in this beautiful home and debra was the perfect host. she was very informative and helpful and left very clear instructions for both her home and the surrounding neighborhood. the house has stunning views; we would have been happy to never leave! but it\\'s also very centrally located and we got around san francisco with ease. it\\'s at the top of a huge hill but well worth it for the views. it\\'s very close to a well known park and great restaurants. we hope to return and enjoy this comfortable, lovely home. we had a fantastic stay in debra\\'s home. five weeks of glorious summer and everything was perfect for us. the house itself is immaculate and the garden was great for the kids with the rope swing. we couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay for our time in noe valley. the view of down town from the terrace is amazing. i would recommend this house to anyone and also noe valley which is lovely, especially good with kids. debra was a very helpful and friendly host and made sure everything was set up for us before arriving and was available if we needed her during our stay. she provided info about baby equipment and baby sitting options we could look in to.\\nwe would stay again without a doubt.debra\\'s house was beautiful. i would be happy to rent it again.debra\\'s place is one of the best i have seen on airbnb - tasteful, cozy, very spacious and really homy. special mention goes to spectacular views - as the place is set atop a high hill.  debra took really good care of us, communication was very easy and clear. next time i\\'d definitely love to stay here. this was absolutely 100% the best possible airbnb experience, both house and host.  i can\\'t fully describe how great this house is--stylish but understated, comfortable but with spectacular views, well-equipped.  debra is extremely organized, warm and welcoming.  i felt like i was a visiting family member.  i could go on and on.  it\\'s just amazing.it was such a pleasure to stay in debra\\'s beautiful house! we rented for a team retreat and loved every minute of it. debra was a wonderful host and made us feel right at home. highly recommended, hope to be back sometime, thank you debra!this place is truly charming and we can\\'t say enough great things. we loved everything about this home. overall, the place was really fantastic.\\r\\n\\r\\neverything went well with the house. i was greeted on arrival and given the tour and keys. the place was super spacious and fully stocked with everything we could possibly need (from the kitchen to the bathroom). the beds were comfortable and the location of the unit was really perfect- walking distance to loads of good shops and places to eat! at one point we forgot our key to the house and locked ourselves out. cam was there however to get us another key so we could get in. all in all a really great stay, and a place i couldn\\'t recommend enough!absolutely great place that lacked for nothing - from the kitchen to the bathroom, dane proved an exceptionally welcoming host in terms of providing foodstuffs and bathroom amenity. the beds were very comfortable and the furnishings made all the difference in the experience. would definitely recommend to others.dane and cam were very helpful in welcoming us to their home! cam waited for us to arrive at 11pm on the first night and helped us with the luggage up the steps. they also stocked the house with toiletries and food. dane came up to help us with the luggage on the final day (we needed it as my parents weren\\'t able to move them down the steps). i would recommend this place if you want something quaint and quirky. i was the first lucky airbnb-er at this spot, for my parents in their 70s. greg and family were amazing hosts. they were very responsive, answered to every need we had. the neighbourhood is quite central very close to chinatown, little italy, grace catherdral, union square and very close to the cable car line. it is an amazing find if you are a tourist...great, safe location. the place was spacious and clean. i would highly recommend this  spot. i am glad greg\\'s changed the pictures...because earlier pictures didn\\'t do justice to how amazing the place is. you have a view of the iconica transamerica and the bay bridge right as you step out. if you manage to go the roof, you have a great city view. the hosts also left us a ton of candy. you can be a guest or you can be domestic- cooking amenties incl utensils, washer and dryer, a jacuzzi and a cozy backyard to chill in. the hosts were kind enough to let us park in front of the garage...not sure if that\\'s a regular policy.our second stay in the apartment was just as good as the first.  thanks again to greg + geoffthank you greg, it was a beautiful apartment in a perfect, central location. greg was extremely welcoming and helpful, always responding to our queries promptly. we had a great stay thank you!truly amazing apartment, we had a great stay enjoying the amenites, especially the roof terrace and the hot tub. there is a lot of space, we were 6 but never felt cramped. needless to say the place was spotless throughout with clean towels and linen provided. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe main districts and attractions are all within walking distance. would recommend getting some form of transport in san francisco be it a travel pass or a rental bike.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts were great, really flexible, available even when on trips themselves. everything worked seamlessly which i really appreciate as a host myself. all in all highly recommended. greg\\'s place is fabulous.  it is centrally located between union square and fisherman\\'s warf, close to chinatown and a nice walk to \\'curvey\\' lombard st.  you are a half block to the cable car line at pacific and mason.  felt like a local getting off and walking up to \\'our house\\'.  greg was always available at booking and when we arrived to answer any questions.  go up to the rooftop at night and watch the new bay bridge lights change (neat).  take a look a hotel rates in san fran, you\\'ll see $320+- per night and that doesn\\'t include parking or tax.  greg\\'s place may just be cheaper if you stay for a few nights like we did (no tax and free street parking in front of his place) but you are getting a whole house to yourself (and it sleeps six!).  walk up to taylor st, turn left and have a great breakfast sandwich or burrito at cafe isabella.  a few more blocks on taylor to ala romana (half chicken was delicious) or nob hill cafe.  the cable car museum, two blocks on mason, is free and worth seeing how the cars get around.  we will book again with greg when we return to san francisco.the house was perfect for us and greg was a great host.  i could not have asked for a better experience.  the house is walking distance from fisherman\\'s wharf, chinatown, financial district, and union square.  i walked all over the city, and this was a good starting place.  it is comfortably furnished and the kitchen is well-equipped.  greg responded super promptly to me any time i contacted him.  i would not hesitate to stay at this place again if i return to san francisco.this place exceeded our expectations. it\\'s very clean, nicely decorated, and has an amazing rooftop view. the bedrooms are very spacious - it worked out great for our small group. we were able to walk to fisherman\\'s wharf and mama\\'s on washington square (the best brunch in town!). overall the place is in a good location and taxi to union square was pretty decent for four people. greg was really easy to get a hold of and was very helpful. if we ever return to san francisco, we would love to stay here again!it was a very nice place, it presented as advertised. we picked it for the location - near chinatown and also half way between the fisherman\\'s wharf tourist area and the market street / union square shops. it was a far better alternative than overpriced hotels in those areas.\\r\\nwe stayed here for 3 nights and wished we could have stayed longer!\\n\\nfirst, the decor is quirky and very interesting. beats a stuffy hotel room anytime. it\\'s also got access to a backyard and rooftop seating area!\\n\\nsecond , it\\'s also really well equipped with a big kitchen (and all necessary equipment), super comfy sofa and lounge chairs and lots of fluffy towels.\\n\\nthird, the location is great!  we walked to town easily from here (some slopes but that was perfectly fine)\\n\\nthe only thing to note is that the two bedrooms are side by side and separated by a thin glass door (with a curtain for privacy) so you might want to keep this in mind if you\\'re two couples wanting some alone time.\\n\\nplace was really well maintained and came with wifi too. greg also let us keep our luggage in the garage after we \\'checked out\\' and before our night flight which was a great help to us.\\n\\ndefinitely recommendedawesome house.  perfect location for our longer stays out in the bay area.  greg kept in great communication checking in on us.  house instruction and san francisco information was clearly written in a binder packet.  free wifi was a perfect amenity.  will definately be adding this spot to our favorites.  hope to be back soon.  thanks again greg.the access was easy. greg\\'s messages were timely and clear. the property was beautiful. the neighborhood was quiet and lovely. i\\'ll be marking this on my list of places to stay next time i\\'m in s.f.our stay at greg\\'s place in nob hill was terrific! he\\'s extremely prompt with any questions and made us feel very welcomed. the space is incredible and such a great deal. it\\'s in an ideal location with all of the amenities and a rooftop with a beautiful view. we hope to stay with greg next time we\\'re back in sf. we had a brilliant time at greg\\'s place. he was helpful and incredibly nice, the house is beautiful and in perfect condition. it\\'s in a wonderful part of town and really helped us londoners have the best stay possible. great value and somewhere i would 100% recommend.greg was and is a great host. he checked in with me periodically through the stay just to make sure i was enjoying the stay. the apartment was better than the pictures could describe, close walk to anything you need, plenty of towels, great kitchen and a view that can\\'t be beat. will be staying here again as long as greg will have us. this place is fantastic!!!!! just be sure to bring the key with you if you leave out the back door to the deck!greg handled all details quickly, kindly, & professionally.  the location was perfect, our group of six in town for only one night, walked everywhere we wanted to with views in every direction.  the rooftop was stunning and welcoming and the home provided everything we needed, including a soak in the hot tub!  thank you greg, we will return.greg is super responsive and helpful! anytime we had a question he replied immediately and even asked how things were going during our stay. the place is exactly as described and the other reviews say it all...amazing rooftop view and private access, good neighborhood, hot tub, we couldn\\'t ask for more! thanks greg! greg is an awesome host - very helpful, responsive and warm. the apartment is absolutely amazing and beautiful and very conveniently located. we loved our time there and had a very pleasant, restful stay. i highly recommend greg\\'s place for anyone visiting san francisco!the apt was in a great location - pefect for cable car rides and access to chinatown etc. loved the place..went there with my two kids and they had a great time too.\\r\\ngreg was fantastic. our plane was delayed and came in very late at night and he made sure everything was perfect when we arrived.the place was beautiful and greg was great with communication, getting back to us whenever we sent a message. he periodically checked in on us as well as we were staying here during the massive rain storm of 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only thing we wished were different was that the wifi was better. it is only available at the front end of the house and, being there on business, it was sort of frustrating have to sit in the hallway or someone else\\'s bed room to use the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nother than that, great space, great guy.greg was very helpful and responsive from the moment i booked the place. the home was better than expected and in a great location! greg was quick to communicate when we arrived with how to park and get into the apartment. it was a pleasure to stay here, the apartment had an amazing view, great jacuzzi, and nice kitchen.amazing stay at greg\\'s airbnb in nob hill! my parents and two sisters flew from southern california in to join me in sf (i was in town from ny) for the weekend and this was a perfect spot to stay. the place was exactly what we expected from the listing and comfortably fit 5 of us. \\r\\n\\r\\nneighborhood is great, everything we wanted to do was in walking distance (and it helped the we came on a 60 degree and sunny weekend). going up to the rooftop for sunset was one of our favorite things. \\r\\n\\r\\ngreg was quick to respond to all our communications, highly recommend him and this place!we are really glad that we stayed at greg\\'s place - it was lovely, and he was super helpful and communicative about our needs and questions.  the place was really clean and unique.    we very much enjoyed our stay at greg\\'s apartment in nob hill. it is beautifully appointed,

beautiful! the rooftop patio has an amazing view of the city and the hot tub added the perfect touch of luxury. extremely clean home with fully equipped kitchen. it was also a wonderful little walk away from northbeach food and shopping. greg was amazingly communicative and checked in with us throughout the trip to make sure we were always comfortable. i traveled with coworkers for the week and it was so fun to enjoy our evenings after long days of work in this beautiful spot.great stay for a short weekend trip. greg was quick to respond to questions around keys/parking and the view from the roof deck was very nice to have. the two bedrooms do share a large french door, and even though the glass was frosted over and there were curtains up, it doesn\\'t provide all that much privacy if you have two couples traveling together. obviously not a huge deal and it\\'s sf so that kind of setup is pretty much expected, but was just something you couldn\\'t tell from the pics online.this place was great.  quiet, comfortable, everything we needed was right there.  host was super attentive and responsive, and made the experience positive.  we really enjoyed the patio and hot tub, and will definitely stay here again!we really enjoyed our stay. the location was awesome and greg was really helpful with any questions that we had prior to our stay.\\r\\nwe walked to most places - though the

and helpful.greg responds to emails with the speed of lightening.  he was great, and available if we needed.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni was traveling for work so we weren\\'t in the apartment much, but it definitely met our needs.  the apartment is quirky.  the huge tv in the master bedroom is a giant plus.  the backyard was not exactly as pictured, as the patio furniture was a bit worn...but that\\'s not a huge deal.  \\r\\ngreat place to stay in san francisco, right in the middle of everything!  greg is very responsive and the place is just as described with a great rooftop view, you won\\'t go

responded quickly and was very helpful in finding places to go.i would recommend anyone going should stay in a home like thiswe had a lovely stay at the len family\\'s home in nob hill. the house is as you see in the pics with lots of character and has an unbeatable rooftop view that we enjoyed sunrise on. the location is convenient for bus and cable car and right next to chinatown for a quick

a great host, he was extremely attentive and helpful. the apartment is gorgeous and acted as the perfect home base when exploring san francisco. would definitely recommend this place to others.greg\\'s place is fantastic. perfect location and a wonderful apartment, plus the roof deck has one of the best views in the city. greg also replied instantly to messages i sent him. the whole experience was perfect.had an amazing stay in san francisco! the house was lovely, very clean, spacious and enjoyable to stay in. it was also in a fantastic location - great when you only have a few days in town as we did. greg was great and attentive host - would definitely stay again. greg made himself available however we needed -- he was quick and helpful in response to our text questions. the nob hill flat was spacious, comfortable, and provided a great base from which to get about san francisco. the roof deck provided a spectacular late night view with skyline from the coit tower around to the shimmering bay bridge. the living room and open kitchen provided a great place to chat in the morning and late evening. we found ourselves wishing to see photos of how the house was transformed into its current state -- might be a fun thing to add to the guide books. next time we come back, we hope to try nearby mason pacific which was closed due to a fire. the gallery cafe was a great coffee resource.this was our first airbnb experience. my wife and i were traveling with our three children between 19 and 29.  we would have been looking at 2 or 3 hotel rooms. having a two bedroom home with a sleeper couch and kitchen meant we could all be together, and it was more economical.\\r\\nfrom our first inquiry about availability to our questions about details, greg consistently responded almost immediately. his instructions for access to keys in a lock box were simple.\\r\\nthe home was exactly as described and even better than the photos.  the remodelled kitchen was beautiful and spacious with everything you would need, including coffee maker with lots of supplies which was a nice surprise the first morning. the adjoining family room was nicely furnished with a nice tv and wifi internet.\\r\\nthere is a ground floor backyard with furniture and a nice hot tub. the roof top deck has spectacular views of the city.\\r\\nthe two bedrooms were spacious and well furnished.\\r\\nthe entry has a door for this main floor unit as well as a door for the upper floor unit. but, the entire entry is secured by a locked iron gate at the sidewalk, so it feels very secure.\\r\\nthe location is great. if you like to walk, which is a lot of up and down in san francisco, you are close to chinatown, nob hill, union square and market street. if you want a little help, the mason street cable car line is half a block away going from fisherman\\'s wharf to market street.\\r\\nit\\'s an older home, consistent with the area, but very well maintained and updated. take that to mean that the bathrooms aren\\'t modern, but they functioned well for 5 of us over three days.\\r\\nwe would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an authentic s.f. experience in a great location.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy wife and i were traveling with our family and needed a place as a previous booking had cancelled. greg is very responsive to all inquiries almost immediately, which was great as this was our first airbnb experience. very easy instructions and appreciated the parking tips and very handy. the home is just as shown in the photos and the views are amazing from the rooftop deck. neighborhood is great and within walking or cable car distance to many area attractions. we would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an nice stay in a great location.host was very quick to answer our questions. listing was just as described and very clean. neighborhood was nice and safe listing was detailed and accurate\\r\\nperfect  for what my family of 6 needed for our time in san fran! great area to be in, and easy to park the car out front and leave it for the rest of our stay. greg had lots of information about the city and where to go!\\n\\ndefinitely will be back! a superb place to stay in san francisco. clean, comfortable and homely with the added bonus of an amazing roof terrace giving stunning views over the city. the location is perfect for access all over the city and you can park directly outside for free! i cannot fault anything about the place, greg is a superb, attentive host and we would love to return someday.greg was easy to communicate with and his apartment was exactly was described.  his dad lives upstairs and was very helpful.  we loved the hot tub and really made the most of it.  fantastic views from the roof terrace and comfy beds.  we had a couple of minor hiccups with the apartment during our stay but greg was very responsive in sorting them out quickly.  i would highly recommend this apartment. the home was perfect for a weekend getaway, the rooftop with beautiful views was the cherry on top! the neighborhood was the best in the city from what i saw during our stay. easy access to many attractions. the host was helpful and communicated in a timely manner! loved, loved, loved the balcony - such an awesome view and the weather was perfect that weekend for sitting out there - perfect spot to toast a new family engagement! greg was super responsive to questions, place clean - would absolutely stay there again!greg was very welcoming and communication was spot on, he always replied to any communication very quickly. the apartment was closer to china town than i expected so grocery shopping was a cable car ride away. but we found a supermarket between the apartment and nob hill quite close to the cable car stop. apartment was clean and quite well equipped. area very hilly so if you have problems walking this may not be the place for you. it\\'s flatter closer to the coast. but all in all a great holiday. thank greg.  jimmy was a great host and has a wonderful place! his loft was exactly as shown in the pictures. very clean and nicely furnished with everything you will need.  it is within walking distance to great restaurants, bars, shops, etc. in soma. i recommend his listing to anyone coming to sf! wilson is an amazing host, the hospitality of the place was similar to a 5-star hotel.  the apartment itself is spacious and very clean, with great roommates.  i would definitely return on my next visit to sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is also great to a lot of restaurants and bars.

 shared shower area was well stocked and \"home\" style as we coordinated the one bath with all the residence there.  this seemed to work out just fine too.  i would recommend this for the north mission district and south castro districts as all is within walking distance.  thank you ambere et al for a lovely and quiet visit to san francisco.  kimberlyambere was a great host, super friendly and really helpful. the apartment is in a good location  - really clean and a great size room. would definitely recommend. ambere\\'s place was as advertised.  we had a great time.  as soon as we arrived, she gave us a tour of the amenities and our room.  the shower was great, and included a health club style soap, shampoo, and conditioner dispenser.   the bed was very comfortable, and we slept very well while we were there.\\r\\n\\r\\nshe was very accommodating and gave us really good directions to get around town and especially for using the train to get to at&t park.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe would definitely stay here again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n great location and the description was accurate. despite feeling like the apartment could be in the center of the city, you can still get a nice and quiet night\\'s rest.\\r\\nambere was a helpful host who had much advice and experience around san francisco.\\r\\nwould definitely recommend!ambere was a very friendly and hospitable host.  the property is located perfectly - a block away from safeway and whole foods, near a few restaurants, and easy access to public transportation.  although the room was a bit noisy, it\\'s no more than what you\\'d expect in an urban environment.  i would stay again for sure!ambere was a perfect host and are offering a super airbnb in the middle of quiet sunny castro. it\\'s only a short walk away from nice parks (buena vista, corona heights) and a super bike rental place (on linden st). i can highly recommend ambere\\'s place to other folks in town.it was convenient stay, the room and the whole apartment was very clean an cozy. when we come back to sf we try to stay in amberes quiet sunny castro room again!i enjoyed staying with ambere and feeling like a local in the castro district. completely different to staying downtown in one of the cbd hotels. amberes place is well located, pubs, restaurants, and public transport. ambere was a generous host, her place is clean, comfortable, and well located. i would recommend her.ambere was very responsive and extremely welcoming. the room was comforting and quiet, bright when i wanted it and not bright when i needed to sleep. great location for a visit to my daughter. ambere was a lovely host and the location was perfect. she helped me get settled and directed me to an incredible burrito after my long flight. the house was very clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable i have ever slept in.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s a great neighborhood and my only regret is that i didn\\'t have more time to explore. ambere promptly replied and was helpful in a number of ways.  she sent detailed directions regarding the use of public transportation from the airport.  while she was away on business a couple of days, she made sure we had a contact person on site to answer questions respond to any needs.  also we found the bed very comfortable, slept well, and appreciated that the area was quiet enough to do so after 10 p.m.  i would choose to stay here again if available. (you may use this message but do not use my last name please)the place was wonderful! great location and i would definitely recommend staying there.our room was very clean and in great condition. thanks ambere!i did not meet ambere, as she was out of town, however, her emails made me feel welcome, and her partner himself hosted me. \\r\\nthe apartment is just 4 blocks from cpmc, the medical facility where my husband is recuperating, easily walkable and a wonderful cafe on the way. whole foods and restaurants nearby and a sweet safe neighborhood. shared bathroom, no problem, clean kitchen available. they are busy, sign up quick!i was busy working during my visit, so i didn\\'t get to socialize much.  ambere was friendly and very accommodating in our brief interaction though.  the bed was clean and comfy.  the neighborhood was cool.listing description was accurate. room was very nice, great bed. loved the neighbourhood, perfect for us as really close to grab a streetcar or bus and head off into the city or walk up to haight. they went out of their way to accommodate an early arrival and  we  really appreciate that. never met ambere but her partner and room mate took care of us very well.even if i didn\\'t meet amber she was always so friendly and helpful through texts and marcel gave me the keys and explained me everything. the house is in a wonderful position and it was very clean. the room is big and perfect both for one or two people.ambere\\'s place is in a great location! we were able to easily access many forms of public transportation and explore the city. ambere and her boyfriend were responsive via text and phone. we had to share the bathroom with other guests, but it worked out fine. we had a great time in san francisco. i enjoyed my stay at ambere\\'s place. the location was excellent and easy to get to all transit options. ambere was very friendly and helpful when i arrived. if i\\'m back in sf again for business, i\\'d book it again.great place, great people. very friendly and smooth communication, and, accommodating to my schedule. i felt welcome. i’ve stayed in sf many times, but never in this neighborhood. what a great location is this! it is quite city like but the actual location of the room is pretty quiet. i would definitely stay here again.the room was lovely, and the apartment is in a very convenient location. ambere and her roommate were friendly, and gave me lots of useful advice. had a great stay in sf in the quiet sunny castro room. the house is in a perfect location, ambere and her roommate were very friendly all the time and gave me very useful advices for sf. the room was clean, quiet, everyone very friendly and helpful. thanks for everything! definitely recommended! as advertised. simple, clean & a great location near castro. \\r\\nthanks ambere!ambere was amazing. very accommodating and informative. great energy. i loved staying at the apartment, it\\'s a quick walk to some great food and bars.ambere was very communicative and flexible about my arrival time.  the room in her apartment is as advertised--one of three off a hallway, with kitchen, toilet room and bath/shower room at the other end of the hall.  i never was bothered by noise in or outside the apartment, and all who were there were friendly guests or dwellers in the other rooms.  plenty of bathroom amenities and places to put things in my room. the apt. is in a great location, down the street from dubose coffee shop and park.  easy to get to my destinations throughout the city.  a very nice stay for my first time as a guest on airbnb.comfortable bed and good location!this was my first time using airbnb and i have to say it was a very good experience. ambere gave very clear instructions on how to get there and stayed in touch up until my arrival. she also gave me advice on the best way to get there from the airport. the location was great, very close to a metro station and lots of tram/bus stops. the room and the flat were exactly as described. everything was spotlessly clean, the bed was very comfortable, the shower was hot and powerful. couldn\\'t really ask for more! i was in sf for work so was not in the apartment very much but when i did get a chance to do some sightseeing ambere gave me lots of tips for the best places to go with the time i had. definitely a bonus staying with a local with great local knowledge. the other great reviews don\\'t lie, i would recommend staying here.\\r\\nambere is a terrific host, very helpful.  the room was fine, just as advertised, in one of sf\\'s delightful neighborhoods, close to transportation, entertainment, food and shopping.  everything was clean and well maintained.  we\\'d definitely sty again.best location in the city. clean, quiet, safe, very comfortable. ambere was great - really friendly and welcoming, very accessible if we needed anything and gave very useful advice for navigating the city.the home was in a very convenient location for the castro clubs and bars. there was also easy access to groceries and restaurants. the host was very easy to communicate with and went out of her way to make sure we were able to get parking passes for our car. she also was helpful through the week by answering questions we had.  the only negative i\\'d list here is that we didn\\'t realize there would be others sharing the common bathroom besides ourselves and the host. there were at least 5-6 people for one bathroom because of other roommates in the flat.  maybes that something i should have asked ahead of time but it made it tricky getting ready in the mornings and going out at night.  i\\'d recommend this home if you are looking for an affordable, convenient, no frills stay in the castro. ambere\\'s apartment was perfectly located. we really enjoyed easily being able to get to and from all the locations in san francisco that we wanted. the room itself was very comfortable. the only complaint would have to be the the thin doors which sometimes let sound in when people were starting their day early in the morning. ambere\\'s apartment was in a great location, and otherwise exactly as described! the room itself was tidy and clean and had everything we needed. \\n\\nambere and her other (sensitive contents hidden) were kind & accommodating - i highly recommend this space! apartment is in a great location near several good neighborhoods. the room was as shown and the price was very fair - ambere was very friendly. i worked a lot so not much interaction - but a good experience all around!great neighborhood, great location and wonderful hospitality.  amber and co. made me feel so incredibly welcome.  transitions to a new city are never easy and amber made me feel welcome.  would certainly recommend.  ambere was a very nice host. she showed us around the apartment on arrival and was able to make checking in easy. the neighbourhood was lovely and right near some great places to eat and drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nan issue with the room is that the walls are very thin, resulting in a lot of sound coming in from other rooms [as well as the feeling that you must be very quiet to have a private conversation]. in addition, the chair pictured is no longer in the room, leading to a lack of surfaces to sit on. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe listing also didn\\'t make mention that there is another room in the apartment also rented out through airbnb so there will possibly be other guests staying at the same time as you.we had a wonderful stay! ambere was kind, sweet, helpful with anything we needed! we consider it a pleasure to have stayed and hope to stay there again the future. ambere welcomed me and my boyfriend with a smile even we check in late around 8pm. the room was cute and small, very homey. and the bed was amazing. safeway is about 2 blocks away. since we didn\\'t rent a car, this place is an ideal if you\\'re going to travel via public transportation. i would recommend this spot if you would like to experience san francisco in a more local perspective.i really enjoyed staying at ambere\\'s place. especially location and bed:di did not make it to sf that weekend but she was available and communicative via messagingambere is friendly and helpful. first of all, the location is perfect. the room is a really nice size, beautiful, and very quiet. the bed and linens are also very nice and comfortable. we enjoyed staying here. great location. ambere was super nice and went out of her way to help. there is no living room or dining room in the house but the kitchen is nice and everything is very clean. our room was comfy and pretty. awesome shower. ambere made sure i got in ok and the room was lovely.  she was out of town for the weekend but the friend she had looking after the place was awesome.  location was centrally located between the mission and castro, so there\\'s certainly plenty to do nearby!nice room, great neighbourhood. ambere was not in town, but that was absolutely no issue, she could easily be the most responsive host i ever had.very comfortable stay! the memory foam mattress is a dream. great, centrally located apartment in a nice neighborhood. ambere was friendly and accommodating. highly recommend, would stay again!this was a nice room with a firm queen bed in a quiet neighborhood. it was good to be able to open the windows for some fresh air but still got a bit stuffy because it is an interior view. ambere was very helpful with a wonderful breakfast recommendation.ambere has an exceptionally clean home with wonderful personal touches making the room feel very welcoming.  the neighborhood has a very residential feel, however restaurants, bars, shops, and public transit are only a few blocks away.  \\r\\nclean, quite, and walking distance to attractions.  exactly what i was looking for.  the bedroom was very clean and neat. ambere is super friendly and helpful. my stay was very pleasant. very welcoming, very easy and safe, great apartment and host.  ambere was very kind and had suggestions for everything and was a fantastic host.  ambere was very welcoming and made me feel like i could make myself at home. she checked in regularly to see if i needed anything, and she even braved the city parking agency to get a parking pass for me! also her apartment is very central to everything in sf. only downside is that there is no living room to hang out in, but ambere mentioned she is working on converting one of her rooms to a common area soon!the room is nice and the apartment well located in a quiet place and near by walking of the mission area.\\r\\nand ambere intents to feel you at home.emily is a great host and her place is in a great location. i enjoyed my stay :)the bedroom was very clean and close to metro station. ambere is super friendly and supported us with many tips concerning dining and getting around.\\r\\nwe enjoyed staying here.ambere is such a fun and welcoming host! she made us feel right at home and made sure we were well taken care of. she makes sure you have what you need to be comfortable but also gives you your space to relax. there\\'s a grocery store a couple blocks away and multiple restaurants to try too! her place is about a block from the muni line, which was great for us since we headed into downtown to do some sightseeing. we\\'d definitely stay with ambere again!everything was exactly as described!\\r\\nambere is a an awesome host, \\r\\ni would not only gladly reserve another bnb from her, i would gladly host her as a guest in my own home. the neighborhood is one of the best in sf.\\r\\nambere\\'s home was in a great location and just as described.  she was very hospitable and provided excellent accommodations.i had a wonderful experience at ambere\\'s place! the room is walking distance to nice places to eat, a park where my dog could play and lots of street parking in the area. the room itself was super comfy, she provided towels, lots of pillows and the mattress was one of those memory foam things that make you want to sleep for days. i was exhausted after traveling so i fell  asleep super early around 9 and no one disturbed me, no street noise, no neighbors etc. it was lovely. everything in her place is clean and welcoming, the bathroom and kitchen are nice and she provides shampoo/conditioner/body wash in case you forgot to bring some. ambere herself is very friendly and welcoming, extremely easy to talk with and happy to give you any help you need. it was a lovely experience! ambere was the perfect host. i needed a spot to stash my niece while she was in the city visiting me, and ambere made her feel very welcome. her place is very close to all the fun stuff in the castro / duboce triangle but still in a very pastoral neighborhood. she runs a tight ship. when my mom comes to visit i’ll be calling ambere again.great neighborhood, great place, friendly and welcoming host. i highly recommend!we visited s.f. for the first time in the end of june/start of july 2015, and had a very nice time! our host was extremely helpful, joyful and sweet, and gave us directions to excellent places to eat. \\nthe room was nice, clean and spacious (at least for our taste). \\namber provided very good wifi, housekeeping and very tasteful coffee whenever we wanted.  \\nthe location of the apartment was perfect for us - going to the castro all the time :-)great. nice room and great location.this is a very roomy, eclectic apartment that was just 2 blocks from the moscone center where we were attending a conference.  the bedroom area was very quiet, no street noise at all which it made for great sleeping and a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. the artwork in the apartment isn\\'t for those who are traveling with children or are squeamish about nudity.my stay at errol\\'s apartment was everything i had hoped for. he was beyond accommodating for my friends and i, and we all loved experiencing his house vibe. the decor is unique and exciting and there is plenty of space for multiple people to stay here. my friends and i would love to come back to errol\\'s again. he\\'s a sweetheart too!the decoration was quite adult-themed, so i wouldn\\'t recommend it for families. otherwise quite a cool chillout-place. a few minuses were that not all the beds had sheets and tuning the shower water temperature was difficult.truly amazing apartment if you know what you are getting into.  huge, interestingly decorated, nice stereo and tv etc.   not so much natural light but for me that was a plus; no kitchen either but again if you are aware that\\'s not a big deal.\\r\\nerrol was very friendly and was really easy to coordinate with. his apartment is a fantastic and funky space, too. can\\'t wait to stay there again next time i\\'m in town for a conference at the moscone!errol was a great host and the apartment is beyond spectacular. such a cool collection of interesting artifacts that even tempted us to never leave. highly recomended for anyone wanting to stay at a fun place in the city.the host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.errol was absolutely fantastic and went above and beyond for us during our stay. the place was immaculate. the best part of course was the decor! there was plenty of space here for 3 adults, and the location was very convenient for us at the time (anyone attending events at moscone will appreciate this location). i\\'d highly recommend staying here, and we will definitely try in the future!errol was a great host. there were plenty of things to make an out-of-towner feel at home. he was very helpful and friendly and his place is one of a kind.this place is the best! super clean, best vibes, obviously very interesting decor. it was impossible to feel bored here. nice and big, plenty of towels, blankets, and bottled water! errol was an excellent host and super accommodating with our schedules. highly recommend this place! can\\'t wait to stay here againthis was such a great place, it was hard to leave and explore the city! great host, very thoughtful touches! this place is like a art installment! we were a group of 5 girls and there was plenty of space for us all. clean, comfy, would defiantly stay here again! energy here was so positive! can\\'t say enough good things about this place! hardest thing about it was resisting the urge to barrow a neckless off one of the cool decorations. stay there you\\'ll see what i mean!   errol was a great host and this was an amazing place. the decor is unbelievable and the place has such great vibes! great place, great locationcozy and colorful and clean. great spot, i would stay here again.i spent a great week in sf in errol\\'s place. flat decoration is just amazing ... everyday you discover something more.\\r\\n\\r\\nerrol\\'s was a really reactive and flexible host considering our change of plans.great experience in the most original apartment i\\'ve ever been too! errol has also been the perfect host!errol\\'s place is an absolute work of art. it reflects the special culture of san francisco and makes lounging in your own place an experience unto itself. the layout is spacious and each bed is unique. errol has really put a lot of work into this place and it shows. we\\'ll be back for sure!nice and neat place.louis was very welcoming and looks after a fantastically located and well set-up house. you can\\'t get a better location than this in san francisco, and there is a nice community vibe amongst the others who share the space.great location! its a community where we can share experiences and have good moments ... maybe one of the best places to stay in north beach. definitely recommended!!! i lived in sf for a year, but i wish i could have lived at louis\\' place during all that time because living at this place is such a wonderful experience that i didn\\'t want to leave after only staying for just one week. he is a superb host and goes above and beyond to make all guests feel comfortable and at home. there is such a meeting of the minds among the guests that opt to stay here, that the energy of collaborative thinking is (email hidden)e stay here if you have a strong desire to get out of your respective specialized silo or field of know leg and wish to socialize and create real-world innovative applications, approaches and ideas to move humanity forward. enjoy your stay i\\'m confident you will as much as i did. i would recommend this place 100% and i will stay here anytime i\\'m back in san francisco.great location, fun environment.  louis is really nice and very helpful. an unique experience indeed!!what an incredible experience! even though we didn\\'t get to meet keith in person unfortunately, he did everything to make us feel comfortable in his beautiful home. we locked ourselves out (be aware of this when going to the backyard through the garage door) and despite him being at work, he organized a friend to come out and help us immediately. having friends like that is just another proof that he is a very likeable and honorable guy and you will find many more in his sweet house. everything is as in the pics and he makes it easy for you to feel home. thank you for a great end to our trip through california!i don’t live far from san francisco but was in desperate need of a ‘staycation\\' so i booked this exceptional home for the weekend. daniela was warm and responded promptly. when i arrived  my jaw dropped. you pass through a beautiful entryway and  as you walk into the home you get a gorgeous panoramic view of the city. even on a cloudy day it’s amazing. i was greeted with a lovely note and bottle of wine. i have to say this was an incredible treat. the rooftop deck with a sweater, bottle of wine and priceless view is enough to make most people forget the stress in their life. i highly recommend this place and look forward to a return visit. daniela\\'s home is absolutely stunning, with a clean, modern design and amazing view from both floors.  it is beautifully furnished and appointed, and includes a high end sound system for music throughout the home.  there was coffee, full bath linens, and everything else one would need.  the master bathroom was built for an emperor.  one note of little consequence: the master bedroom is on the main (not upper) floor; i had expected the upstairs bedroom with the larger terrace to be the master.  the upstairs bedroom has a beautiful view and adjoins the large roof deck, but has no separate door and you have to go back down to use the bathroom.  all together, we had a perfect stay and look forward to returning another time. the house is lovely and the hosts are wonderful - the guide book was really helpful and the house had everything we needed.   the views are spectacular and golden gate park is a 15 minute walk away.  if you want a really comfortable place to spend some time with easy access to san fransisco\\'s sights and shops, you couldn\\'t do better.absolutely no problems. this place turned a work trip into an experience my contractors will not forget.my work mates and i had a really enjoyable stay at daniela\\'s place. the place and the views are both insane - everything went very smoothly and the place is immaculate. twin peaks is a quiet neighbourhood that is easily accessible to castro, mission and haight. would definitely recommend staying here for future visits in san francisco when i am travelling in a group.daniela was great to interact with, very responsive and prompt to reply to any questions i had. her home was clean and comfortable, the views were spectacular. the location was also very convenient and we didn\\'t have any issues with finding street parking. all in all, we were very happy with our stay. we loved the space and the light, vies and location - in the city but away from the fray.  two bedrooms are private, the third is open and has noise from the kitchen. the house is beautifully decorated, and has a charming and comfortable feel. our only regret is that our stay was so short! we\\'d return in a heartbeatour host was fantastic and the listing is amazing.  the pictures don\\'t do it justice.  very spacious and comfortable.  perfect for a week long stay with colleagues.  one day we were having trouble with the key and someone was immediately sent over to help us out.  great service!the view is excellent! really great place for family or friend.!daniela is a wonderful and thoughtful host with a wonderful property! a beautiful home with a stunning view with a marvelous top deck - a perfect place to relax and soak up the sights. i highly recommend daniela and her property - just be sure to leave some time for me to return and enjoy it again!this condo looks perfect in pictures, and the views are stunning - nothing can take away from that. however, the house was absolute filth upon arrival. at a rate of over $900/night (memorial day), you would expect it to be clean! we booked the house for over 4 nights, and walked into to find hair and filth all over every piece of furniture - it didn\\'t look like it wasn\\'t just cleaned after one visit, it looked like it hadn\\'t been cleaned in weeks and used as a public party house between visits! we spent our first hours in the property trying to make ourselves comfortable - we didn\\'t know what else to do, having already booked and being a family of 6. we arrived after a 6-hour flight to sweep, mop, scrub, vacuum, and minimize as much filth as we could. the management team were quick to respond with a cleaning refund (after all, we did do all the work!), but the stay was pretty much spoiled by the filth and disgusting condition of the property. the sheets had been changed, but that\\'s about all that was fresh. it was so gross. we enjoyed the view but never were comfortable enough to truly relax. our money would\\'ve been much better spent at a 5-star resort. truly disappointing.amazing house, great location, spectacular view!  everything about our stay was fantastic.  couldn\\'t have asked for a better time in the city.  would definitely stay here again!  stunning home with a very warm & cozy feel.ubelievable view , we had an amazing stay in this 5this was our second stay at daniela\\'s home.  another terrific experience.  can\\'t get enough of that beautiful view.amazing home.  the views were just spectacular.  was so convenient to get to everywhere we wanted to be.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe only challenge was uber lol.  they kept going to the clayton st side of the house, not the correct side.  all in all i will be coming back to san fran and this place is on my favs this stay was perfect from top to bottom.  check in to late check out.  we wanted for nothing. the reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.our hosts were absolutely  wonderful. they made us feel very welcomed. the neighborhood is lovely and very quiet despite being in the city of san francisco. the views are stunning no matter if you\\'re on their balcony, or around the property. the room was perfect for what we needed, bed was very cozy, too. it was definitely the perfect place to stay!  it\\'s such a wonderful experience staying with steve and leksi! the view from their rooftop is gorgeous, the couple are so friendly, and the room is comfortable. i would definitely choose them when i come back visiting sf again, if they still have room available:)we spent a longish weekend in the apartment with miles. check-in was without problems. the view from the apartment took our breath away. the apartment is in very lifely area, lots of restaurants, bars, and supermarkets in walking distance, good ground transpotation close by. miles was a gracious host, we could use kitchen, living room and all the building amenities at our will. drinks, beer and wine were flowing freely.\\r\\ni strongly recommend, its not everyday you can wake up and see both the city and the bay at morning !miles apartment is fantastic, the view is absolutely incredible and the descripiton very accurate. miles makes the check in and check out process very easy. his communication is great and he is a great host. it was so nice to have this very spacious and very clean apartment for ourselves. the apartment complex  has a great fitness center and hot tub. the location couldn\\'t be better...walking distance to many coffee places, at&t park, moscone center and much more.  there is even a supermarket right in front of the apartment! so convenient! thanks for a great stay, miles!amazing view! great host. clean and bright apartment. we had a very pleasant stay at mile’s place. definitely a good spot for a business trip!the picture of the place is of a base model, but the actual place is nice too. the view is probably the best view i\\'ve ever seen. it literally takes your breath away. to your right is the water & on the left is the city!!!! and the balcony is great! the place is clean & location is perfect and right near the at&t park! the check in process is easy. parking is a nightmare my advice is to park in one of the overnight structures or better yet don\\'t bring a car!!!!  the place has all of the amenities you will need! beautiful views, super clean and everything you need. the building is beautiful with a great fitness room, wonderful top floor lounge with tv and comfy sofas. miles was flexible and friendly. beds were very comfy and clean.miles\\' apartment was phenomenal!! the whole busy superbowl weekend was made so easy by staying here. check in and check out could not have been smoother. highlights were the stunning view, fireworks from at&t park, and access to the building\\'s awesome gym!! the area was easily accessible but just outside of the chaos and traffic. very nice kitchen with huge island not in the pictures!\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you miles for giving these airbnb newbies a chance! we\\'re hooked!miles\\' place was incredible. we were staying in the bay for a technology conference at pier 48, which was a short walk. incredible views, amazing responsiveness by the host (he was accommodating on check-in time when our flight was delayed and even cut us a second set of keys so our whole group could come and go). due to a couple meetings we had in the valley, we decided to rent a car and it should be noted the neighborhood was a little tricky to park nearby. but there\\'s consistent all-day metered parking around the 400 block of townsend (a five minute walk). would definitely stay here again. miles was very welcoming, being more than accommodating to meet us in the middle of his saturday night :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was clean and tidy and even better than it looked in the picture. the view from the windows / balcony of sf really is mind blowing! it\\'s super spacious and easy to feel like home. there\\'s also a great social space on the roof of the block w a pool table etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a great week there; it was the ideal base to explore the fun parts of the city, whilst being near enough downtown district (we were there for business) to stroll into work each morning.\\r\\n\\r\\ncouldn\\'t recommend it highly enough!we had a nice time at miles\\' apartment. he is a friendly host and also had a welcome gift ready for us. wonderful location and view! the apartment is exactly like in the pictures. one weird thing is that in one of the two rooms the towels were really wet when we (url hidden) guess is that they were washed but not driedmiles was a great host, no issues at all.  nice apartment in a newer building very close to at&t park.  we went to see a giants game and this was an ideal location to get to and from the park easily.  phenomenal place, incredible view, and miles was a friendly, responsive and attentive host. a+!the apartment has an amazing view!  miles is quick to respond, flexible, and understanding.  good quality beds.  i\\'d like to come back.  i\\'m glad to recommend it to you.i was very happy with how smoothly our airbnb stay was especially given the fact that we booked two days prior to arriving! the apartment is large enough that it\\'s easy to have your privacy even if there are other renters staying in the unit. the room was surprisingly more spacious than the pictures portray which was great for two people! carlos was very prompt in his replies whenever we had questions and everything was true to advertisement. fantastic stay in san francisco!  bekah and dayne were very welcoming and very easy to work with on our arrival time as it wasn\\'t set in stone.  the house was just as pictured and was in a great/safe part of town with easy access to just about everything there is to experience in sf.  bekah and dayne went out of their way to accommodate us......even went as far as buying a crib so our toddler felt at home!  wow what a great find! the house was perfect for our girls weekend trip to sf and napa. we were a group of 9 and the house was the perfect size for our large group. \\r\\n\\r\\ndanye and bekah are amazing hosts, they both welcomed us to the house, showed us around and answered all our questions in a quick timely manner. thank you also for the fresh flowers and the breakfast treats.\\r\\nthe beds in all 4 rooms were extremely comfortable, the rooms are large, the living area is bigger then the pictures appear, everything we needed plus some was available in the house. very accurate description of the house. transportation was super close, great quiet neighborhood. i would love to come back and book the same place again. absolutely a positive experience, thanks so much! i do not have enough good things to stay about our stay at bekah and dayne\\'s wonderful san francisco home. both dayne and bekah were extremely welcoming and responsive to every communication prior to arriving. they greeted us upon arrival and made us feel at home. there home is lovely and inviting, and all of the guests who stayed with us during the four days expressed how \"at home\" they felt there.  it is a large, bright, comfortable house with a well stocked kitchen. i was very,very pleased and would stay here again without a moment\\'s hesitation.  i felt most comfortable in bekah and dayne\\'s wonderful home!     by far the best house i have ever been to on airbnb. everything was perfect. hosts were extremely nice. they even bought us breakfast for the next day. i highly recommend this place. it is close to everything. especially if you have a car. amazing place!!bekah and dayne were terrific hosts! this was my first experience with airbnb, and they truly made it a wonderful one. our group absolutely loved the house. we wish we could have stayed there longer! it was the perfect spot for us all to reunite with each other and relax. and it was only a quick trip away from delicious food and gorgeous sights. i would highly recommend staying here. your group is in for a treat if you do. cheers!the house is very clean and located in a great neighborhood. i would definitely stay here again!thank you bekah and dayne for welcoming my family and me into your home. bekah and dayne made our family feel very welcome into their home. prior to our arrival and stay, behak inquired if there was anything we needed that she can help provide for us in their home. \\r\\nbekah and dayne\\'s home is very clean, cozy, and in a quiet neighborhood. the home was close to the muni transportation, places to eat, and convenience stores (all in walking distance). bekah and dayne reminded us that they are just a call away if we needed anything. our party of eight truly enjoyed our visit to san francisco and the home we were able to stay in. lots of great amenities. bekah and dayne are great host, prepared with everything one may need while staying in their home. thank you. we had a great weekend stay in this beautiful, charming home. bekah and dayne were incredibly kind and easy to communicate with. the house is very spacious with four bedrooms, a large living room, dining room, kitchen, and outdoor patio. every room had fresh flowers and new linens. we wished we could have stayed longer!we had a lovely stay at bekah and dayne\\'s. the house is delightful, has everything you might want in it, and is in an ideal location for exploring the city. public transport is right on the corner and it is an easy trip into downtown. we particularly loved the patio space which is beautiful in the evening. the bedrooms are incredibly comfortable and are filled with natural light (which is lovely  but you might want to bring eye masks if you are a light sleeper). the local coffee shop, antigua, is great too and although we didn\\'t get to try any of the nearby restaurants, they had good yelp reviews. \\n\\nbekah and dayne were ideal hosts, were great with speedy communication prior to our arrival, and gave us a warm in-person welcome when we got there. if we are coming back to the city with friends or family again, this will be our first choice for a place to stay. the host canceled this reservation 349 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.dayne and bekah are great hosts and their house is simply a fabulous place to have a family/friend vacation. before arriving they were communicative about the arrival plan and made me feel good about reaching out with any requests. upon arrival, they met us at the house and gave us a tour, answering all of our questions. we did not see them again, but still they were contactable by phone and always felt accessible. the house was the perfect space for my dad and mom, my two sisters and their families and my husband and me. though the house is in the sunset - which always seemed so far away from everything when i lived in the city - it is super easy to get from here to there. taraval (the cross street) has a muni line and via car you can go up and over the city (vs through the heart) around twin peaks in no time. from the house\\'s garage (that\\'s right a reserved private parking space) to soma took 21 minutes (not bad at all). plus, it was nice to come \"home\" to a neighborhood that was quiet and safe. those of us who wanted a to grab a drink at the local watering hole went down around the corner to grandma\\'s, which was the perfect neighborhood dive bar. between the great house, beautifully remodeled and stylishly designed, and excellent hospitality, i honestly cannot say enough good things about our weekend together at dayne and bekah\\'s. just that i wish all my airbnb experiences were this phenomenal!bekah and dayne\\'s place in san francisco was amazing the home was beautiful clean and very inviting. we had a great time staying at their place, dayne was a great host, he welcomed us as soon as we got to the house and he gave us a tour of the house.  there\\'s this awesome book that they have in the house that contains helpful information to go see and places to eat and even transportation around san francisco. our visit san francisco was even better because we stayed at bekah and dayne\\'s house. i definitely recommend staying here especially for a big group of people. we will definitely stay here again when we come back to the area. thanks again.what a wonderful experience our entire family had in bekah and daynes bright warm and welcoming space! i didn\\'t meet them but my in laws raved about how sweet and what a great couple they were!!!! everything was as described - beds were comfy and there was enough space for \" time alone\"\\n   the kitchen was perfect and we were able to make coffee and eggs..\\n  bekah was so easy to communicate with before the trip and even left a welcome basket!!!!\\n   great way to celebrate sons graduation from sfsu!!!!the host made us feel welcome immediately.  there were brief introductions and then we were left to enjoy their home.  there was enough room for all of us.  house is located by the zoo and a quick bus ride to golden gate bridge.  the parking was ample.  there was only one issue with a few of the rooms not being as clean as expected.  there was a moldy smell on the sheets in 1 room and after a personal scrub and wash there was excessive dust/dog hair.  the mattress had a brown stain that was found during sheet change.  also milk in fridge with 2013 expiration date...not sure why that was still there.  one of the extra comforters in the closet was torn.  so we were out of 1 bedroom because our guest didn\\'t want to sleep in there after seeing this.  area rugs could use a good wash or update as they were a bit dirty.  were not total clean freaks but didn\\'t like noticing these little quirks.  minus these issues the stay was good and we couldn\\'t beat the location/size.    this was house a great find!! the hosts were so helpful and friendly. it was very easy to communicate with them before and during our stay. the house itself was neat and clean when we arrived. they even had basic food staples ready for us! the rooms were perfect for our 2 families and comfortably fit all 9 of us. the location was convenient: close to public transportation, grocery store, walgreens and many great restaurants! we highly recommend this house!!!beautiful apartment!  bekah and dayne left a binder filled with suggestions and a bottle of champagne and coffee for us too, which was super thoughtful.  we had an amazing time. very comfy and cozy experience when we were at the house. grocery store was convenient. they were great hosts. their book was especially helpful and  always very responsive to questions or concerns. loved the extra keys available for us and all the small unexpected things. this was my first air bnb experience, and it was more than wonderful. dayne gave us a tour when we first got there, left us some nice groceries, left us multiple keys, etc. this house was perfect for the group i was with. there were 4 large bedrooms, a nice sized living room and kitchen, and garage space. the location is also perfect and walking distance to a grocery store, restaurants, parks, and so much more. thanks for everything!this was our first airbnb experience and we really enjoyed it. as a large multi-generational group taking a post wedding trip we didn\\'t all arrive at the same day/time so didn\\'t personally meet dayne but my brother who was over from england and my daughter did. both were impressed with dayne\\'s friendliness and encouragement to make themselves at home and use their wifi coffee etc. the bottle of sparkles and the folder of information was a nice touch. the location in the \\'burbs was fantastic for the muni system and one day we got the tram all the way back from at&t ball park without needing to change. also there were lots of local restaurants which we sampled including the those recommended by the hosts. as part of a large group is was also nice to occasionally sneak off to the tranquility of the roof garden.\\r\\nwe all really enjoyed our stay here !!!our host greeted us after a 3 hour wait while we were going to the wrong address.  he had a basket of amenities waiting for us, gave us a personal tour of the house, explained where everything was kept and made sure there were eggs and milk in the house.  the home was everything we expected and more.  beautifully kept and decorated, fully stocked with everything you might need to make the place a home.  the house was very convenient to public transportation, it was very easy to navigate around the city and the people we met on the street were all friendly and welcoming.    i recommend the house of bekah & dayne if your are looking for a great place in san francisco !! the house is very great ! we felt like home ! we really appreciated the bottle of champagne, the basket of goodies and informations about the neighborhood !\\r\\nwe all really enjoyed our stay here !dayne gave us a very warm welcome, which included a bottle of champagne and a basket of goodies, he took his time to explain everything about the house in detail, the restaurants in the neighborhood, transportation and things to do around his lovely home.  the neighborhood is fantastic, close to beach, the golden gate park and amazing restaurants. the location is ideal. the house is beautifully decorated, very bright, bedrooms very roomy, the kitchen is fully equipped, they even left us food we could use. the house is impeccable. the beds are very comfortable. the kids had a great time in the porch and back yard.  garage was a big plus.  one place you must visit during your stay is the marco polo italian ice cream place on taraval, the ice cream is the best i have ever had.  don\\'t miss it!!this was a great experience, both as a first time airbnb user and as a guest of bekah and dayne\\'s. great place perfectly located in sf. great rooms with excellent views. our group felt right at home and highly recommend staying here. great place and hosts. great space. easy communications. garage access was really nice. very airy rooms. we didn\\'t use the roku or tv much but nice to have around. location is a bit far from center of sf but really nice places on taraval a block away. sunset living at its finest. it\\'s our first time to travel to usa. dayne and bekah has been  a good hosts. their home is very well accessible to a muni leading us to all sites of san francisco. we were even welcomed with complimentary wine and freebies. the place is secured which is the most important thing. since we are asians, we never missed home since there are asian restaurants and groceries along taraval. the house is big enough to shelter 12 pax.\\nthe neighbors are charming and lovely as well.bekah and dayne were extremely welcoming. i was in town with colleagues, and i was not able to participate in dayne\\'s initial welcome and walk-through, but i understand that he was extremely thorough and kind. there was also a binder full of helpful information. the house itself was comfortable and clean. the location was further from downtown then i had anticipated, but the l line was convenient, and it was easy to come and go by uber as well. a great place to stay - it would be lovely to be there in better weather and with more time to take advantage of the lovely deck area.  dayne was such a great host! he showed us every nook and cranny and made us feel very welcomed. they left a gift basket with champagne and coffee that was such a great touch! the house was very clean and spacious. we felt like locals during our stay! it reminded me of an anthropologie catalog and was really well kept. bekah and dayne were the best hosts any first time airbnb user could ask for! they are prompt in their response to any question you may have. they are accommodating, thoughtful, and all around amazing people! \\n\\nmy family and i came up from los angeles for a wedding we attended in berkeley. it was a perfect place for a family get together with ages ranging from 5- mid 50\\'s. they were flexible with our check in and check out time and we immediately felt like we were home as we walked into their wonderfully decorated place! we were greeted by a very thoughtful welcome basket filled with champagne, strawberry rhubarb jam, coffee, a fully stocked refrigerator and an amazing detailed guide of places to go and what to see. the pictures do not do this place justice! the home has some much character. the group all agreed that whenever we visit the bay area that we will stay at bekah and dayne\\'s! we arrived at the house late at about 8pm and unfortunately did not manage to meet dayne and bekah.\\r\\nwe went into the clean house with a basket of goodies included - we are very appreciative of that! the folder on the table also gave us an idea of where to head for for dinner - we chose house of pancake. it was awesome to have a bowl of hot soup when the weather outside was cool.\\r\\nthe house was huge and big enough for 10 of us (including 2 children) and all of us had one of the best sleep for the 4 nights that we were there. the location was great, near to many eateries and also a safeway nearby - dayne was very helpful in recommending some discounts to us as well and communication before and during the trip was smooth. we enjoyed the place very much and hope to stay here again the next time we come to sf!we loved the spacious and luminous bedrooms. we liked the dining room decor and enjoyed the living-room with its big screen. the kitchen is well-equipped and spacious enough to cook light meals. it is great to have washer and dryer available. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe garden brings meditation time and playroom for kids.the availability of the garage makes parking easier for out-of-town drivers. the house book is useful; it allows guests to function easily throughout the house and to be able to cope should a malfunction occur in the house. the literature about sf and surroundings sites and events invites guests to discover more about the region when time does not allow them to see all.\\r\\n\\r\\nbathrooms, although justifying the character of the house, are a little small and of need of plumbing upgrades, particularly in the downstairs one. the shower stall is quite small there and a shower handle comes off sending the user to jump out as water temperature setting is off. on the other hand, the mountain of available towels and toilet paper is a great touch.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, we enjoyed our stay and we thank you for opening your house and garden. we left with nice memories of our stay to share with friends and family…. all the way to france!\\r\\ndayne greeted us and gave us a tour even though we were a few hours later then expected.  he had a cute welcome basket with coffee, champagne and jelly.  he had bread, milk and butter available.  this house was stocked with plenty enough towels, sheets, pillows, blankets, soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc. there was a washer and dryer available with detergent and a huge barbecue pit in the back yard which we ended up using.  the hot water heater leaked (which had nothing to do with getting hot water) and dayne had a plumber come out within a couple of hours even though he already had it checked out the day before.denise is a fabulous host.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe space is a cozy extra bedroom in a modern mid-rise in soma. there\\'s a super chill bar beneath the complex called \"city beer store\", and it became a go-to place to kick-off the evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe area seemed safe and i routinely walked home alone in the evening and early morning. there\\'s an excellent breakfast place called soma cafe just a couple of blocks east; i highly recommend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bed was a twin and the linens and pillow covers were freshly cleaned. take note that folsom can be a noisy road and the guest bedroom faces the street. i had a little trouble adjusting to the city noise on the first night, but quickly adjusted for the second.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was in town for a conference in the marriott marquis @ 4th & mission. this was an easy ~10-15 minute walk without rushing. for the price and location, you\\'d be hard pressed to find a more welcoming host and comforting space.\\r\\n\\r\\ndenise gave me full autonomy during the stay and provided a key and door code so i could leave and return at my leisure. she provided an iron and ironing board when i needed to press some shirts, a very nice bath robe to wear out of the shower, and furnished the guest room with a tv and apple tv.\\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend you stay with denise. she is a fabulous host and will be sure to make your trip a comfortable one.jeffrey was great. met us right away with the key even though we booked an hour in advance. great place toodenise was a great hostess, providing clean towels and fresh linens every day.  the room was bright and sunny in an up and coming neighborhood.  the location is easily walkable from moscone and the tech companies nearby as well as to the bart and muni at civic center.  \\r\\n\\r\\nas mentioned in other reviews, the place is on a busy street with bars and restaurants and as such can be noisy at night.  this didn\\'t bother me but if you\\'re a particularly light sleeper it\\'s something to keep in mind.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely recommend this location for people visiting from out of town who want to dropped into the middle of san francisco.denise was such an amazing host.  she made me feel so comfortable during my stay.  her knowledge of the area and her passion to provide a great space made me feel right at home.  i was welcomed every evening with a warm smile.  my stay in sf was elevated because of her kindness.denise was a very lovely and gracious host.  she made efforts to make sure i was comfortable, and was a pleasure to interact with.\\r\\n\\r\\npros: denise herself is a lovely person and so that was great.  she keeps the apartment extremely clean, and it looks great.\\r\\n\\r\\ncons: there is not much privacy because the offered bedroom is not separated by a real wall.  and the bed is a twin air mattress.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this was not for me because i like more privacy.  but if you just want somewhere to sleep and a twin bed is enough, then this would be a great place, because denise is such a nice person and keeps the place very clean.my experience at denise\\'s place was fantastic! denise is the perfect airbnb host: nice, friendly, concerned about your well being and not invasive. we had great conversations about her life and san francisco! i also loved the place. the room and the apartment were both very clean and organized. the listing is very well located in soma, near to restaurants, bars, café and public transportation. this is the perfect place to stay! i can\\'t wait to come back and spend more time at denise\\'s place :) denise is a gracious and helpful host. the location is central to all the key areas of the city. easy walk to bart can get you anywhere quickly and easily. folsom street itself is a wonderful location for dining and entertainment. ill be back!denise is s wonderful host very attentive. she was very accommodating had fresh fruit available clean towels every day. was a pleasant stay.denise was a wonderful host. i did not feel like i was far away from home during the stay. the location is very close to the tech offices and it is a lively area with clubs nearby.it was wonderfuldenise made me feel at home from get go. she is very friendly and gave me great tips on how to go around the city and made my experience in sf great. the location is great, it is on walking distance from all the places i needed to go in the city. if/when going back to sf, i would definitely try to stay with her.denise is a lovely and helpful host. the room is cold and there is a lot of noise from the street and nearby clubs. i stayed here for 2 weeks. had a very nice experience. denise is very helpful. all of my used clothes of previous day were washed, dried and ready by the time i came back from office. i would love to stay here again if i come back.had a fantastic time. denise was very hospitable, neat, and clean hostess. i came and went as i pleased and didn\\'t feel like i had to report in. she gave great directions and added ideas that made my stay even more enjoyable!  the bridge to sausalito was awesome!this is a beautiful, clean apartment with amazing views!  melissa was very warm and welcoming.  perfect for the last minute getaway!this was one of my favorite airbnb stays ever. i showed up not feeling very well, just wanting to lie down, and melissa arrived with a whole medicine cabinet of drugs for me to try and help. she was responsive and friendly. also, the location is ideal (+idealic) for anyone who is visiting the city. really, really wonderful. melissa and carlos have a beautiful home perfectly located in san francisco and they were awesome! we stayed there for 5 days and had a great time. the apartment has the most fantastic view over the financial district and a cozy deck. loved the decor in the apartment. we felt instantly welcome.  \\r\\nwhen we arrived there was cold beer and other soft drinks in the fridge :) so nice!\\r\\nwe would definitely use airbnb again and highly recommend melissa and carlos\\' apartment.melissa is a really nice host. the apt is clean, bright beautiful with breathtaking view of the city and the bridge! i couldn\\'t take my eyes off the view through the window. having coffee at the dining table with the morning or at night scenery is such great experience! my friends and i all enjoyed our stay there a lot! thank you melissa!this is a beautiful apartment with an amazing view of the bridge!! it was very clean, very well equipped & tastefully decorated. we were really enjoyed our visit to san francisco, my kids & all were so comfortable. and melissa was a great host!! she even helped us for the great restaurants in town :) thanks for the wine & milk :) thank you so much melissa!! parfait! l\\'appart est super-clean, sa situation géographique permet de visiter une partie de la ville à pied, mais aussi d\\'attraper un cablecar ou l\\'autobus... je retournerai chez melissa lors d\\'une autre visite à sf.\\r\\n\\r\\njust perfect! we arrived late at night and melissa filled the fridge for breakfast. we didn\\'t even ask. she\\'s taking care of everything. location is perfect for walking and discover different part of sf. you can alson easily reach cable car or busses. i could take for hours about the place and you\\'ll hear nothing bad about it. don\\'t wait: rent it!!melissa was very helpful in the emails and replied immediately to all questions. check in was easy, her partner carlos was waiting for us in the apartment. we got 2 sets of keys and great advice about good restaurants and places to visit around. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is fantastic - there is lot of bars and restaurants, fisherman\\'s wharf is within walking distance. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment itself is great, very clean nicely furnished. the laundry machine was useful as well and because of hulu we got hooked on new tv show. \\r\\n\\r\\nmost recommend! melissa and carlos\\' place is absolutely amazing.  the views are incredible and the location is as good as it gets in san francisco.  all the awesome bars and restaurants of north beach are a quick walk away.  melissa and carlos themselves were great to deal with to ensure my friends and i had a good time at their place, which i appreciated.  i would recommend their place to anyone visiting san franciscoan amazing place to stay... very comfortable and melissa was so accommodating and gracious.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe views were spectacular and the location could not be better. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks melissa,\\r\\n\\r\\nanne-marie and edmelissa\\'s apartment is very tastefully decorated and in a great location!  the view from the bay windows were beautiful.  our group felt very at home in the apartment and loved having a spacious area to relax.  melissa was a great host - she had wine and champagne waiting for us and was available throughout the weekend to answer our questions.  i would definitely recommend this unit and will likely rent again in the future!loved the place!  all of the pictures on here are exactly as they appear - even down to the bottle of wine graciously left by melissa and carlos on the table overlooking sf.  as others have said - the apt is on top of a hill, so have cab numbers (or uber - a lifesaver in sf) ready!  but, most of sf is similar and the hill gives the apt a great view of the city that would be hard to replicate elsewhere.  they were also very accommodating with check in and check out times, making our stay that much easier.  i\\'d love to stay again on my next trip out.  thanks again, melissa and carlos!we only had 2 nights in san francisco and melissa\\'s place was perfect for the amount of time we had. we would love to come back and explore more. communication was prompt and everything was as described.the apartment is beautifully appointed. the location is great for getting to local cafes and sites. it is on a steep hill and there are stairs, so may not suit everyone but we just saw this as an opportunity to work out our leg muscles. overall - a wonderful experience.we enjoyed our stay at melissa\\'s a lot! the apartment is big and airy with wonderful views. the sunrise is spectacular from the window in the mornings with an added bonus of wild parrots flying around! the space was clean and inviting and melissa was always available to answer any questions or concerns we had! thanks for a great stay!we were in town with a bunch of family for the niners/rams game and melissa\\'s place was perfect! carlos went above and beyond delivering extra linens, giving restaurant recommendations, and checking on our well being. ideal location, garaged parking (tight but what a perk!), private deck, fantastic city lights and bay view, beautiful decor, kid friendly. first time using airbnb - next time will be hard to beat!! what a lovely space with stunning views, just as described! :)  communication was quick and easy via text and email with melissa. i loved being able to park the car and forget about it!  and melissa was an extremely thoughtful host - even going the extra mile to stock our kitchen with goodies for our arrival.  thanks for a delightful stay!\\r\\n\\r\\n we loved everything about this amazing sf apartment!  it was the perfect size for four of us, the furnishings and amenities were excellent,  and the location was fabulous. we couldn\\'t get enough of the daytime and nighttime views of the city. the hosts\\' communication was thorough and timely and they were attentive throughout our stay. we will definitely return to sf and seek out these hosts again. overall a fantastic and unforgettable vacation experience!a wonderful apartment from which to explore the delights of san francisco. melissa was helpful and prompt at all times and the apartment is fabulous. great views, comfortable beds (we could lie in bed and watch the humming bird and parrots on the deck) well equipped for a longer stay (we stayed two weeks) and we cooked in and had all we needed. we highly recommend this as a base. north beach is great fun with many bars, restaurants and interesting characters and the embarcadero is also close. yes, the hill up from both is steep, but good exercise. this would not suit if you have mobility problems. we highly recommend this great apartment.  thank you melissa……..a fab holiday! jacqui and keiththe apartment was well equipped and in very good condition. melissa is a good host and communication went easily. \\r\\nviews from the apartment is pleasing and everything is within walking distance. i was attending a conference in the moscone center and can definetely recommend the place.melissa is a very thoughtful host, and her communication is excellent.  the apartment is a beautiful place, the views are just wonderful.  it was a very rainy weekend in the city, so having a beautiful place to stay after dinner was great.\\r\\nwhat a great north beach apartment!  nice two bedroom.  well located.  great surrounding restaurants.  amazing views.  i\\'m glad we stayed and would highly recommend to any airbnb friends.the reservation was canceled 17 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the place was quiet, comfortable, and well appointed.  the neighborhood is great; good food, nice bars, and lots of exercise(it\\'s quite hilly). my wife and i, together with our 11-month-old daughter stayed at melissa’s north beach flat for 10 days and have thoroughly enjoyed our time there. although located within the bustling north beach (which is a really nice spot to stay in if you enjoy big city night life), the property is nicely “hidden away” in a residential area a couple of blocks from broadway. it is ideal for families with young children looking for a relatively quiet and peaceful location, yet staying in close proximity to the tourist spots and transport hubs. thanks to the secured garage of this property, we have been travelling a lot in our rental car, making day trips to napa, sausalito, muir woods, etc. have been fun and easy. for those enjoy walking or a bit of jog this is equally a nice location with the steep elevation of the streets leading up to the house. the high up position provides magnificent view of the bay area skyline, bay bridge and the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa has been a very helpful host. knowing we were travelling with our little one she provided high chair and travel cot in the flat. the flat is good size and maintained to a high spec. \\r\\n\\r\\ni’ll have no hesitation recommending this property to anyone visiting san francisco. just make sure you check with melissa if you plan to drive during your stay, the garage will take a mid-size suv with a bit of turning and practice but some guidance from melissa over car type will be helpful.\\r\\nthis apartment is simply awesome!  it is spacious, very clean, has beautiful furniture and of course views!!!! killer views!!!!!!!!  you don\\'t need a car in this neighborhood, you can easily walk to everywhere!\\r\\n\\r\\ni want to say huge thank you to melissa.  she\\'s a wonderful person and the best host you can find!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will definitely stay in this apartment again!the best! our family stayed at melissa\\'s apt. and enjoyed it thoroughly! absolutely everything you need. i think the nicest thing about the apt, beside the spectacular view, is how much care as gone into the apt. the furniture is comfortable, the beds are comfortable, the kitchen is fully stocked for cooking, coffee maker, new everything. the towels are big and fluffy and the art on the walls is lovely and stacks of the best books for reading. oh and a huge tv w great options for viewing. clearly melissa has taken great care to create a space that is comfortable and pleasant for guests. our hosts were quick to reply when we had questions. also, if you little ones - i noticed that there was a bouncy chair, crib etc. and a washer dryer! just note, with the amazing view comes a bit of a hike up the hill and stairs - but it works out well after consuming large quantities of pasta and pastries in north beach. try stella\\'s on broadway for pastries and we had an amazing italian seafood meal at totto mare - just down the hill from the apt! oh and there is a space for parking!!\\r\\ni can not wait to stay there again for our next family meet up in s.f. thank you so much melissa and carlos!melissa was a great host and was nice enough to let my husband and i stay at her place last minute. her home was very clean and in a great area with tons of nightlife, cafes, and restaurants. we appreciated the little extras such as the lyft promo code for $25 and the apple tv and netflix. i would love to stay at melissa\\'s again the next time i\\'m in town.melissa was a fantastic host. she responded to my initial message within 5 minutes, literally, and throughout my interaction with her through airbnb has been very prompt, friendly, and helpful. her property on green street is beautiful, spacious, and inviting, and has breathtaking views of many cool sights in sf. when me and my friends arrived, she was not in town, but she left very precise and detailed instructions in the handbook/house manual that answered all my questions (and then some). she also provides a wealth of information on the surrounding area, where to go for fun/food/drinks, and options on how to get around the city. my friends and i had a lovely weekend at the place, and were all agreed that we would come back given the chance. melissa was an excellent host and i hope that all of my interactions with folks on airbnb will be as pleasant as they were with her. would rent from again, a+. the apartment is beautiful. it is very clean, spacious, accommodating and charming. it has wonderful light in almost every room and overall just has a really comfortable, peaceful, easy vibe about it. it\\'s like putting a cool house on the spot at the park or beach where you like to just sit and relax. we spent a good amount of time just enjoying the comfort of the place and staring out the windows at the beautiful views. \\r\\nmelissa and carlos were always easy to reach, and very nice to do business with.\\r\\nwe missed it as soon as we locked the door to leave.the stay at telegraph hill was amazing and i would very much recommend this place to stay if you are travelling to san francisco. it was in a great location, a very easy walk to the city and to fisherman\\'s wharf. stunning views of the city and the bay bridge. very clean and lovely furnishing. has a laundry and large kitchen to use. melissa was very accommodating and easy to contact. she went out of her way to help with the booking and the stay.

in the apartment, favorable location, nice host, easy communication!absolutely perfect experience! super easy & hassle free from the outset. picked up keys from lockbox, had extra set inside, bottle

gorgeous.  would most definitely recommend!what a beautiful home in the perfect san francisco setting. my partner and i enjoyed the home tremendously and melissa and carlos were always on call to help

we will stay only in this apartment. best recommendations for your stay in san francisco.melissa\\'s house was great! awesome location with an incredibly view of the bay bridge and downtown. will definitely stay there again!this apartment is excellent! the neighborhood is great--the initial shock of being at the tippy top of a hill quickly faded once we got to see the views. melissa was a great host--checking in and leaving everything organized for the arrival and departure process. would stay here again in a heartbeat! melissa was available throughout to provide help and assistance but in reality we did not really need any. the access to the apartment was easy (well documented in the \"house manual\" sent in advance), and also to the garage where we were able to leave our car throughout our stay. the apartment itself was wonderful - exactly as listed - and the views were stupendous.  we took advantage of just about every device in the place - after a 10 day road trip the washing machine and clothes dryer were particularly appreciated.  the deck was an added bonus which we especially enjoyed at breakfast time.  melissa had kindly left a bottle of bubbly in the fridge which we enjoyed.  we found every type of shop and restaurant we needed nearby.  we did one main shop at trader joe\\'s, but other than that used fog hill market (one block down) for our daily needs.  coit tower is nearby and we enjoyed reaching there via filbert steps before enjoying great views.  we ate out a lot around washington square where there are some great eateries - park tavern (pork chops to die for), tonys pizza napoletana (ideal for eating in or take aways) - and drank a few times at vesuvio cafe (historic bar next to the city lights bookstore).  really enjoyed staying in melissa\\'s apartment. location was perfect and really easy to walk to the main areas like union square and fisherman\\'s wharf. the apartment itself is beautiful and clean. . well equipped with all you might need and a fabulous view :) would definitely stay here again when returning to san franthe host is super nice and friendly. she is very reachable and friendly who response my email within minutes. i left my stuff and she informed me and accommodate me to pick it up. the view from the window is awesome too!melissa is amazing, she went above and beyond the call of duty and ensured our stay was top notch! the condo itself is beautiful and had everything we needed and more. we literally walked the whole city, from fisherman\\'s wharf to at & t park, this place is in the heart of the city. the bottle of wine was a nice added touch as well.melissa was very helpful, has a beautiful apartment in a great location in north beach, and i would absolutely stay here again!we had a great experience here.  it is really in a great location to walk to many parts of the city that we were interested in seeing (fisherman\\'s wharf, the piers, north beach area, chinatown, etc).  melissa was super helpful, answering all our questions via email, phone, and text about the apartment and the city.  she also left us a bottle of wine to enjoy with the great views of the city.  overall an excellent experience!awesome location and views! the condo was clean & spacious & kid friendly.everythg was great.  apartment just as described.  thx for helping us make our trip a success!although we never got to meet melissa personally she left us in good hands with carlos. the apartment was wonderful, very comfortable and welcoming. only issue we had was one evening when we had trouble getting the front door unlocked. thought we\\'d have to wait for carlos to arrive but after multiple times trying we finally got in. we were advised to keep it unlocked the rest of our trip but felt comfortable that our stuff was safe due to the locked gate at the street. great location. very close to everything. yes, it is a steep hill but you burned off all the food and drinks each day! highly recommend melissa\\'s apartment.\\r\\nmary & pat \\r\\nclarkston, mihost were very professional and helpfula fabulous flat in a great location - near the top of the hills near coit tower - lots of restaurants and shops nearby and good transport links but also easy walking (if uphill) from market street. wonderful views over the city, downhill stroll to ferry building.\\r\\n\\r\\nsleeps four with ease and two more on the sofa - kitchen well stocked with equipment and some provisions kindly left by melissa and carlos for our arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nwould definitely recommend this flat to anyone who wants to enjoy living in this remarkable city.\\r\\n\\r\\nreally enjoyed our stay at melissa\\'s apartment!  the view and location were unbeatable.  melissa was super accommodating when we were looking for a place to stay on short notice, and communication and check-in were a breeze.this apartment is really nice and centrally located place to stay: one of the highest points in town. it has a beautiful view of downtown sf and the bay bridge. the house offers al the convenience you wish for and the neighborhood is safe and great with various shops and restaurants nearby. in short: we had a very pleasant stay!melissa had a great apartment, the place is nice and tidy with spectacular view! she has been super responsive when we needed anything. plus the location is so great! best stay ever!we had a lovely few days in melissa\\'s apartment with our children aged 12 and 15 years old. melissa was extremely helpful to deal with from the moment we booked. although we never met her she was always on hand to deal with any issues and did so extremely promptly. there was a bottle of chilled bubbly waiting for us when we arrived. the apartment, including the view, was exactly as shown in the photos and the location near restaurants and cafés in north beach was excellent. the climb up the hill was extremely steep but we got used to it and it was worth it for the view! everything was spotless when we arrived with plentiful supplies of clean sheets and towels. nick, the housekeeper, was extremely welcoming and helped us park in the garage. our car was a large sedan (hyundai sonata). it was a tight squeeze but it just fitted and was great to have parking in sf. overall this was a great, centrally located, place to stay.\\r\\ngreat location and superbly appointed apartment. everywhere walkable but somewhere to leave the car too if you\\'re on a ca road trip vacation.  amenable and helpful hosts, this really is what airbnb is about. perhaps an on-hand idiots guide to detailed operation of appliances/tv etc for those of us from foreign shores might be a useful short-cut but otherwise nothing we could suggest to improve on a great experience, worth repeating.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"perfect!\" is the only suitable word to describe our stay at melissa\\'s place.\\r\\ndetailed instructions helped us find the place quickly and check-in smoothly. \\r\\nmelissa is a great host providing her guests a great balance of privacy and being taken care of.\\r\\nthe apartment is just what it shows on the pics. modern, light, with great views from the front window and an outside terrace. fully equipped kitchen, washer/dryer, high speed wireless and cable tv etc. will make your stay comfortable no matter how much time you plan to spend there.\\r\\nthe location is superb! close to everything, clean and quiet neighborhood, dozens of cafes and bars in walking distance. \\r\\nparking space is worth separate mentioning for those who travel on a car like we did. parking can be a real issue in cities like san francisco. \\r\\noveral experience: great\\r\\nwould definitely recommend to everyone!amazing, incredible place and great hosts as well. the check in was very easy, and the space totally surpassed our expectations. sweeping views of the bay bridge and downtown and a relaxing back patio, please do yourself a favor and stay here. an amazing appartment in an incredible location. melissa has provided everything for a comfortable stay. we were travelling with a young baby and were so happy with all the thoughtful details and items provided for us. if we come back to sf we would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting.we were welcomed warmly to this beautiful apartment in excellent location. quiet, clean, nicely decorated. slept 5 although the pull out sofa is not very comfortable (never is).i and my two friends want to thank melissa very much for the perfect stay we had in the apartment! it is just lovely! the apartment is located in a perfect neighbourhood duly surrounded by lots of nice cafe\\'s and restaurants. melissa has provided everything to make our stay perfect! on my next san francisco trip i\\'ll definitely book melissa\\'s apartment again, as for me it was just perfect. thank you for everything melissa!my daughter lives in sf so i\\'ve spent a lot of time here.  i can not tell you just how special this place is.  perfect views and an awesome location. you just can\\'t go wrong.  i think the only problem we had was the heat.  sf is not known for extreme heat, but we managed to arrive on a long run of hot days.  was wishing for a breeze!  thank you so very much for allowing us to share this wonderful place!  melissa\\'s apartment was perfect. the location was ideal for covering the city by foot. the place was clean, well thought out and the views are to die for. i look forward to staying again. the apartment was great - it was everything in the pictures and description. the location was great and is walking distance to a ton of restaurants, shops, stores and other activities.  this was a great place to stay and one i would definitely repeat in the future.the place was great! they let me drop my bags off early -- and the view is amazing. would definitely recommend!we loved our stay at melissa\\'s apartment, so spacious and the view is just as good as the photos!beautiful place.  would highly recommend if you need a place in sf.melissa was nice and very quick to respond. the location has a wonderful view, comfortable beds, and the property manager carlos is the man. i loved the convenience of the key being in the lockbox upon arrival and departure, that made staying and leaving very easy for me. would definitely recommend. melissa was a great host and the place is amazing!! it was a perfect place to use as our bridal suite for the weekend :)the apartment was exactly as advertised, very clean, comfortable, well equipped and spacious with great views. the location nearly at the top of telegraph hill is both terrific and challenging. a few more steps up and a walk around the coit tower is as good as urban life and exercise can get in san francisco. the price you pay is that anything you need in terms of food and supplies is down a very steep hill. for the young of body, no problem; but it took a toll on my old knees. uber was a great asset and a car would quickly arrive to take you even a few blocks up or down the hill. the steps up to the apartment are also steep and narrow - i would warn you against trying to carry a large and heavy suitcase if you have any significant physical limitations. the garage (another great feature) which is at street level can store more than just the car. if not driving, it is a helpful place for friends to put their car when visiting. there is a lovely balcony off one the bedrooms where you can enjoy the quiet surrounded by flowers, greenery and occasional hummingbirds. the neighborhood is truly quiet and yet you are so near north beach, chinatown, and the city center. though walking around the neighborhood can be a bit physically challenging, you are rewarded by inspiring views around every corner. i highly recommend melissa\\'s place; but it clearly is not for a person who has difficulty with stairs or balance problems when on a steep incline.   melissa\\'s place on telegraph hill was absolutely gorgeous. the views from the huge bay windows looking out at downtown sf and the bay bridge are some of the most spectacular i have seen from the city. i am a huge fan and will definitely come back!melissa was extremely accommodating and very real time in her communications. directions and instructions were accurate and simple. the property is well maintained and suited our purposes. recommend it for anyone looking for a great experience in an easily accessible area with outrageous city views. the apartment was a real gem!! can highly recommend this beautiful place, as well as melissa as a host!! we had an incredible experience. thank youwe loved it!! the place was perfect for us; clean, quiet and nicely appointed.  the view was outstanding and the heater works great.  and big thanks to our amazing host, melissa.  hoping to return again soon:-)just spent a week at melissa\\'s place on 304 green. was exactly as advertised. clean, convenient, comfortable and quiet. walking distance to chinatown made meals easy. one block up from a local grocery (ahhh the joys of walking up sf streets).  the parking was a bonus and made life easy. would recommend this place to anyone needing a place near coit tower area. this is what an airbnb experience is supposed to be.this apartment was everything it suggested it would be. stunning views, well equipped, and in a fantastic location. this will be the first place we try to book again when next in san fransisco. the stay was amazing. the location was convenient and close to everything. beds were super comfortable. i would absolutely stay there again whn i come back to visit or work in sf.  melissa was a responsive and welcoming host and the apartment was as advertised.  clean, bright, great views and while the parking spot was tight, it was key to have parking in that part of town- so definitely a bonus.   the location was amazing and close to so many great restaurants and sights.  i\\'d stay here again!we did not meet the owners, but melissa was very prompt and courteous via email and text.  written instructions were crisp and helpful.  the apartment was perfectly located for us, light and airy with solid furnishings.   a small but well stocked market was only a block away, and a great coffee shop another two or three blocks.  we had a wonderful couple of days in sf.great apartment location and communication ! melissa graciously allowed me to make a reservation on behalf of my parents, who aren\\'t familiar with airbnb, and they had a great time!melissa is the perfect hostess, very responsive and answered every question within minutes.  apartment was ideally located, perfect for walking everywhere!  we\\'d definitely stay here again.lovely place in beautiful condition. amazing views and a great roof deck.\\nmelissa was very quick to answer queries and even left a bottle of wine out for me when i arrived.everything was as promised. it\\'s a great location, the view of the transamerica building which is an iconic sf landmark is just stunning. their is also a good view of the bay bridge, and at nighttime you can feast your eyes on the bay lights the renowned led art project. it\\'s a short walk down green street to the heart of north beach where so many restaurants and bars await. \\r\\ncoit tower is very close and there is a back way by foot where one can descend towards the ferry building. i really like the telegraph hill neighborhood a lot.\\r\\nthe apartment is nicely furnished and very comfortable. i wish i owned it! i didn\\'t really want to leave at all!\\r\\nthe only thing i can point out here is that the garage is small. my toyota tacoma barely fit inside!\\r\\ni didn\\'t meet the hosts however there was no need, as i said before it was all as promised and as the pictures showed to a tee.melissa\\'s listing is situated in a prime spot- easy to get around to public transportation, close to the excitement of chinatown, north beach, and telegraph hill while remaining quiet and peaceful. communication was lightning quick, and easy. and she was very accommodating with our last minute booking for the four of us for one evening in the city. she even let us know the apartment was available for an extra night, which rarely happens on the weekend in my experience! \\n\\nthe views are beautiful out front, and we so enjoyed the pristine back deck. blooming trees, and jasmine was growing all around during our stay which made ending the evening or starting the morning on the deck so relaxing. loved the perks of a stocked kitchen, big bathroom, television, and of course, garage! having a safe spot to stow the car during the trip really takes the stress off. \\n\\nour host also graciously left a bottle of wine, extra set of keys, some info about the neighborhood etc, and everything spotless. our most \"hotel like\" experience yet with airbnb- just cozier and more relaxing, with all the comforts of home! the house was exactly as pictured and worked out perfectly for our needs. listing was spot on and both melissa and carlos were awesome to work with.  the place was perfect....clean, cozy and roomy.  we had our whole family and were able to use their pack n play and highchair....both excellent.  awesome location!\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks to them both for an awesome stay....we will be back!flat was as advertised.  very roomy, large, great  views and comfy and clean.  very close to all great restaurants.  located at top of hill, so if your walking, have comfortable sneaks and be ready as the hill is steep.  over all, we had an incredible stay and would stay here again without question.our stay here was everything expected from the listing... the place was perfect for our purposes both for a photoshoot and an overnight stay. the communication with melissa was outstanding and she made us feel very welcomed, including a complimentary bottle of wine waiting for us. we found the apartment immaculate, well appointed, light and airy, and the views are wonderful from the bay windows -- it\\'s a great location for enjoying north beach and the telegraph hill area. another big plus for this place is the accompanying parking space in the garage below the apartment. parking in the area is not easy to find and expensive too so that was much appreciated. we would gladly stay here again for a similar visit to sf.nice place.  great location, but be prepared for the uphill!  walls and floors are thin, but melissa asked for a 10 pm quiet time and we had no issue with the downstairs or next door neighbors.  she also provided an air matress for our third teenager. having laundry there is nice if you\\'ll be there more than a few days. the kids enjoyed the wifi and netflix. garage was a challenge to get the minivan in and out, but an amazing plus!melissa\\'s place was one of the best i\\'ve stayed at in san francisco.  it was clean, bright, modern and has fantastic views of the bay bridge and the transamerica building. i walked downtown often - only 15-20 minutes to union square via chinatown. melissa was very helpful and super easy to deal with.  check-in was no problem. i had a rental car so the garage was a real bonus. melissa left us a welcoming bottle of wine.  i will certainly be staying again.  no hesitation whatsoever recommending her place.  tonymelissa was very responsive prior to our stay and provided superb communication for managing the logistics on the day of our arrival.  the apartment was clean and well-maintained with a high attention to detail.  we will definitely be staying here again on our next conference trip to the san francisco area.  thanks melissa!great place - listing was accurate, apartment was clean. nice neighborhood, beautiful view.  parking (beyond the one car that fits in the garage) is a bit hard to find, may require parallel parking on steep hills.great location with incredible views.   nice apartment with two nice size bedrooms.  easy walk to almost anywhere in sf.  i could not see her but it was very convenient when it comes to checking-in; everything was very well explained and prepared that there was a lock that i could get a key from to go into the house.\\r\\nparking spot was included, which was also awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, as for the location, it is located in the center of the downtown sf but on top of hill, which can be somewhat annoying based on how you travel. for my case, i mostly traveled by car and uber so it was fine. but if you want to walk from to the house, it can be like climbing a mountain.for our very first visit to san fran, this location was perfect. the pictures show you exactly what the place looks like and melissa was very welcoming! she made sure we made it to the apartment okay and very accommodating especially since we were a last minute reservation! we were close to everything. we will definitely come back here to melissa\\'s whenever we come back to san fran to visit! thank you again for everything melissa! very accurate instructions and property was immaculate.  location is great, close enough to the action but in a pleasant neighbourhood.  host helped me with some booking problems i had with the app, for which i was grateful.\\r\\njust beautiful! loved the ambiance! melissa was a great host and her home was amazingoutstanding apartment and host.  we stayed 16 days, but we wished we could have stayed longer.  the location is hard to beat, very close to most sf attractions, but in a very quiet neighborhood and street.  north beach and chinatown restaurants, shops and cafes within short walking distance.  the place is so \"walkable\" and well connected that after 2 days we returned our rental car and never missed it.  fantastic views of downtown skyline and bay bridge.  the apartment itself is spacious, clean and comfortable.  the kitchen had everything we needed (and more...  lots of goodies on arrival).  cute sunny private balcony surrounded by plants in the back.  extra comfortable beds.  melissa, the host, was very helpful and replied promptly to all requests for information.  simple and efficient check-in and check-out process.  great experience in all respects.our stay at melissa\\'s amazing home was simply wonderful!  the location is perfect, within easy walking distance to downtown, north beach, the wharf, etc.  the view is spectacular and the surroundings inspiring.  melissa was extremely helpful and readily available!  my only wish was to have stayed longer.  i will just have to come back soon!  thank you, melissa!this is a fantastic apartment and melissa and carlos took great care of us.  highly recommended!!  from the get-go melissa was active and very responsive is getting our arrangements set.  i couldn\\'t be more pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy family and i had a wonderful stay for over a week in this beautifully furnished apartment.  when we arrived on saturday the apartment was clean and filled with sunlight.  since we are familiar with the neighborhood we quickly unpacked and headed out on foot to our favorite places, including the ferry building for the saturday farmer’s market.  what made this apartment the perfect choice for us is its location to family a street over and that most of the places we were headed are within walking distance: north beach restaurants and shops, bustling chinatown, and (if you are inclined) fisherman’s wharf.  my sons took bart to go to the mission district to go to specific stores that are only in that area.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment itself is bright and open.  air flows nicely through the windows.  the back deck was a nice place to relax with a cup of coffee in the morning.  the kitchen is so well furnished with all the necessities that we were able to whip up some nice meals.  he views of the bay bridge are stunning and watching the fog roll in never gets old.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa\\'s house was great. clean, well stocked and in a great location. the sofa bed was not too comfortable. don\\'t try to drive there from the embarcadero.this apartment is perfect for a visit to san francisco. a great central location in a peaceful neighbourhood with views that the top hotels in the city can only dream of. everything works, is clean and as described/shown in the summary. dealing with melissa was effortless with no surprises. stay here!the property at 304 green st. was just as described.  very nice neighborhood.melissa\\'s place was wonderful and perfect for our visit. we really enjoyed being located in the midst of the telegraph hill area with so much character and scenic views. and great restaurants! melissa and carlos were super helpful and responsive. having a garage was a real bonus. as typical for this neighborhood, this unit has many steps, but the reward is amazing views of the bay/city and we had no problems. melissa was very accommodating and responsive during the check-in process and her place personifies san francisco. it has an amazing view and was just right for a weekend in town. we will be coming back!!we loved staying here!!!  i fell in love with the home when i saw the pictures, and was not disappointed.  it is a beautiful home with incredible views.  the location was perfect.  each day, we walked to neighborhood restaurants for breakfast and dinner, and enjoyed the loud and lively atmosphere.  back at the apartment, it felt like we were a million miles away - so quiet and peaceful.  \\r\\n\\r\\nwe had five adults staying at the apartment, and i was concerned that we would feel a little cramped, but as it turned out, it was not a problem.  my two daughters shared the pull-out couch and thought it was quite comfortable.  the air mattress was a back-up, but was not needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nhope to have the opportunity to stay again!seamless communication and easy stay.  great location (hills steep but views worth it) and no more than 15 minutes walk away from so much of what sf has to offer.  too tight for six people imho, but nicely appointed with parking and washer-dryer a real plus for those that will utilize themnice and quiet neighborhood with beautiful views of the city.a nice place to stay. everything clean and as advertised. you don\\'t need a gym when you live there :-)\\r\\nmelissa was helpful with recommodations over the phone.what a wonderful place! incredible view, just as pictures portray. loved looking out at bay bridge over morning coffee. very walkable to the north beach and even with kids we made it to china town and the ferry building. the beds were comfortable and kitchen well equipped. had everything we needed! would come back again!melissa and carlos were excellent hosts - being very communicative and helpful. the apartment itself was beautifully maintained and very comfortable. the kitchen was excellent, the bedrooms and beds were very comfortable and the spacious lounge area was a great place to relax. the view was amazing - during the day and night. the neighbourhood is full of great dining choices and of course lots of good bars/cafes.  highly recommended.this property is beautiful and convenient! the homepage shows the beauty of the nook at daytime, so i was surprised by the glamorous nightscape at night. melissa and carlos were very helpful and accommodating.  would stay again my next visit.melissa was very helpful in answering all of our questions. she even checked up on us halfway through to see if we needed anything. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe place was really nice and we really liked the neighborhood. it\\'s on top of a hill so if you plan on walking you\\'ll be going uphill on the way back.  the view from the living room is pretty awesome though. \\r\\n\\r\\nonly thing to note is the garage space is pretty small. we rented a dodge charger and it was a pretty tight fit. if you\\'re driving anything bigger it probably won\\'t fit. i really like melissa house, the surrounding scenery is beautiful, you can see the bay bridge, the room was very clean and full of art, as well as for guests wine and drinks, the san francisco trip very memorable.the location is truly incredible, within walking distance to many of the best parts of the city (restaurants, sights, neighborhoods, everything), and with an awesome view. the apartment is in perfect condition and very clean, and i didn\\'t have any problems at all. \\r\\n\\r\\nmelissa helped me out with all i needed and was easily accessible throughout my stay. an overall excellent experience.everything was as advertised. wonderful place and great locationin summary, we really enjoyed our stay - large, sunlit and clean place with all of the amenities described in the overview and a great location. after looking at a multitude of hotels, this unit provided a much better value at a lesser cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe check-in process was very smooth, and we were able to get in immediately upon arrival. melissa was very responsive leading up to our arrival, so we sailed right in. the champagne waiting for us upon arrival was a nice touch. also, having a garage spot was great since we had a rental car the whole time.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe unit was very comfortable with large, sunlit windows providing picturesque views of downtown sf and the bay bridge. the open living room / dining room / kitchen areas, which all look out of the large front windows, were user ready with all the necessary kitchen appliances (all modern) and a nice living room setup (flatscreen with appletv setup). wifi throughout and iphone speakers in a few rooms as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bedrooms were both very comfortable with large breezy windows (one has a nice deck, although limited view). bathroom was spotless (as was the rest of the unit), and it was nice having in-unit laundry as an option.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe definitely enjoyed the neighborhood as it had its own gems while also allowing us to easily access other sites / neighborhoods.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe would recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in san francisco and would definitely stay here again. \\r\\nmelissa\\'s apartment is extremely beautiful! what a great view, and so comfortable, clean, with everything just perfect for everyone\\'s every need. the experience of being in the area and so close to everything was absolutely great! the apartment was super clean, well equipped, functional, spacious and very well situated. the host was friendly and helpful. we really enjoyed our stay!the apartment is very well located, bright and as described.  the beds were comfortable; the apartment is very quiet even though it is close to a lively neighborhood with many restaurants.\\r\\nboth managers were very quick to respond to our questions and needs. we had an issue with the internet and carlos solved it right away.\\r\\nwe used the garage, which may be a little tricky to park into, but proved very useful since we rented a car.  (you certainly don\\'t need a car to access  downtown and other nearby areas).nice house, and the owner is so coolll~i\\'ll definitely come back again~this is a great property in an awesome location. amazing views and comfortable space. melissa was very nice and helpful!a great experience for the whole family and what made it even better staying at this flat which close to everything. the

beautifully for our arrival! we greatly appreciated the bottle of wine that she had laid out for us when we arrived. we communicated with carlos while melissa was traveling, and he was extremely quick to respond and helpful with our questions. he allowed us to store our bags in the garage when we arrived in the city earlier than 3 pm so that we didn\\'t have to carry them around with us. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment was beautifully clean and had gorgeous views. we used both of the bedrooms and the pullout couch. the beds were very comfortable, and while the pullout couch wasn\\'t as comfortable as the beds, it was okay as a pullout couch. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was perfect for us. about a 5 min walk to restarants and bars in the north beach/ little italy area, 10 min walk to coit tower, 20 min walk to the embarcadero and 20 min walk to market street. we walked and used uber to get around. the apartment is at the top of a steep hill so keep that in mind if you plan to

many of the great attractions.\\n\\nboth melissa and carlos were extremely helpful when we needed them during our trip, responding quickly to questions and providing plenty of ideas of things to do by way of a handbook.\\n\\nthe apartment is exactly as in the pictures, beautiful and easily fitting 6 people.\\n\\noverall it was a fantastic base from which we could visit all of san franciscomelissa\\'s apartment made our family\\'s stay a huge success. the place was exactly like it was described with the view from the apartment even more amazing in person. we enjoyed takeout one night, ate breakfasts in, did laundry throughout our stay, and even relaxed watching college bowl games and nfl football! the neighborhood was great as we could walk to everything. we would recommend this as well as stay here again if we are ever back in san francisco!fantastic location, we loved being able to walk around telegraph hill, to coit tower, coffee shops on columbus avenue, and to the embarcadero. the views are beautiful and the apartment is clean and comfortable. communication with melissa and her co-manager, carlos, was very easy and they responded to all our questions very quickly. overall, great experience!the views are even better than pictured - especially at night!   the skyline is beautiful, but the nightly light show on the bay bridge is captivating.  melissa\\'s place was just as advertised - spacious, well-appointed and very clean.  the location is very convenient and in a great neighborhood.  you will get your exercise walking up a steep hill to the house.  we always enjoy sf, but having a \"home\" rather than a room made this visit even better.  garage is great, but very tight if you have anything more than a mid-sized sedan.comfortable and roomy. nice views. within 20 minute walk to many neighborhoods--chinatown, downtown, fisherman\\'s wharf, north beach--little italy.  would stay again.  garage is a bit tight (not sure if a bigger vehicle would fit), but was very happy to have a place to park. highly recommended.we arrived at the lovely 2 bed apartment in north beach finding it clean, airy, light filled and as described by it\\'s owner.  crisp sheets, new towels, and in general, well maintained this unit is centrally located to my favorite part of sf.place was great! as advertised. comfortable with a great view.beautiful views of downtown and the east bay. spent most of our time walking north beach, little italy and chinatown neighborhoods, just as we planned. highly recommend a compact car, ideally with all-wheel-drive for that high slope driveway (our subaru was perfect fit). having a garage meant i had no problems running midnight errands to wallgreens. great for a family or two couples like us. not advised if you can\\'t deal with stairs or hills. thanks for making our sf visit another great memory.the place looks exactly like it is pictured on the website. both melissa and carlos are very communicative - they respond to your questions and concerns within minutes. the location is very nice too: you will be able to walk to a lot of restaurants, shops, and tourist attractions, etc. if i had to say one thing, it would be that the listing is located higher up on a hill which might be an issue if you are not used to sf\\'s hilliness. other than that, this listing is perfect. would highly recommend it! i think this house is very great, and the location is perfect!!!! this house near the china town and fisherman wharf and pier 39, and in the night you can see the beautiful city night, and that is very impressive. this house is beautiful and very comfortable, this house is perfect for people who wants to know this city and have a wonderful vacation!the condo is very nice and the views are incredible.  the location is wonderful and walking distance from chinatown, the wharf, etc..  the wine and incidental food items in the kitchen were very appreciated.  it was clear the condo had not been professionally cleaned - lots of dust bunnies and interior toilet seat was not clean.  at 4:10 am on sat., the neighbor started playing very loud music that went on for hours.  the host was out of town and her associate, carlos, was in charge.  our flight was cancelled as a result of the denver blizzard and i texted carlos to ask if there was any way to get partial refund.  i understood that wasn\\'t likely but i expected a small amount of empathy - \\'sorry that happened\\' or \\'we can refund the cleaning fee since you won\\'t be using it\\' or perhaps \\'a small discount if you can come another time\\'.  sadly, none of that to be found - just pretty much -- too bad for you.  my family drove 8 hours to slc airport to catch a flight the next day so as not to lose all our money.  all in all - the condo is nice and  great location - but there were some down sides.melissa was a great host! she coordinated all details promptly and made sure that my bosses are well briefed. my bosses loved the apartment - the location was deal, the view is amazing, the apartment is as lovely as the pictures, and the neighborhood is just perfect. we would definitely book this place again for the next trip to san fran. thanks melissa!this was a lovely place in a really nice area. we had a conference in the late afternoon. from here we were able to walk to the fisherman\\'s wharf and take a boat tour. it was refreshing! the place was very clean, and all the amenities were excellent! \\r\\nthe best in san fran!  everything was just perfect, the apartment, the neighbourhood, the views and the proximity to other places within walking distance.  would highly recommend. melissa\\'s flat was perfect.  communication was fantastic.  a great stay!melissa was terrific with all information and we felt very welcome in her apartment.  the apartment is in an awesome location - she gave us interesting sight seeing tips, info on local restaurants and shopping.  this is a lovely apartment with stunning views.great place to stay in the heart of the city.  would highly recommend this place.great location and views that match the pics and description.  nice rooms and plenty of space.  however be aware that this is a shared space and not an entire home rental. it was a very nice place to stay, awesome views, awesome structures despite lacking of a bit more of furniture, i used the space to make some work and it all went smoothly with jeremy, he was receptive and respectful. towels were clean, rooms were organized and sheets were good. it was all very laid back and pleasant. as described, incredible view and a very large and clean apartment.  i love the area too.  sf isn\\'t physically a large area so their neighborhoods are in close proximity.  cow hollow is a few short blocks to the marina district and their wonderful restaurant and shops.  what isn\\'t close is a full blown supermarket but if you\\'re not planning on cooking it shouldn\\'t matter.amazing location. beautiful apartment.jeremy\\'s place is in one of the best locations i\\'ve stayed in san francisco. he was also very accommodating and responsive. if you need a no non-sense, comfortable place in a great location, i\\'d definitely recommend it.not a good experience, as the listing for this space is incorrect.  it\\'s actually a \"private room\" apartment, not an \"entire apartment\".  while i\\'m not opposed to sharing an apartment, i don\\'t want to pay such a high price and expect the entire place, and then realize it\\'s actually shared.  not good business.although his house was great and the view from upstairs was awesome. this is not a \"entire home\" listing as the host still stays in one of the rooms. spacious and clean but not worth the price without the full privacy.correct\\r\\neven though the view and location of apartment were excellent, the lack of privacy and inability to utilize the shared spaces decreased our enjoyment immensely. the living areas (with views) were occupied by the host and his friends in the evening we arrived until we went to bed, and in the morning we encountered one of the host\\r\\ns guests sleeping on the living room sofa, again preventing us from spending any time in a room besides our bedroom. the most upsetting event of all occurred at 3;30 am, when the 2 or 3 people walked up and own the hall loudly for half an hour, with one person actually shining a flashlight into our bedroom to see if anyone was in there.  i do not recommend this airbnb rental, obviously.love it sooooooo much!! listing description was completely accurate and the 2 bedroom place was gorgeous. completely worth it and perfectly located only a few blocks from moscone.everything was as it should have been.  apartment, facility and location were perfect.  they especially liked the fitness room.  the ritz-carlton club residence was a beautiful property, extremely well maintained and the staff super helpful. the two bedroom was magnificent and very well appointed and clean. was a seamless stay and would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a place in san francisco.had a great stay, the view was wonderful. adrian is a fantastic host!  great with establishing communications and scheduling to meet.  his place is a great location and a good fit if you\\'re looking for something bit different.   great views!adrian has an excellent place in chinatown. magnificent view on san francisco and great interior design. highly recommend his place for a stay in san franciscothe apartment looks a bit old and tatter on the outside but inside was comfortable and warm.  basic appliances however are insufficient; the blanket is too small for 2 persons, there is no kettle and no hair dryer, which is really inconvenient.  when this was reported to adrian, i was told to buy one myself.  i found this reply a bit strange as american appliances are of no use in hong kong due to different voltage.adrian\\'s apartment is wonderful, just as described. the location is perfect, right in the middle of it all.  adrian was out of town when we arrived, but his friend keith met us and he was super nice.  i would stay there again in a heart beat and would recommend it to anyone!\\r\\n\\r\\nhilaryadrian was very complete in providing all necessary information for our trip.  our flight was very delayed but adrian (keith) was extremely accommodating in our late arrival and very thorough in his explanation of the flat and surrounding areas.  adrian\\'s place was very clean and awesome (in picturesque views) and also in prime central location for easy access.  i would definitely book here again!we absolutely loved our stay in adrian\\'s apartment.  describing the view as \"epic\" is an understatement.  the unbelievable view alone makes this place unbeatable.  the central location of the apartment is also great, especially if you have never been to san francisco and want to see all the best tourist areas - fairly easy walk to north beach and fisherman\\'s wharf, the financial district, and union square.  being in the middle of chinatown is really cool as well.  the décor is modern and a little funky (loved it).  the photos and description of the place are accurate and give you a very good idea of what to expect.  adrian was very very easy to communicate with and made sure we were comfortable during our stay.  his friend keith let us in and went through the features of the apartment.  he is also super friendly and helpful.  we would definitely recommend this place to others and would love to stay here again on future trips.adrian\\'s place is amazing! the views are incredible, the space was more than sufficient for 3 people, and the apartment had everything we needed for an sf weekend visit, not to mention the awesome coffee machine we used quite often :) the location was perfect for everywhere we wanted to go. there was construction across the street the whole time we were there and we never heard it from the apartment. i am definitely interested in staying at adrian\\'s place again when i come back to visit sf! easy to get in and out, and host was very good with communication.  great location ... a few blocks up from the hilton on kearney.  the view is simply magnificent.  period.  very comfortable.  good spot.  our host is very warm and welcome. adrian and his friend helped us so much through the way and i really appericiate it.adrian\\'s apartment was excellent - we\\'re so pleased we eschewed the traditional hotel experience while attending a conference in sf. the inside of the apartment is clean and homely, and the view is magnificent. easy walking distance to central sf, and chinatown was alive with locals in the food markets - a great experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nfast wifi, comfy beds, extra bedding and enough towels. there was a doorman in the lobby for the extra piece of mind. we hope to be back!adrian place was my boyfriend and my first foray into the airbnb community on our first vacation together. needless to say her place was a great choice. we loved the spectacular views of her apartment and the location couldn\\'t be more central. there was a very small disconnect at the key exchange but i think that is more due to our inexperience then anything. we had a wonderful time and my daughter  absolutely loved staying in adrian\\'s place that we can definitely recommend to others.the view might have been the best part of my trip :)the apartment is very well located and very beautiful. it is clean and the view is absolutely wonderful. the beds and furniture are very comfortable. \\nmandy made it very easy for us to access the apartment and was easy to communicate with. \\ni greatly recommend this place for a trip in san francisco. our stay in \"mandy\" in the heart of chinatown was everything we expected and more. we didn\\'t get to meet our host, adrian, but all instructions to gain access were excellent and any questions sent by text were quickly answered.   adrian accommodated our desire to gain early access and a late check out. this was very much appreciated.  the unit is bright and airy with fantastic views to the water; coit tower and alcatraz.  it is furnished beautifully. the bed is so comfortable.  loved the coffee machine.......thankyou adrian for the excellent coffee. access to netflix and the internet was also excellent. our party consisted of three adults and although only one bathroom, the second half bathroom was great.\\r\\nwe definitely recommend \"mandy\" and host adrian and would book again if available when next in san francisco. apartment has great views and located right on chinatown. coffeemaker is fantastic, other kitchen furnishings are more basic or nonexistent. would come again. i rented this on behalf of my friends so i am reporting their experience. they were really happy with the apartment, said it was nice, well-kept, as promised, with great views in the heart of the city. everything was really smooth about the check in and check out process, the keys, the coffeemaker, everything with perfect directions and everything worked perfectly. the decor is fun and easy going, and all the amenities that were supposed to be there. all around a really easy, nice rental experience. thanks!great place! loved the location and the view was absolutely amazing! adrian was a great host and provided everything we needed and more.adrian\\'s apartment was in a great part of the city --- allowing us to walk to everything we wanted to do and see -- it has fantastic views day and night and a really comfortable bed !  the smart tv and comfy seating allowed us to chill out with a glass of wine in the evening after a a day exploring !awesome place with gorgeous view in the heart of chinatown. we would definitely recommend this place. easy booking & access. clean apartment.adrian\\'s apartment is very comfortable, great place to hang out after exploring san francisco and the views are stunning. every morning you can watch the city wake up and then enjoy the lights at night. living in chinatown was a great base - vibrant during the day, quiet at night and easy to catch buses to explore the city. nice amount of space for three adults. and, of course, there\\'s the coffee! would stay here again - much more fun, attractive and charming then any hotel. we really enjoyed staying at this beautiful apartment! the view is amazing and the apartment was very chic and cool. and that coffee maker..... it was right in the middle of chinatown, which made it very easy to get so many places in san francisco. we would definitely stay here again!!adrian\\'s place is fantastic - right in the heart of china town and easily accessible for everything, with amazing views.  the description and photos are spot on and we would definitely recommend adrian\\'s place to others.  would love to come back!great place located in a nice neighbourhood .\\r\\ni didn\\'t had the chance to meet matthew but his housemate are nice and welcoming.\\r\\nthe house and view were gorgeous. matthew answered all questions i had in a timely manner. 10/10 would stay here again.matthew\\'s place was absolutely perfect for our group of 5. the views of the city, sutro tower, and twin peaks are stunning. they needed a little extra time to get set up when i arrived but they went out of their way to make sure me and my team had everything we needed for our stay. matthew was extremely easy to communicate with and even offered a pick up from the airport. the space had a full kitchen, roof deck with a bbq, and an amazing array of house plants. we slept 5 but it could easily fit 8-10 if you doubled up. the 2 master bathrooms were great. highly recommend this space for a big group trip, but you will definitely need to use uber or have a car. the hills are gnarly. the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.from the very beginning, viviane has been absolutely wonderful. she helped me with everything i needed during booking and answered all my questions very quickly. we stayed at the house for 1 week and our stay could not have been any better. cory was extremely helpful with everything and was very welcoming. milo is such a cutie and very welcoming as well. we wouldn\\'t change anything about this beautiful house and our stay. the location is extremely convenient for transportation to any part of san francisco. this was our first airbnb experience and they have definitely set the standard high for our future experiences. thank you viviane and cory for everything!viviane was a wonderful host! lele, the owner of the house, as well as milo, her cute dog, were great company as well. they were  very accommodating and made sure i had everything that i needed. the master suite where i stayed was a wonderful room with a large, clean bathroom as well as a comfy bed, tv to watch, and a balcony with an awesome view. the house is in a very convenient location as it is next to the gg park and a number of wonderful restaurants. i definitely recommend this spot for anyone visiting sf! i wasn\\'t around much but had a great stay! the host was very accommodating and the room was great just as i expected. also really convenient and easy to get to the city. i would definitely stay here again :-)lovely house, and very friendly host (and affectionate dog). there are lovely views form the house, and it is right by the park. i was really made to feel at home. the location is nice, apart from the park there are several nice restaurants and the velo rouge cafe is nice for breakfast round the corner.everything was great. the host, location, space and room. perfect set up with private room and bath, like a suite. i would certainly recommend and do again. we did not meet vuk, but his roommate was home and showed us everything. he was super nice and had some sightseeing tips for san francisco. we felt comfortable, were allowed to use the kitchen and enjoyed our stay.\\r\\nthe host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.i booked this spot on behalf of my colleagues, who said: \\r\\n\\r\\n\"we had the most wonderful stay at ed\\'s place - and the only difficulty was having to leave at the end of our week. the house is beautiful, spacious and tastefully decorated. the beds are comfortable and the street is quiet and residential yet a stones throw from valencia street and all the restaurants that you could hope for. \\r\\n\\r\\ned and veronica made us feel completely welcome and they looked after us above and beyond what we expected. i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a truly special break in a wonderful part of san francisco.\"lovely location, absolutely perfect house, great value and easy access. we were three colleagues sharing ed\\'s house and that was perfect. three couple would work equally well i think. would love to return next time in town.ed\\'s listing is spacious and bright. the three bedrooms upstairs are perfect for couples or in our case, colleagues all staying at the same place. the only odd part was that ed stays below the house and frequently come up to \"check-in\". felt more like a shared space then entire place.ed was an amazing host. the place is even more amazing than in the pictures and it was a perfectly cozy fit to be the last stop of our 12 day road trip. right between mission and valencia provides the best mix of activities you want in san francisco. specially if you are into urban life. would definitely stay here again. ed was great. booked the house in san fran for some employees that were attending a conference in the city. they thoroughly enjoyed their stay. the house was brilliant and had everything they needed for their stay. \\r\\n\\r\\ned provided great assistance with the entire booking process and provided some great tips and info about the city to both me and the employees throughout their stay. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely recommend booking properties that ed manages. \\r\\n\\r\\nnice location ; veronica was great host; trendy house\\r\\nthanksed & veronica are fantastic hosts and we enjoyed staying in their beautiful mission district home!!  neighborhood is fantastic plus veronica gave us a lengthy list of local restaurants that provided us with amazing experiences during our stay and excellent food!! i can\\'t wait to stay with them again :-)awesome host and apartment!! thanks ryan for a great week of hosting!really great stay at harmony\\'s! cozy and cute place, awesome locatation and backyard was a great spot to sit and relax! thanks for everything harmony! stephen was a great host! the home was clean, comfortable, and had great accommodations. stephen was easy to get in touch with and was willing to go the extra mile to make our stay the best it could be. our stay couldn\\'t have went better! the location was ideal with easy access to the highway and a quick ride to the city on the bart. highly recommend this stay for anyone looking to stay in san francisco!  brian was extremely kind and incorporated our last minute requests! great person! great house!beautiful home with garden in a great neighborhood. brian was a fantastic host, i felt right at home. the home was in pristine shape, the energy was warm and welcoming. i would love to stay here again. my husband and i, along with our 4 children, just returned home from an amazing one-week stay in this beautiful victorian home in san francisco.  the house was in a perfect location in the city and was a perfect spot for our family to \"live like the locals!\"  adam (our host) was very friendly and helpful as he left us detailed notes about his home and things we might like to do and see while we were visiting his exciting city. we felt quite comfortable and welcomed (and blessed!) in the taisch family home.  thank you, adam, for helping to make our vacation special by sharing your home with us!  sincerely, dana, scott, and kids\\r\\nwe had a wonderful 3 week experience at adam\\'s place. the house is even better than the airbnb\\'s pictures. it is spacious, extremelly well furnished and with new appliences. my 2 kids felt at home sleeping at the kids room. the bay view from the master bedroom is fantastic. we also enjoyed the neiborhood with great restaurants and shops close by and within a walking distance from the presisio park and the marina. bust most of all we felt welcomed by adam. he was available everytime we needed him and left all information we needed from the house. i would definitely recomend the house.      this is a five star house. the high level of finish in this lovely victorian makes this a first rate experience. the neighborhood is full of wonderful restaurants, and cool little shops. we had wonderful meals at terzo, gamine, parma and rosa\\'s. walked to the movies. the bus stop at the corner will get you most anywhere you want to go. our hosts had everything totally organized. would stay here again in a heartbeat.we loved staying in adam and veronica\\'s stunning home. it has everything a family needs, and the neighborhood could not be better. it is so lovely, so clean, and so comfortable. we can\\'t recommend it highly enough!beautiful and quiet house, perfect accommodation, located in a lovely area. good communication with owners. our family of 5 had a wonderful stay here! thxfabulous place which i can only highly recommend.\\r\\nspacious, absolutely clean, pictures do 100% represent the offer.\\r\\nlocation is one of the best in sf as per my personal preference.\\r\\neverything is within arms reach. its quiet and convenient.\\r\\nand the car-garage is a big plus.\\r\\ni will definitely come back.\\r\\ngreat apartment, great location. patrick and his roommate were both out of town for our stay so we had the place to ourselves. patrick was very accommodating regardless, being available for questions and being flexible getting the key to us through a friend. \\n\\nthe apartment is, at least to an outsider, in quite possibly the best location possible. the street car ran right out front, so getting around was easy. there was also a cvs and a trader joe\\'s across the street. \\n\\noverall we\\'re very happy with our first trip to sf and first time using airbnb. we\\'d highly recommend patrick\\'s place.great, clean place and centrally located with a trader joe\\'s right across the street.  thanks patrick.patrick is a nice, helpful guy. very flexible with the check-in process. the apartment was a bit of a letdown: slightly shabby, not quite clean. fine if you just need a bed to sleep in, but for this price i expected more.i was very happy with the guest room in melanie\\'s apartment.  it is located at one end of the apartment which makes it very private.  the bedroom is spacious, and there is a sitting room next to it which provides even more space.  the apartment was clean, well appointed, and very comfortable.  i found melanie to be a great host, and sensitive to my needs.  i would definitely return to melanie\\'s \"perfect noe valley guest room.\"\\r\\nmy stay at melanie\\'s was great. melanie was friendly and she made sure to communicate in advance and also made sure that i had everything that i needed.\\nher place is super nice, bright, clean, comfortable. i definitely would stay there again in the future if i need.the host made me feel more than welcomed. i stayed for a week so it was very important to me that it felt like home. the neighborhood was close to anything you needed, filled with restaurants, and cute drink spots!  immaculate house, great location,gracious hostess and the most adorable puppy in the world.\\nwho could ask for anything more ?\\nhighly recommendedmelanie is a friendly host who makes you feel at home and gives you your personal space. melanie maintains her house neat and clean and well organized. the house is in a beautiful and safe neighbourhood which is easily accessible by public transit. i never once had to spend on taxi while i stayed at melanie\\'s. it is also close to shopping area with lots of restaurants and good food options. i chose to buy my fresh california ingredients and cook which was fun as well. my stay was overall comfortable,safe, fun and inexpensive. i would highly recommend anybody to stay at her place.melanie made my transition to san francisco as easy as it could possibly have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nshe provided a lovely place to stay with spacious accommodations and hospitable environment including a puppy!\\r\\n\\r\\nshe provided recommendations of things to do, sights to see and places to eat. more importantly, she made you feel welcome into her home.melanie is a delightful, warm, caring and social host, who was equally as happy leaving me to do my own thing (i\\'m an introvert!) as she was to participate in the great conversations we had when i was feeling social.\\r\\n\\r\\nshe has a very good knowledge of san francisco and the bay area, so was able to offer great tips when i was organising my day trips, or just heading out and about on foot around the local neighbourhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is spacious, homey, tastefully decorated, and very well kept. melanie was very helpful regarding how everything works eg laundry, wifi, and was always glad to answer any questions i had.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is magnificent, with great views (the fog rolling in over twin peaks looks spectacular), in a well maintained neighbourhood that felt great to walk around, with just a 2-3 minute walk to essential shops and public transport. uber transport to the tourist spots eg fisherman\\'s wharf, bike rentals etc was around $15, so very accessible and affordable, and i never had to wait for more than a couple of minutes for a driver to arrive. there are plenty of local options for venturing out for food, and on nights when i ordered in, meals always arrived very quickly ie this is a great location!!!\\r\\n\\r\\noso, her puppy, is an adorable, friendly chap, who was born to make hearts melt - we became cuddle buddies from the start, which further helped make me feel at home. i miss you mate!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe usually very vocal critic in me can\\'t find a reason to fault my stay here. i wouldn\\'t change anything melanie! you have a fantastic airbnb – keep up the great work!the stay at melanie\\'s was great. she is a fantastic host, and the room was clean and with snacks in a bowl. the kitchen and the stairs to the garden is on the other end of the house making it possible not disturb anyone whilst in the kitchen. also, oso is a puppy full of character and a joy to be around. if you are not a dog person, he might change your mind. \\n\\n the location of the house is very close to safeway (5mins walk) and cool sport bar and cafes (2mins walk) . it is also close to a great small park at the end of 30th with a view to the city that should be experienced; and a 10 min walk to 24th with more shops, restaurants , and cafes. there is public transport near by which i have not tried , but walking will get you by if you have time and uber is not pricey. \\n\\nthe great time i had in san francisco was made even better by having melanie as host as she gave great advice on what to do and best ways to get around and made me feel home the entire time.i was amazed when i walked in this home.  it has been very well taken care of in the last 100 years.  the pictures on this site do not do this flat justice.  at all.  even though i rented just one room, the entire home was available for me to lounge and read in.  melanie was a very sweet host!  i thought it might be awkward sharing a home with a stranger but melanie and her adorable puppy make you feel right at home.  her house is exceptionally clean and tidy.  the bed was comfortable and i slept beautifully.  if i visit with my husband and kids, this is where i will be staying.amazing place, the staff was very accommodating and friendly, and the neighborhood was great. it was perfect for our group of 12 as we rented out a whole floor. jesse was awesome. he quickly referred me to brian who is the gm of the payne mansion. i book the rooms with ease and he explained everything up front what i would be getting. when i checked in, brain and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. he gave me a quick tour of the place. the mansion is very beautiful and up to date. the vip room was awesome. my friends and i loved it during our after party in the city. i totally recommend this place.the staff was amazing and provided everything i needed. i booked the entire fourth floor for a group of coworkers and the mansion, the rooms, especially the master suite, were beautiful. i made arrangements over the phone and everything about the stay went smoothly! definitely will stay there again and recommend it for work trips/offsites/banquets!our group had a lovely time in san francisco, it was a special trip for a wedding.  the payne mansion is in a very central location, which is great.  the staff at the payne mansion hotel were very accommodating and friendly.  the rooms were very comfortable and has been beautifully upgraded.  the small balcony looking over the neighborhood & city rooftops is ideal for your morning coffee or that evening glass of wine.  it was just perfect for our group.  a very good experience ...the house is nice... the neighborhood is safe and it\\'s easy to get anywhere around the city.we found the house we rented from james to be just exactly as listed. he was very responsive to questions both before and during our stay. the house is lovely and it was a pleasure for our family to experience staying in the richmond neighborhood. the house had been very thoughtfully set up for guests and should we find ourselves in need of that size house again would not hesitate to rent from james again. my compliments on the very elegant remodel.pam is a lovely host. she told us a lot of useful information and travelling tips in san francisco. the bedroom is beautiful and clean, just as the photos showed. everything that we needed was provided. it was a memorable trip. my family and i had the most fantastic stay at this great airbnb. this gorgeous home and it\\'s engaging hosts made our vacation in san francisco truly memorable. the two bedrooms and adjoining bath are beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. each bedroom even had a balcony/patio with panoramic views of san fran. the neighborhood was also ideal and we enjoyed walking to outstanding restaurants and delicious breakfast cafes. i cannot rave enough about this great place. we were so fortunate to stay here and know you will feel the same way. book now! once the word is out, this home will be booked solid!pam was very nice and friendly. we really enjoyed live in her lovely spaces. the rooms are exactly same as posted photos. great place to go!with the risk that this review will look like a fake one - let me give a summary of our stay and the place: \\n-  the house is amazing, in perfect condition, it is like brand new, perfectly clean and, well, there is nothing to critisize at all. \\nthe house has beautiful exterior and interior, the top floor (that is for the guests) have two terasses, this is all in the description of the place, but i think that the web pictures really does not show how nice it actually is! \\n\\ndavid, pam\\'s husband (pam was out of town, but actually called to make sure everything was fine and if we needed something) was more than helpful during our stay, preparing breakfast and very responsive to my daughters preferences (he literally went out to get more grapes when he learned they like that!)\\n\\nhe gave tips and recommendations about what to do and see, borrowed us a guide book, had a binder with additional information about restautants etc. he even gave us a ride downtown when we left for la. the hosts really go the extra mile for their guests. \\n\\nbathroom was excellent, towels, soap etc all in place and also sodas, bottles of water, a coffee machine etc all complimentary. we could use the kitchen, which again, as the rest of the house, was nice and clean and there was everything we needed. \\n\\nin summary, the best place i have ever stayed at. and quite frankly, even though the price is not \\'cheap\\', we need to remember that this is san fransisco, and given the value you get, i would say that you get a lot more than you pay for, which is very, very rare. \\n\\nif this would have been a hotel it would have been a luxury suite for sure, with the cost increased by a multiple of five at least. \\n\\ni cannot give a stronger recommendation. \\n\\nlarsthe host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.i enjoyed staying at jennifer\\'s apartment in the russian hill area. the location is amazing! there are lots of great restaurants and bars nearby . lombard street is a five minute walk from the apartment and fisherman\\'s wharf is also a short walk away. jennifer was a great host and always responded to my questions within minutes. i would recommend jennifer\\'s apartment to anyone traveling to san francisco.  very clean and comfy room, the place was centrally located. jennifer made sure i had everything i needed and was super nice. i would stay here again when visiting sf.kevin\\'s place is really beautiful. 4 private bedrooms make it great for a larger group. we were there for work and used the dining table as a conference table. kevin was really helpful with allowing us to ship some large work related boxes to his office in advance and even brought them to the house for us at check in. as we were the first guests in this newly renovated rental, there were a few glitches with lack of blinds and hot water, but kevin worked quickly to try and rectify everything. we will definitely return!this was one beautiful property in a convenient location of sf, and kevin\\'s hospitality certainly made our stay a much more pleasant experience. the house is stylish and featured with many great amenities such as upscale kitchen, home theatre, smart tv, etc. it is also spacious, which is good for family, and accessible to many great restaurants and bars in mission district. the house itself has no doubt in quality, but what makes it stands out is the friendly and helpful host, kevin. he answered our calls/massages in a timely fashion and willingly tried his best to accommodate our arrival/departure time. we\\'ll certainly stay here again next time visiting sf. the house was absolutely beautiful.  mint condition.  i rented it for 4 guys coming to town for our company\\'s meeting.  right in the mission, but on a fairly quiet street.  we coordinated in advance to meet with kevin before the official check-in time, but he was delayed for an hour and we ended up having to wait for him, which was a bummer.  the people visiting his house were not let in on time, and overall, the process was not that reliable.  pros - \\r\\n\\r\\nlocation\\r\\nlinens\\r\\nnumber of rooms\\r\\n\\r\\ncons -\\r\\n\\r\\naging house/furnishings\\r\\ncommunication, timingi booked this house for my colleagues who were in town for dreamforce, they absolutely loved it! i had some other colleagues in a hotel nearby & they were all very jealous that they did not get to stay in this house! it was very spacious & easy to get to at all hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nvalentino does take a long time to get back to some emails (which worried me a little), but he did call me the night before the reservation was due to start. the check in was smooth, he was waiting for my colleagues when they arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would definitely book again the next time we have a few guys in town for business, thanks!!this was a great place for our group of 4 business colleagues to stay. 2 of the rooms had ensuite bathrooms & 2 rooms shared a bathroom, which was fine. the location is terrific-- up powell street, just before you reach california. the cable cars come rumbling by all day/night, which adds to the charm but, warning, it can be difficult for light sleepers (2 of us needed to pop in ear plugs but that was ok). \\r\\nvalentino is a little slow to respond but he\\'s a person of his word & was accommodating when we wanted to check out an hour later & even when we had some difficulties with the hot water he attended to it immediately.\\r\\na few things to note: there are no tvs in the home whatsoever. we\\'d hoped to watch the presidential debate but ended up live-streaming it on our computers (there is high-speed wi-fi). the home wasn\\'t ready at the time we specified so there was a bit of a wait. there were also a lot of items left in the fridge & i\\'m not sure if that was for convenience or it wasn\\'t cleaned out. \\r\\notherwise, great place, nice stay, excellent location. just be prepared from some street & cable car noise. 3 of us stayed here after deciding to attend a large conference at late notice and most of the hotels where booked out.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe good:\\r\\nwell located close to union square and most of the san fran night life\\r\\nlost of space, with 4 large-ish rooms\\r\\n\\r\\nthe not so good:\\r\\ndue to a data mix-up (not ours) the house wasn\\'t cleaned yet when we arrived, so we had a 4 hour wait to get in\\r\\naging house/furnishings that could do with some maintenance\\r\\nmissing the basics most airbnb places have: no bath mats, no toiletries, one towel per guest\\r\\nmay have been because of the last minute clean, but there was an overpowering smell of cleaner/deodorizer in the air for the whole 3 days \\r\\n\\r\\nall in all for the money, probably not up to scratchideal location in san francisco. valentino was extremely responsive to our needs and made sure that our stay was a success. \\r\\n\\r\\nhotels were tight in sf, so this home was a great option and worked well for the four of us. there was plenty of room and a well-supplied kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only downside is the noise from the cable cars (and that is only a problem in the front two bedrooms). if you are accustomed to nyc traffic noise, this won\\'t bother you at all. however, earplugs are recommended for light sleepers.\\r\\nvalentino\\'s mini mansion was a great location for my team of 4 co-workers to stay at for 7 days. it\\'s located fairly close to a bart station near some great shopping. the powell-hyde historic cable car runs right outside, so hop on if you get tired of walking up the hill. internet access was important to us, so we were happy that the wifi worked without problems. valentino was a great host who responded quickly to all inquiries. we had a great time!we rented this space for some employees visiting sf for a conference. though it was a bit difficult to communicate about the check-in and the furniture is tired. note: there aren\\'t any tvs\\r\\nthis is a fantastic house in a first class location. the house is beautiful and really has all the mod cons...not that any one of the 4 men staying there used many of them! valentino the host was also great, a true gentlemen, offering help and advice throughout our stay. i could not recommend this house more.valentino´s mini mansion is an ideal location for visiting/working downtown sf.\\r\\nwe (4 co-workers) stayed there for 7 days and valentino was extremely responsive to our needs and made sure that our stay was a success.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a great time!\\r\\nvalentino and his spectacularly located mini-mansion were top-notch.  the 4-bedroom residence handled 7 of us with ease, and the fact that the rooms were spread out over three-floors of living space gave everyone plenty of room.  easy living!  valentino himself was very easy to get a hold of, and answered any questions we had immediately.  true gentleman.\\r\\nthe building and it\\'s location are quintessential sf, with all the history a 1920\\'s building can convey.  the cable cars outside were not only incredibly entertaining to watch, but were never too loud to be distracting.  being two blocks from grace cathedral and it\\'s gorgeous park (with brand-new playground included), and 4 blocks from union square and it\\'s hustle and bustle, we were in heaven.  \\r\\nif you\\'re looking for a brand new, pristine, fancy living quarters, rent elsewhere.  if you\\'re looking for a historic masterpiece, complete with what seems to be many of its original windows, stained-glass windows, structural embellishments, some furniture, and bathroom and doorknob fixtures, ... mixed with some new and very comfortable couches and beds... this is your place.  sure, no tv, garage, or clothes washers, but hey - you\\'re in san francisco.  no time for tv, parking in one spot, or chores.  thanks, valentino, for a really great week.  it was perfect.       the house is in a fantastic location.  short walk down the hill in either direction to north beach or union square.  the 4 beedrooms share 3 bathrooms so that\\'s nice.  the living space is not huge and there is no tv (as mentioned elsewhere) but it was comfortable for myself and my colleagues to share.this location was a great place. it was clean and well maintained. it was very close to downtown and an easy walk to the conference center and to the wharf is a little further :) its right on the cable car street which is great to catch the cable car but the bell starts to ring early. closing the windows removed the cable car noise allowing late morning starts.home was immaculate.  owner accommodated us and had someone meet us at the house at 11pm to let us in, which was much appreciated.  everything was as advertised.\\r\\n\\r\\nhome has a lot of charm and the location is very good for union square.  the walk to the office in soma was easy.  the walk back from union square requires walking uphill for a few blocks, so keep that in mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nhad to call the owner because could not figure out front door lock.  he picked up immediately and was very helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home is a older, so the road and cable car noise were noticeable, but not overwhelming.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall it was a great stay.  i would recommend it.fantastic house and experience!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe were lucky to find a place at all during oracle week in san francisco.  our group was 4 men traveling to a conference.  the 4 bedroom setup worked perfectly for us.  lawrence, who acclimated us to the house when we arrived was great the whole time we were there, keeping the house clean, making recommendations for dining and entertainment and making sure we had everything we needed during our trip.  location was convenient and easy for our travels around town as we were busy during the whole stay.  the house is very comfortable and flows easily.  full kitchen makes life easier also.  \\r\\n\\r\\non the whole, our stay at the spectacular nob hill mini mansion was indeed \"spectacular!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhost, made us feel very comfortable!  beautiful home and area!! definitely would rent from again.  thank you so much!  pros:  exceptional location.  clean, well maintained facilities including clean sheets, towels and amenities such as shampoo, soaps, etc.  beds were made each day and gentleman named lawrence who took care of the unit was polite and professional.  phenomenal water pressure for showers.  the sitting area was perfect for the 4 of us and for informal business meetings.  wifi was superior throughout our stay.    \\r\\n\\r\\ncons:  we arrived promptly at 3pm per the strict instructions of the host and found the place wasn\\'t available and still be cleaned.  we returned at 5pm and the place was only semi-available and still being cleaned.    when i went to bed that evening around midnight, the sheets on my bed were freshly cleaned, but in the rush to make up the place, they were still damp.  i had to sleep on towels to stay dry - not a bid deal, but not exactly what you expect for $1000 per night.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s a walk up to the main floor and then there\\'s two bedrooms on floor 3 and two more bedrooms on floor 4.  the bedrooms on floor 4 share a bath with a shower smaller than any i\\'ve encountered in the us.  not a problem for us, but probably something people should know.  \\r\\n\\r\\nothers have described the decor as \"tired\" and i would agree though it\\'s clean throughout and relatively comfortable.  seeing a comment from a prior visitor of \"spectacular\" seems misleading to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nnot sure why no one mentioned it before, but the place has a bad smell - i\\'m not one to be bothered by that sort of thing normally, but it\\'s ever present - it was referenced in one other review as an \"overpowering smell of cleaner/deodorizer\", but i\\'m not sure i\\'d describe the odor in the same fashion - one of our guests used the term \"musty\".  the smell is probably my biggest complaint.\\r\\n\\r\\non balance, it\\'s a tough call on whether i\\'d stay here again - having not yet determined the relative market value of this option, i guess it would depend upon my alternatives.  we had a great stay. valentino was very flexible with check-in and check-out. a lot of credit goes to lawrence, who let us in, gave us our keys, made our beds, swapped out our towels, gave us directions, suggested restaurants, and did everything you could imagine to make our stay the best it could be. the apartment itself is really spacious and comfortable, though as an older building it does have its quirks. it\\'s a tad musty, but we just aired it out a little and it was fine. it\\'s incredibly convenient to be right on the cable car line, though i will say that it can be kind of noisy in the front rooms—nothing that earplugs can\\'t fix. overall, i highly recommend this place, especially for the price. infinitely better than a hotel. it\\'s authentic san francisco in every way.valentino replied quickly to texts, & i was excited by the pictures - but the place is truly remarkable. it\\'s literally a stone\\'s throw, less than half a block, from some of the city\\'s most upscale hotels, perched on the side of an incredible hill. the pictures don\\'t do it justice - it\\'s beautiful. an old grande dame of a building. beautiful light, clean and welcoming. any time i travel to sf with a group again, or with family, i will stay here. personally i have issues with the host because he had agreed to a reduced rate and then wouldn\\'t credit us the difference back until i got airbnb involved.  also he refused to give us the location of the house until 2 hours before we arrived which really caused great difficulty for us since we were arriving from different countries. the location was great, but i definitely wouldn\\'t call it a mansion.  not even close.  it is an older san francisco home in need of repair.  the stained glass windows are taped together and we couldn\\'t close the window in our bathroom which left you open to viewers when taking a shower.  the kitchen is no more than a pantry style from years gone by.   you need to take your own bars of soap as none are provided.  the bathroom on the top floor has an extremely small shower stall, no tub, and was difficult for an adult man to shower in.  valentino was never to be seen or heard, but his \"caretaker\" lawrence did his best to make us comfortable. - very helpful in accommodating extra people, providing air mattresses, changing sheets during the stay etc.\\r\\n- nice house, good communal spaces for sitting together in the evening, great location\\r\\n- i\\'d personally rather have spent less money even if it meant a less luxurious setting, but i knew what i was getting.we stayed here during a conference and the place was great. couldn\\'t have asked for a better location or house. lawrence is the house care taker and was very accommodating. the shower upstairs is small, but even our 6\\'4\" guy can managed to make it work.  i\\'d recommend this house to anyone visiting. great place, and the location cannot be beat. the place is old school sf which is exactly what we wanted. we had four people that slept well and comfortable for four nights. \\r\\n\\r\\nno detail was left unnoticed, all our needs were anticipated and met! \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you!this place was incredible. the host was very nice and accommodating. they made it work for 6 people. i would highly recommend this place for any group coming to sf.absolutely stunning house in a great location. packed full of period features, lovely furniture and stylish touches. \\r\\n\\r\\nvalentino was a great host, very helpful with restaurant recommendations and we even had our beds turned down each day.\\r\\n\\r\\nsurrounding area has good restaurants, great coffee and enough bars and craft ale to keep you going. 10 mins from union sq down the hill. expect a hard walk back as it\\'s very steep but if you can\\'t handle that there\\'s always the cable car. \\r\\n\\r\\nwill book again when next in the city\\r\\nower is welcoming us at house and introduce us their house. and show us around.  its really helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat house and owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nlove it.we loved this house. it\\'s full of old world charm and i\\'d say the photographs don\\'t do it justice. it\\'s extremely spacious (though with a relatively small kitchen/dining area) and has lots of beautiful features such as stained glass windows. the location is also wonderful; a nice neighbourhood with lots of good restaurants, and an easy walk to union square shops etc. \\n\\nthe down side of it being so central is that it\\'s noisy but nothing that a pair of ear plugs wouldn\\'t solve. \\n\\nthe house comes with a very attentive caretaker, which makes it like a well serviced hotel and was more than i\\'d expected. \\n\\noverall, i would stay here again if i was visiting sf with family. valentino\\'s nob hill mini mansion truly exceeded our expectations.  ours was a family group of six aged 16 through 74; we had room to be together in the lovely and comfortable living room (great street view) and also room for privacy with four bed rooms.  the location could not have been more convenient - cable cars run on the street in front.  we could walk to many of our destinations and public transportation was very convenient.  lawrence had good visitor advice including the recommendation of one of our favorite restaurants and  he also kept the house in great condition without being obtrusive.  nice view of new year\\'s eve fireworks from the top of the hill one half block away.  all in all a great experience. \\r\\nwe had several executives staying in town for the jp morgan conference.  this house was incredibly roomy, comfortable and in a wonderful location.  valentino was a terrific host and very prompt with communications.  highly recommend! great location and place. we were in for a conference and couldn\\'t ask for a better place. lawrence is a great guy and made sure we had everything we needed.this is our second time in the space and it was excellent. we will be staying here again. valentino and lawrence were very accommodating to us and made the stay wonderful.great stay. very helpful. perfect locations.valentino was a gracious host!great house, shared with 3 other work colleagues and although we didn\\'t spent much time in the area it was a perfect set up, 2 bathrooms en-suite on the second 2nd floor and 1 shared between the 2 rooms on the top floor. the kitchen had what you would need, again, we didn\\'t really use but all clean. towels and shampoo / soap was all left in the bathrooms which was a nice, also i was able to check in a couple of hours early which was also helpful.\\r\\ni would totally recommend the housegreat spot to setup for a few days in the citygatz was so wonderful as was our stay in the looky home.  wonderful location for my wife and i to base our sf getaway out of.  right in the middle of the best food and drinks in the city, but the homey feeling of the apartment tied it all together.  loved staying with business people from all over the world and learning about other cultures that i thought i knew about before.  thanks gatz!due to some airbnb issue (instant book was turned on) the location was not available but gatz found a space in the mission property. the place is very clean, with lots of highly convenient amenities (washer/dryer, a work space, a separate leisure space, a large fridge and everything needed to cook, shared supplies like coffee, etc.) the manager was extremely friendly as well.\\r\\n\\r\\ngatz let me store my luggage before my very early morning flight (i no longer needed a bed), which was great as it also allowed me to do some extra work.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would be happy to stay again at any property managed by gatz; everything about it says care, convenience and quality.the description is precise and the host gave us a warm welcome when we first arrived. i highly recommend this apartment to those who want to stay in san francisco for a few days. the apartment is very clean and the people are super nice. there is even a gym room on the 2nd floor and is free to the residents. \\r\\non the other hand, there are many decent restaurants nearby. transportation is convenient. everything is just too good for visitors like us. looky home is an amazing place to live both for short term and long one. the place is entirely clean, and all of your roommates are carefully chosen so they are nice and professional. at nights most of them kept quiet and people respect each other here. it is located at the very convenient soma area so i would say it is close to everything. the view is fantastic - you can see the beautiful sf buildings as well as mountains far away. what is the best part, about lookyhome, is that your host, gatz, is quite a pleasant guy and is always trying to accommodate your needs. when i have a chance to travel back here i will definitely stay again. i strongly recommend this place.everyting is clean and well organized in a room. we can enjoy nice view from high-rise building. people are cozy and quiet at night. convenient area with only 5min walking from muni and bart station. trader joe\\'s is only 15min walking.ha sido una experiencia agradable pues el ambiente fue ameno en mi estancia, todos fueron amables desde el anfitrión y todas las personas dentro de casa.\\r\\n\\r\\nes muy recomendable para tener una estancia largai definitely enjoyed my stay in the looky house. the house is super clean and one of the best airbnb place that i have stayed in. heigo was very helpful in making sure that we feel comfortable in the house. the house is located very near the civic centre bart. convenient to walgreens and several fast food chainsthe apt is great, very clean, modern and spacious. the bedroom is a bit tight, but it matches the description. every week there are cleaning people do the cleaning. also, gym is great.great experience, great host. enjoyed my stay.robert is really kind and friendly host! he is very knowledgeable about sf. the room was large and clean. i slept well because neighborhood was very quiet and safe. 10 minutes by walk to bart station and you can go downtown by another ten minutes by bart. i forgot my shaver at his place, but he sent it to my place very quickly. thank you!! i recommend this place to anyone visiting san francisco!robert was a great host - very friendly and welcoming and provided everything i needed. the neighbourhood is quiet and only a few minutes walk from glen park with bart and buses, coffee shops, grocery store and a bar.rob was very welcoming, responsive and made an excellent experience. his place was as described and both very comfortable and  convenient.  great guy, and great place!my favorite thing about robert\\'s place is the ample street parking. i always got a spot right in front. his pug will try to escape out the front door so do be careful upon entering. robert is a really amazing guy. made me feel very welcome in a new city. location is a great little house away from the business of the city, but very easy to get to wherever you want to go. definitely recommended!a nice place to stay: quiet, comfortable, and within easy walking distance from the glen park bart station.  glad i stayed here!robert is nice and easy to communicate. except for making me feel at home, he also told me a lot about where to go in the city. by the way, i really like his place. the house has its own style. good location, parking and room. helpful host. robert is a nice  host, open minded, fun. i played his drums . his house is beatiful and the room is cute. nice room in quiet neighborhood- away from downtown but perfect for folks i was visiting. my flight was delayed and i arrived after midnight but robert arranged for key and left lights on in my bedroom and bath to make it easy to settle in.  it was easy to find street parking outside - about 1/2 mile walk to bart station, local shops, etc. for morning coffee or to get downtown.   he was hosting lovely older dog that weekend - so overall its a better place if you are a dog person (or ok with dogs).  but he\\'d let me know beforehand -- so all good with me!  \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d definitely stay there again!robert was really chill and staying at his place definitely eased my transition into living in san francisco. less than 15 minutes to bart station, and having an onsite washer/dryer really helped. i would like to have stayed longer if i could.robert is very warm and pleasant.  he was there when i checked in.  the place was exactly as described. the location is really convenient.  tasha (and her room mate alex) was a great host. i felt welcome to share the home and everything i expected from an accommodation was there.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy greatest pleasure was the view from their balcony where i could rest for a while in the sun and just feel happy :-)we had a wonderful time at tasha\\'s place.  her apartment is situated right in the heart of the castro, offering a plethora of restaurants, bars and cafes from which to pick.  the apartment is clean, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable.  we felt at home from the very beginning.  also, her view cannot be beat.  you get a stunning view of twin peaks and the surrounding hills.  we will definitely stay in tasha\\'s place again.  thank you for everything, tasha!we had a fantastic time in tasha\\'s home!  it\\'s a wonderful place and she is a perfect host!  we had an amazing time at this place. it is great located and there is a lot to see in the

quiet stay in an unbeatable location.  i really had a wonderful experience. it was my first time using airbandb and really enjoyed the experience. tasha has been an incredible host. her place is very cute, full of light and the location just perfect. it was very easy to communicate with tasha, she responded very fast to my emails and questions. i\\'ll be back!the sweet spot is in a great location,

around you. tasha is also really helpful and will  answer any questions you may have and offer good recommendations.ideal location, great neighbourhood, nice house, friendly host . tasha gave us usefull tips for breakfast and dining. free overnight parking in the street. recommend it only a pity that is wasn\\'t very clean.fabulous location, the best spot in whole san francisco! i was so happy to book a room at tasha\\'s house, it enhanced my experience in the city a great deal. perfect surroundings, nice streets, gorgeous victorian houses, plenty of restaurants, bars and shops around the corner. tasha is the perfect host, super attentive and ever so nice, we really bonded and i can say that she\\'s now my friend! it was important for me to have a daily connection with the host as i was traveling on my own and cherished some company. i can say tasha is simply amazing, friendly, out going and supportive. the house is beautiful, very sunny with lots of natural light, spacious and clean. a big kitchen with all sort of appliances and a great deck with stunning views of the city! the room was lovely, lots of closet space, exquisite decoration, clean and a super comfortable king size bed. i had an amazing experience here and i will repeat without a doubt!very good location, nice apartment, but when we were there not very clean. also for this price (on the contrary to some other airbnb places we stayed in san francisco), there was no breakfast included.we had an awesome time staying with tash in her lovely house. her and her boyfriend were so helpful and gave us heaps of great tips of where to go and where to eat out, we felt really welcome in their home. the house was in a perfect location, so close to the castro. the deck was a lovely place to sit in the sun and eat breakfast and the views from it are amazing. we absolutely loved our stay in san francisco and would definitely stay with tash  if ever we\\'re in town again!very nice house lovely furnished, with supersundeck. tasha boyfriend was very helpful with tips around the city.tasha is a wonderful host and her appartment is gorgeous. it\\'s right in the castro, just one block to the main street, and also an easy walk to the mission to hang out in dolores park.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe appartment was super clean and comfortable with the added bonus of an amazing deck at the back of the building\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!wonderful place to stay in san francisco in a really cool neigbourhood!\\r\\nstaying with tasha was our first airbnb experience. i\\'m ready to book another trip!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe wanted to visit san francisco and as through we lived there. we couldn\\'t get a hotel nearby and tasha\\'s home was exactly where we hoped to be. \\r\\n\\r\\ntasha and anish had the most amazing food and coffee recommendations. we had about 5 great recommendations for every meal. some places were too busy with lines around the block but others were ready to seat us. i felt like like an insider because i avoided the lines and still found a great place to eat. to me, that was the epitome of \"living\" in the place. we adapted and enjoyed the surroundings, learning where to go and when.\\r\\n\\r\\ntasha\\'s home was close to everything we wanted to see, though we did explore the city quite a bit. i felt comfortable the entire time and would definitely recommend her home (and advice!) to anyone visiting the area.great apartment, and seriously fantastic bed. indeed is a perfect location, close to great restaurants (esp zadin and samovar tea lounge) and to public transport.  thanks for a great stay! unfortunately i was not able to meet tasha. however i meet the landlady of the flat, who was more than helpful with everything. even that this was my last stay of this trip and therefore saw most of the sights of san francisco, she was able to give one more tip before leaving this city. the place itself is very well situated and designed in a warm and welcoming ambiente. to whom might stay at this house next and wants to enjoy a very good french restaurant i recommend you to go \"france\\'s\" on 17th and noe street. tash has a nice appartement and great bed ! our stay was perfect ;-)was an amazing place and a great location.   tasha is very kind and an outstanding hostess.   would love to return .. great place, great host!!tasha was very nice, friendly and always willing to help with questions and suggestions to where to go in sf. the location is also really nice and close to great places to eat, park, transportation etc... place is really quiet and safe.we had an amazing stay! tasha was really nice and helpful. we fall in love with the beautiful apartment which was very clean and cozy. the location is perfect. wish we could stay longer...t was my first airbnb experience and i was pleased.  i stayed during the halloween weekend and the weather was abnormally  warm and nice for late october (according to my sf native friends). tasha’s place was just another nice addition to my perfect weekend getaway. \\r\\n\\r\\nroom: \\r\\nmy room was bright and airy and there were clean towels and a couple of umbrellas and a stack of interesting books.  the deck had an amazing view; wish i had time to enjoy some relaxing reading time there. \\r\\n\\r\\nlocation:\\r\\ni was able to take muni to virtually everywhere, ranging from the ocean beach to downtown san francisco.  if you are coming from the airport, you can take bart to this place.  too many good restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood to choose from.  organic grocery store was just 5 minutes away. \\r\\n\\r\\nhost & hostess:\\r\\ni didn’t stay home much other than for sleeping at night and for brief napping and change of clothes during the day.  and tasha and boyfriend were always out and about so i had the house all to myself most of the time.  my only concern was that they came home late on saturday night and were pretty loud (i got home 1pm, so it must be later than that).  i didn’t care for being woken up in the middle of the night like that when three-hour time difference had already threw me off a bit (i live in est zone). \\r\\n\\r\\noverall,  it was much better than staying at an overpriced hotel room downtown and you should try, too! great location, beautiful place, and courteous hosts. worked well for us when the in-laws were in town — they stayed at our place, we stayed here. it was amazing to stay in tasha\\'s house. the couple were so polite with me. i felt at home all the time. the location was perfect for me. if i decide to come back to san francisco again, i am sure i am gonna booking in the same place.i stayed with tasha for my first two months living in sf, and couldn\\'t have asked for a better room or roommate. the apartment and its location are perfect, with a ton of great cafes/restaurants/bars nearby, not to mention dolores park, and useful stuff like laundry, post office, grocery stores etc. tasha was friendly, generous, considerate, and went above and beyond to help me settle in to the city - can\\'t thank her enough! the reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.friendly, welcoming hosts in a clean apartment. neighborhood is convenient for work or play - i am a local and was staying at greg\\'s while in between apartments so it was great to be close to the embarcadero for a run, russian hill for my favorite cafes, and downtown for work.greg and his roomies are terrific.  location was perfect and room great.  had a wonderful stay and highly recommend the place.i felt really warmly welcomed by greg and his flat mates. they offered to share their groceries and all spent time talking to me and getting to know me. it felt like living in a shared flat with three nice house mates for a night. the room was what it looks like on the picture, i enjoyed the natural light. the apartment was quite clean, cleaner than what one would expect of a place with three guys. there was a common kitchen and living room to hang out. the street was quiet, the neighborhood seemed up-scale although i am not an expert on san francisco. i definitely felt safe there. overall my experience was great and i\\'ll try to get something very similar next time i use airbnb.greg and his roomies are the perfect hosts! they were very welcoming and happy to answer all my questions about where to go and what to do. the room is small but cozy and the bed is very comfy. the apartment is clean and charming and the neighborhood (north beach/telegraph hill) is awesome.lots of cafés and restaurants just around the corner and just a short walk to everything else. i can highly recommend this room, and i would definitely stay there again!if you are considering staying with greg and his roommates: definitely go for it! i stayed at their place for a month and they really made it feel like a home away from home, being super friendly and just a bunch of very nice people. the room is cosy and clean and you´ll find eveything you need for a pleasant stay in the apartment. furthermore the location is just awesome, being pretty close to almost everything in sanfran.my stay was excellent. greg was a gracious host and offered great advice on what to do/see in sf. he also lent his time to talk about what it\\'s like to live and work in sf. greg made the logistics of getting situated very simple. this was important because my flight in to sf kept getting delayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is great. only a mile from the financial district if you are staying there for business. the room itself is small but clean and bright.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this was well worth the price paid and will be my first airbnb choice for staying in sf in the future.greg was a perfect host. he was very considerate und helpfull, e.g. to find a copy shop where to print my poster, but also on every other occasion. his (sensitive contents hidden) were also very friendly and nice. my stay was uncomplicated and comfortable. the apartement has everything that i needed. i loved the neighbourhood with plenty nice italian cafes and a small park where older chinese ladies exercise in the mornings to cheesy pop music. the neighbourhood is very lively and reminds me a little bit of kreuzberg in berlin. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks for everything, guys. merry christmas and a happy new year 2015!the reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the reservation was canceled 18 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the room was cozy and the host greg and his friends were a very friendly group of people. the location is perfect for foodies or people who enjoy the night life. lots of amenities within walking distance.a frequent airbnb guest, i can say that the property and the service were absolutely top notch!  the property is spacious and gorgeously appointed.  the kitchen is a joy to cook in and the living room feels like a magazine spread.  olivier and alexandra were beyond perfect hosts--even going so far as to leave personal touches like french macaroons and high-quality personal care products for our stay!  in the mornings, i did yoga on the little back porch with the hammock and a tree.  perfection.  alexandra was the perfect hostess; so considerate and responsive and thoughtful to all our guests\\' needs (even the children\\'s!). her place is amazing and was perfect for our group. i look forward to booking her space again!i can recommend olivier`s and alexandra`s house to everyone!\\r\\njust amazing.\\r\\nthank you again!\\r\\nbest, ute saying that olivier and alexandra have a lovely home is an understatement. it is absolutely flawless. natural light canvases every corner of the house, especially if one allows the california breeze to dance through the double back doors, which are adjacent to a picturesque porch shaded by lemon trees. decor and modern white furnishings were smartly chosen for each individual space, making every room feel as if it was uniquely your own. each of my nine guests were treated to a mint adorned pillow and celebratory champagne upon arrival. a gourmet kitchen, a grand dining table, and five bedrooms allowed entertaining a large group of ten seamless. \\r\\n\\r\\nolivier and alexandra were fabulous hosts, and were very communicative throughout our stay. they especially helped with our last minute booking as our previous reservation had been cancelled within 24 hours of our arrival. the trip\\'s success was truly in the details of our gracious hosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nevery san francisco memory will have a beginning, but the ones really worth remembering will only start here. one of the most beautiful homes i\\'ve ever stepped into in san francisco. beautiful layout, gorgeous backyard, great hospitality by the hosts. couldn\\'t ask for anything more out of the experience for me and my colleagues who were visiting town. a+ all-round. lovely home in a great location with gracious hosts!gorgeous house in a beautiful neighborhood.  olivier and alexandra were very friendly and attentive owners.  they were extremely welcoming and helpful.  we had a wonderful experience all around and would highly recommend this house.  would love to go back ourselves one day.  we (two families of together 10 people) had a great time in olivier and alexandra\\'s house! olivier is a wonderful and flexible host, and it is very easy to communicate with him. he welcomed us and introduced us to his house, showing us all the rooms, facilities, and the impressive garden with a cute little working cottage and a nice outdoor terrace. the neighborhood is very convenient with easy public transport connections to downtown san francisco, and a number of attractive restaurants and shops nearby. the house itself is beautiful, very nicely decorated with comfortable bedrooms and bathrooms, and a very modern and convenient kitchen. we can definitely recommend this house to any family or group who wants to enjoy a comfortable stay in san francisco.  this is the second time i\\'ve booked with olivier & alexandra and the experience keeps getting better with each booking. they are extremely responsive and considerate of our needs and so flexible with our schedules. the home is an oasis in such a busy city and wonderfully appointed with everything you need. i cannot wait to book again! olivier and alexandra were such wonderful hosts.  the communication was excellent, and they worked with our changing schedules.   alexandra met us at the house with a welcoming hug and gave us a tour that made our stay that much easier.  the house was just beautiful; we all enjoyed our stay very much!  hope to book again when we next visit san fran!!we were 2 families each with a daughter staying at the noe valley house. it was such a great space for children as they had a great playroom with toys and a tent and a string of lights for atmosphere. the girls also loved the backyard area and playing on the porch. the rooms and beds were very comfortable, and there were plenty of towels and extra sheets if needed. we cooked a lot while we were there and it was especially thoughtful of our host to supply the kitchen with juice, coffee, eggs and yogurt drinks for the little ones and cupcakes!! everything went smoothly, we had no issues with anything, wi-fi and parking out front. we explored the neighborhood with our host recommendations, and it was all great. of course it helps sf is so beautiful and the air feels so fresh (we are from nyc). also at the very end of our stay my sister-in-law discovered she left her wedding band behind, and our host graciously got their cleaner to help find it, and an extra necklace to boot! very grateful for their help and honesty in finding the missing jewelry. we can\\'t say enough great things about the space and our hosts, you will love, it, and want to move there!oliver was such a kind host, taking us to a tour of the house and explaining us what we could find in the house.\\r\\nthe house was big and beautiful, with a nice bbq that we used for a dinner, we are a group of 9 persons. description of the house also fit really well with what we have found.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood was quiet, the only regret is that we stayed for only 2 nights!\\r\\nwonderful host and wonderful property. though i was called away on business my staff had a wonderful trip! thanks for everything. loved the communication! we stayed at alexandra and oliver\\'s house for two weeks when we visited our family in san francisco. the house is in a lovely and safe neighbourhood, centrally located near 24th street with lots of nice little cafés. it is clean, well equipped and we really enjoyed having our dinner in their lovely garden. my two little girls have enjoyed their stay as well. it is a really nice house and i would highly recommend it. gorgeous home with plenty of sleeping space!the house is beautiful and very kid friendly. my nephew loved the playroom on the top floor. olivier was a great host and there were nice little touches throughout such as the cooking supplies. only downside is there\\'s no bathroom on top floor near the king sized bed but there is one the next floor down. overall very happy with the experience!the house was great! the pics are very accurate. olivier and alexandra were very responsive, flexible and easy to work with. we are local, but had our family in town for our wedding and they stayed in the house together.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place was perfect for multiple families and had a fantastic back patio area. there was plenty of space to gather on the main floor and it was awesome having the kitchen, dining room, and living room all open to each other. \\r\\n\\r\\nloved the walk to 24th street shops & restaurants and the kids loved the small park less than a block away, they kept begging to go back. only drawbacks were that it\\'s not super accessible to downtown via public transportation (but doable) and the street was busier than anticipated, but neither were a big deal. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe\\'d definitely recommend the place! we really enjoyed our stay! our group loved staying and olivier & alexandra\\'s.  the house was beautiful and more than comfortably fit our group of 6!  the group was in sf for a work week in our local office - the house was a short commute to the office and located in a great neighborhood.  this place was great, we went with a big group of friends and it was set up nicely to accommodate all of us.  it has a nice patio outside and a great kitchen for entertaining.  we found that we hung out in the kitchen and dining room the most because it was a place where we could all be at the same time and it was really inviting.  the bedroom off the kitchen is beautiful and has a really comfy bed but you can hear everything that is going on in the kitchen fyi.  don\\'t plan to sleep in if you have friends making coffee at the early hours of the morning.  other than that, we loved this place, great neighborhood, great hosts, lots of space.  loved it!everything is perfectgreat home! had an amazing time here with my family. great kitchen to cook in as well, and beautiful back porch.very accommodating hosts, and amazing neighborhood!  and a beautiful home to top it off.\\r\\ngood contact and good hostsalexandra was very responsive to our inquiries and accommodated our  last minute change of plans. we had a wonderful time catching up with old friends at the house mostly hung out in the kitchen and dining area.  the kids loved playing in the play room and shared the queen the size bed in the basement. street parking was easier than we thought.no surprises here, it truely is a lovely house with a \"wow\" factor! it has everything you need for family, children and friends. although the street is very busy, parking is always available. with very little communication, olivier & alexandra where very accommodating and made us feel at home. this house made for a wedding weekend to remember!alexandra and oliver were wonderful hosts!  their home is beautiful--that you can see from the photos--but thoughtful details like a drawer full of clean fluffy towels, a box of teas and coffees, and a huge backyard patio made our stay even more comfortable.  the neighborhood was delightful.  we could walk to coffee shops and wine bars and it was pretty easy to get around to other areas. we really enjoyed our stay in this unique home. great neighborhood - quiet but walking distance to a lot of nice restaurants and bars. olivier and alexandra are very gracious and attentive hosts and we would return!awesome house, loved the decorations, chocolates on the bed were a nice touch, great communication; would definitely love to stay again. perfect place for our family reunion in sf.  it\\'s even better than pictured.  the large dining table is such a great hang out spot.  kitchen is a true joy for a chef.  the hosts were incredibly helpful and even kindly left a birthday card and cake for my husband who was celebrating one of those milestone b-days.  we\\'d love to come back here for our next family get together. olivier and alexandra were fantastic hosts and their house is optimal for any trip to san francisco.  we were visiting sf with 5 adults and 3 children and were very comfortable staying in their beautiful, clean & well-equipped house.  the house was exactly as it is described in the listing.  the location is perfect for sightseeing in and around sf.  olivier met us there for check-in and made certain that we understood everything about the house and were comfortable with the accommodations.  i would gladly stay here again in the future.alexandra and olivier were great hosts!  they were welcoming and very responsive to our requests/questions.  their home is as lovely as the pictures show.  we enjoyed our stay very much!this house is beautiful and gorgeously decorated. it is clear olivier and alexandra take great care of it. olivier welcomed us warmly and showed us around. the location was really great with gorgeous restaurants and coffee shops close by! i would highly recommend, we had a lovely stay here :)everything was great! staying in this amazing place is true sf experience.  neighborhood is quite and nice. 15 minutes to downtown by car. will definitely recommend this place! what a lovely home.  our family of four (including two kids aged 8 and 3) stayed for five days.  for part of that time, we were joined by my wife\\'s sister and our two nephews (ages 9 and 11), and for one night, my mother in law joined as well.  the house was perfect for our large family.  there was room for everyone to socialize and spend time, but also have private time.  (the kids loved watching movies downstairs while the grownups hung out in the living room upstairs.)  one night, we cooked dinner for a slightly larger family group; the kitchen is perfect for hosting a dinner party.\\r\\n\\r\\none word to prospective renters with kids: when we first saw the listing, we were concerned about staying in this house with our three-year-old because frankly, it looked too *nice.*  (all the white furniture had us a little scared, as did the curved staircase.)  i\\'m so glad we overcame our trepidation.  the house is well-provisioned for families and not nearly as \"fussy\" as we initially assumed it would be.  the upstairs space is lots of fun for the kids, and the main floor, while just as lovely as the pictures suggest, is easy enough to keep clean that we weren\\'t constantly hovering over the kids to make sure they didn\\'t spill.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!  we\\'d love to rent again.we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in san francisco.\\r\\nthe accomodations provided by alexandra and olivier suited our needs very well.  as a group of 6 adults and 1 toddler, we found the home spacious, well supplied with amenities and we truly appreciated the sense of space and light that the décor provided. it was wonderful to have an outdoor area. our grandson really liked to be able to go out of doors to play  in a safe place.\\r\\nit was lovely to arrive to a chilled bottle of wine and a supply of coffee as well as sundry food items.\\r\\nthe location is close to whole foods so grocery shopping was easy.  also, having a bus stop at the corner was great as we used public transit for most of our stay.  having a child friendly playground just a few blocks away was something else we appreciated.\\r\\nas a group, we were pretty independent, but we appreciated getting texts throughout the week asking if our hosts could assist in any way.\\r\\nshould we ever return to san francisco we would love to stay in the same home again and would certainly recommend it to others.\\r\\nit was nice house and we spent really good time there. thank you!really a great place for stay. we live this place for 4 days and had very good experience. olivier is very nice, and left us a bottle of wine which is good.\\r\\nwe stayed at alexandra and oliviers house for six days in june. we were a group of 6 adults and 4 teenagers. the house was perfect for us, with enough rooms and a great kitchen and outdoor area. for a group of 10 it was a bit little equipment, but it was well organized and practical. the surrounding area was very nice and friendly, and we loved the atmosphere in noe valley. the whole foods marked with in walking distance made it easy to get great groceries. public transportation with bus and muni was very accessible, bus 24 and the tram from castro to down town. alexandra was very friendly and engaged in our stay and wellbeing, and responded immediately at our requests. we loved the stay and the whole experience, and we would love to come back.olivier and alexandra were wonderful hosts and we loved staying in their home! the home is beautifully decorated and perfect for our family vacation. we had my in-laws, sister-in-law and three kids. location wise, it was super convenient next to a park, and all the noe valley 24th street stores and restaurants. as a home to stay it was super comfortable, well stocked (kitchen was great for cooking and staying-in if necessary), pack-in plays (for 2 kids), and even had toys! all-in-all it was perfect and it made for a great visit to sf. both olivier and alexandra were also so easy and pleasant to coordinate with before and during our trip. thank you!i booked olivier and alexandra\\'s place for my family\\'s first visit to san francisco from china. they were a group of 10 people with lots of luggages with them. it\\'s not easy to find a place like olivier and alexandra\\'s which has enough rooms and which is also located near downtown sf. the house is clean, beautifully decorated and well organized. my family had a wonderful time staying there. the hosts were very responsive and helpful before and during my family stay. when my family first arrived the place, alexandra had prepared some cupcakes in the kitchen and chocolates every bed. how sweet and thoughtful that is! all in all, i highly recommend the place for anyone who is looking for a place to stay shortly in san francisco and who wants a great time. \\nthank you very much again, olivier and alexandra! our family of 6 stayed at olivier and alexandra\\'s beautiful home for 4 days in august. the hosts were very kind and understanding to our needs. \\r\\nwe had a wonderful time walking the neighborhood and especially enjoyed the whole foods a couple blocks away!\\r\\neveryone loved the roomy and artfully decorated home. the space was uplifting and joyful. such a pleasure after staying in cramped hotel rooms. \\r\\nwe had everything we needed and all the instructions were easy to follow.\\r\\nhighly recommend this home!!i have to say this house is awsome. the distance is not far away from sf downtown. the 5 rooms + 1 outdoor room are clean and great. we have 3 cars could park in front of garage and by the road. our people are so satisfied with alexandra\\'s house. and alexandra were so nice. she made a video conference to let me know everything. to be shamed, we did not clean up completly when we left due to tight schedule and misunderstanding with cleaning protocal. this is the first time we used airbnb. a big lesson learn it was. i recommend you guys can choose this house and keep clean when you checking out. thanks alexandra again. we had a fabulous time exploring the city from this beautifully decorated large home!! it was a great location and comfortably slept our group of 8. the owners were very easy to communicate with also.incredible hosts, and such a beautiful home! i stayed here with my bridesmaids, and there was champagne and such a sweet card waiting for me upon arrival! cutest backyard with a writer\\'s room in the back. i absolutely adored my stay here :)three of my colleagues and i had the pleasure of staying in this wonderful home in september.  the house was as perfect as described and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable.  we loved its fun layout and inspiring decor -it felt like we were staying in a boutique hotel.  it was very clean, bright, comfortable yet spacious with a open equipped kitchen and dining area perfect for a group meal, uniquely decorated bedrooms for each of us and plenty of space to hangout together -we especially enjoyed the back patio basking in the sun.  located only a few blocks away from the best part of town, a quick drive to the freeway with plenty space for parking, the location couldn\\'t have been better.  i  definitely recommend this house.\\nolivier and alexandra\\'s noe valley home is gorgeous and  extremely comfortable. my colleagues and i stayed there for two nights while for a business trip. we were welcomed so warmly by olivier, who gave us a tour of the property and encouraged us to make full use of the home - everything from the coffee and food stuffs to the laundry facilities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts thought of everything you could possibly need to make your stay comfortable. it is perfect for business travelers, large families and girls/guys weekend in sf. a lovely house and great hosts. you will love staying at this property. olivier & alexandra are such a great hosts. while traveling on business, we booked alexandra\\'s home as it was of ample size to accommodate myself and 4 other co-workers. we had the pleasure of meeting alexandra and she was kind enough to spend an hour with us chatting about the bay area and our work.  we had a great stay overall, but i wish i had more time to enjoy the place.  maybe next time! olivier and alexandra were wonderful hosts and the house was just as beautiful in person as illustrated in the pictures provided. they promptly answered all my questions and made sure that i felt comfortable during my stay. i would definitely stay there again. thank you so much for the use of your beautiful home. everything was just like pictures. home was clean, quiet and functional for our use. we look forward to booking here for our next eventolivier and alexandera were very hospitable. we rented the place for an office off site and it was perfect for us to discuss our year and our goals going forward. would highly recommend.the perfect home to spend the holidays in!  our hosts were excellent and even went so far as to put up a few festive decorations and a tree.  we loved the neighborhood and felt right at home. alexandra and olivier were great hosts. very responsive and even helped me find some good restaurants nearby. i rented the entire house for several of my companies leaders to stay in during a business conference in sf, but i would definitely rent this home again for a personal vacation. the home was very clean, in a great location, and was just as expected based on the pictures and description.  this is a great house in a nice part of san francisco.  it\\'s fairly central to a lot of things and there a several places within walking distance (if you don\\'t mind the famous sf hills. :)  the host was easy to get in touch with and the home is just like the pictures.  this would be a great play for 2-3 couples/families to share while in the city.  one thing that was mentioned by people staying there with me is that it would have been nice for the one tv to be in a main living area rather than in the first floor bedroom (the master).  excellent communication and beautiful place. really unique and spacious. would love to return. i brought my 8 person dance company to stay at this beautiful house while we were on tour from nyc. the house was perfect for us, we all had plenty of space, the kitchen was well stocked and made cooking our own meals as easy as if we were at home. the laundry was also really great since we were staying for 10 days. alexandra was very communicative by text and we were able to contact her whenever we had questions. if i am back in sf with a big group id love to stay here again!killer house! great location. will def stay again. \\n\\nsuper easy, which is important to me as i use airbnb for work (and have enough stress already!) wonderful house, cute decorations and a clean atmosphere, however there were fairly tedious cleaning responsibilities, which you don\\'t see everywhere.i had a great time at this beautiful home! it was beautifully prepared and very easy to check in.the area is quiet and comfortable this place makes quite an impact when you walk in - so spacious and well-designed, every inch thought through, and with a definite personality. it was truly a lovely and comfortable place to spend a few days.  my boys had a blast with the toys in the big and well-set-up kid-friendly top floor space - and it was nice having a big bed on that same floor for a grownup to sleep in (in case the kids needed help getting down the stairs to the bathroom during the night or anything else).  we were an extended family staying in the space, and it was perfect for that - we felt like we had plenty of space when we needed it but could still hear where everyone was, and spent a lot of time together in the kitchen/dining room area.  the outdoor space and little cottage outside were so sweet and such a treat for us to have access to.   thank you for having a high chair available, and for having gates on the stairs set up. the kids loved staying there, and so did the grownups.  the area was great, and a short walk to great coffee, breakfast, and whole foods.  check in was simple, and communication was quick and convenient.  thank you for a lovely stay!my family and i have just spent a week at this lovely house.  it was perfect for us - it\\'s light and spacious and has a great kitchen dining area which is just right for a family gathering.  there is a nice outside space with bbq which is a bonus.  noe valley is a great location and we were able to access all areas of the city on foot, public transport or by uber.  communication with alexandra was very easy and we would love to stay again.we had a wonderful stay at this home.  the host was outstanding, the location fabulous, and the home beautiful.  i would highly recommend it.the host canceled this reservation 174 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.katie was very sweet and greeted us with open arms even though we were very late. felt welcome and enjoyed the space very much. the place is great, brand new and just remodelled. it is right across the street from a safeway and parking was very easy.\\r\\ni highly recommend anybody to stay here!our stay here was fantastic.  the apartment just went through a renovation in july and we were among its first guests.  i is very nicely upgraded with very fine appointments.  it\\'s 3 beds + 2 baths + a pretty spacious open living space which was very nice for our party of 5, including 3 kids. \\r\\n\\r\\nwhile it is very nice and well laid out, because it was so newly renovated that it was missing some minor details like face plates for the electrical outlets, closet doors and some curtains.  these missing touches were not an issue for us in the least as everything else was very nice.  the bathrooms haven\\'t been updated yet but they are typical for places of this age so i\\'d rate that as neutral.  but all-in-all, the apartment is very nice especially for places of this age within the city.  \\r\\n\\r\\nas far as location, it is not city central but is within 10-25 minutes to everywhere you\\'d want to get to either by car or public transportation.  it is about a 8-10 minute walk to the subway stations and there is ample parking in the area - unlike most of the rest of the city.  it is across the street from safeway which works well given the lovely kitchen.  also, there are several restaurants within walking distance - we ate at a great dumpling place less than a block away twice.  after spending much time sight seeing we were usually pooped and eating in or at local places was more convenient with our youngins.  \\r\\n\\r\\nperhaps the best part of the apartment is the hostess katie.  she\\'s the most responsive person we\\'ve dealt with on airbnb and was very accommodating on our late arrival into sf in order to give us the keys and to show us around.  she was very sweet to our kids and offered great advice on things to do and places to eat.  she was also quick to answer questions while we were there and to address any issues - like when one of my kids clogged her toilet.  it was taken care of promptly while we were out.  she really was an absolute pleasure to deal with.  \\r\\n\\r\\nso in summary, the apartment was fantastic.  while it\\'s not in the heart of the city it\\'s easy to get to wherever you want to go and was a great value.  we wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay here again and probably will if it\\'s available.  thanks katie.  thank you katie! you were a great host and definitely made us feel welcome! i hope we didn\\'t bother you too much with questions, etc. everyplace you recommended was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  safety was a concern of ours and we definitely felt safe in your home and the neighborhood.  your home is great as it is but the plans you have with it for the future sound very exciting.  we\\'d love to see it when it\\'s done!  we wish you the best of luck in the future! :)this was a great flat to stay in - spacious  and comfortable for a family with 3 teenage children. katie was incredibly helpful and responded to our queries immediately. having safeway right opposite and parking was great. it takes quite a while to get downtown but public transport is good and the neighbourhood is safe and friendly. i would recommend this apartment to anyone, especially families who need more space. katie was easy to communicate with and provided us tons of information regarding our stay. her place beautiful and is located in a great area that made everything very accessible. any nightlife or site seeing that we did not feel like driving to was only a cheap uber ride away. this was my first experience with airbnb and katie set the bar high for other hosts.the apartment was exactly what we were looking for, and katie was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating!katie has a charming personality and responsive at anytime. definitely i recommend her place   great apartment. the renovation looks great and katie was very accommodating. katie was a great host and the apartment was perfect for our needs.great apartment, perfect for our needs!\\r\\nthanks katie! :) my in-laws were actually the guests, and for just one night, but they said the place was lovely and perfectly met their needs.  they never met katie, but appreciated the ability to self check-in, since they had kids and timing was unpredictable.\\r\\n\\r\\ni chatted with katie over text and phone, and she was really friendly and concerned with making sure it worked out for our family.  thanks, katie!neighborhood was great, good food around. katie was very welcoming. cleanliness was an issue, it looks like other guest had left and it was poorly cleaned, we could see dust all over. \\r\\nit got cold in the night and there as no heat. my parents who were in 80\\'s had difficult time coping without heat. temp dropped to 58 on one of the nights.\\r\\n actually i was surprised to see no heat in the condo.\\r\\ngreat collection of books, my father loved and actually took a note to buy some of those.\\r\\nvery spacious for sfo. she did give up her parking spot for us, which was great. \\r\\nno cable tv, which was another surprise to us, u have sign onto netflix / hulu to watch ur program\\r\\n\\r\\na group of four of us stayed at katie\\'s home for 5 days. katie was quick in responding to messages and was on location to meet two of the house mates who arrived before me. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was a perfect fit for our needs to be close to the city college for classes, across the street from a grocery store for great help in keeping healthy eating possible and convenient, and down the street from many local restaurants and even a food truck. the atmosphere in the home made it very easy to feel relaxed at at home- unlink staying in a hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe beds were super comfie as were the couch and large oversized chair. the kitchen was super to eat and cook in and the windows overlooking the street were perfect for daylight and wonderful breezes.\\r\\n\\r\\neveryone in our group truly enjoyed our stay. i was thanked many times for having found this perfect \\'gem\\' which made our trip stress free. i would highly recommend katie\\'s place, and i would use airb&b again for future travel.great place tobstay. spacious with a very clear living room modern and fully equiped kitchen. 3 nice rooms and 2 bathrooms. ideally located. katie is so friendly and available. would come back next timekatie was awesome! the apartment is beautiful and everything was in perfect order when we arrived. katie was there to greet us, show us around, and was available 24/7 if needed. on top of the awesome apartment, the location is great as it\\'s walking distance to grocery stores, shops, restaurants, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend this place! she was out entire time when we stayed at her condo, but whenever we made a phone call, or messaged her, she always replied me back soon. that was so nice of her. the condo was beautiful, and katie is so nice, and so helpful. the place is right on the big street, and there is a safeway across the road, so i loved it. the room was sooo clean beautiful, and awesome. thank you so much for everything, katie. katie\\'s apartment was great for our stay. there was an easy check in/out process, and she was great in communicating everything i needed to know to make my stay enjoyable. her apartment is very cute and in a great neighborhood-right across from a grocery store. my friends and i had a wonderful time at katie\\'s! such a great experience staying at katie\\'s place. the location is easy to get to and a wonderful area to quickly access other nearby neighborhoods. the place is a large and definitely as described. katie was very accommodating and answered all our questions. i would come back and stay here again.heigo was a great host, i really feel that i was going back home everyday. he was always welcoming and help me with everything i need. the place is amazing, great location with easy transportation access and few minutes away from union square. the place was more than i expected to be and i strongly recommend heigo\\'s places if you wanna have fun and meet nice people. heigo was a great host, i called him when i arrived and he immediately showed up to let me in. the place was really clean and as advertised. my only complaint was that while you need a key to get access to the building and the elevator, the actual door to the apartment could not be locked from the outside.heigo is great hosts, hope next time can also live there ...heigo was a fascinating and hospitable host.  this was my first trip to san francisco consisting of any time in the city, and this property was a great location to rent at a reasonable rate, but be within a quick walk to financial district, nob hill, chinatown, little italy, and the moscone center where my conference was.  great first experience with airbnb.heigo was a really nice host, always available and quick to answer.\\r\\nthe room is almost new and very well furnished, and i\\'m not even talking about the great view in the living room.heigo was an excellent host, he came to meet me the first day and showed me around.  the building/unit is beautiful, has full amenities, and is very clean.  i will definitely come back one day.everything perfect.the apartment was really nice and clean.  the building is not in a bad area, but if you go out walking you may run into homeless people since  market st is full of them. the bedsheets smelled nice and it had a very nice kitchen where i was able to cook during my 11 day stay. the gym helped me keep my routine and next to the gym you can find a nice hangout area where you can find a couple of cubicles if you are working from sf. the chairs at the apartment are a little uncomfortable if you are going to be sitting for long periods of time (unless you sit on the couch). heigo was a great host, house was clean and the view was awesome. as curiosity the house is a 2 minutes from (sensitive contents hidden) headquarters.the apartment was very nice and clean. the location was very convenient, one block from the nearest bart station which made getting around town very easy. would definitely stay here again if i were looking for an affordable location in san francisco.the apartment is really nice and modern. i stayed there with a friend and we were happy to meet other people that were staying at the same place. the concept is more like a modern and luxurious hostel. i was greatly surprised with the gym and the common areas. i really loved the building. i noticed that someone cleaned the apartment every other day and checked that we had the things we needed. it is very close to market street and i love the city views from the living room windows. the host provided clean towels, free coffee and coffee maker and we had all the utensils to fix any meal. also, there is a washer/dryer unit inside the apartment. you can also regulate the heater in the rooms and living room independently. \\r\\n\\r\\n on the other hand, we saw several homeless people very close to the entrance of the building. but i noticed that homeless people are everywhere in downtown san francisco and it seemed like they were part of the culture over there. also, the place did not have a tv. another thing, the main door remained unlocked all the time and we did not have personal lockers for our things. \\r\\n\\r\\ngatz let us park our car in his only spot in the garage for $20 a day. i\\'m not sure if that is expensive or not, but i was a little worried about parking it on the street in that area for days (this is an area in transition).\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, if i need to come back to san francisco, i would definitely book this place again. i really liked the concept and loved the building. my friend also had very good comments about this place. thanks gatz!the house was very new. i had no problem checking in or out and the location was perfect for what i needed. i would deffenitely recommend.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat place. accurate description. great host. thanks gratz!very welcoming host. amazing view, very clean and tidy. would highly recommend the host, and the location.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s really a nice house, host told me that the building was built just a year ago! everything is brand new!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is clean! with awesome nice furnitures. it\\'s really a nice and pleasant experience staying here. stayed for over 3 months and had a wonderful time, it really felt like home. gatz was fantastic, super friendly and always helpful. sharing a room was my main concern, but everyone in the apartment was friendly, tidy and always considerate. i\\'ve stayed in hotels in sf which have been appalling, not worth what i paid. definitely recommend staying at one of gatz\\'s properties.brand new building, incredible apartment. spacious, clean, comfortable. very nice views. well equipped. my roommates at the time were wmazing as well. excellent experience. gatz had very clear rules, everything in order, perfect conditions.brooke is amazing. one of our team members had a late flight and we needed a place to store his bags - she not only let him do so but she let him have access to the apartment. the place was beautiful, location was great; close to several grocery stores and lots of restaurants. from the guys that stayed there themselves: our host was fantastic. the front door lock broke on the second day so our keys wouldn\\'t work, and she came by on short notice, got us back inside, and got it fixed right away. then she left us a bottle of wine as an apology for the inconvenience! i really enjoyed staying at this one, would highly recommend. this is a lovely waterfront home in the marina. gracious, comfortable, ideally located, with virtually direct access to crissy field and the beach. views from all front rooms are spectacular and an ideal place to watch the water, the fog, the sunrise and the people. there is a charming rooftop deck. the house and kitchen are well stocked. \\r\\nmargie is an exceptionally thoughtful and generous host and went out of her way to make sure we were happy. our family of four enjoyed everything about our stay and will certainly hope to be able to stay here again. margie\\'s house is fantastic. great location (facing directly to the sea), clean and well decorated. margie is also very kind and responsive. this is our first airbnb experience and we have enjoyed our stay. nikhil is a great host and we enjoyed staying at his room during our trip to san francisco. other roommates were super welcoming and friendly, the very first day they showed us the city and took us for a dinner, and always invited us to join them whenever they were doing something fun. the apartment was nice and spacious and is located in a very alive neighborhood. it was our very first experience with airbnb and we totally loved it! we felt like we were home! thank you!pleasant, very very clean. all the amenities were provided for. the upstairs was a little noisy at night, but nothing that would disrupt you if you were already sleeping.pema\\'s private garden apartment in the mission district was perfect for our family of four (2 adults, 2 teens). there\\'s a separate, spacious bedroom with a queen bed and a large sofabed in the living room that my teens shared. pema provides ample bedding. the kitchen is fully-stocked and was more than adequate for our needs. the washing machine and dryer were welcome amenities. the apartment feels very secure, is clean and well-maintained, and appears to have been fairly recently updated (clean, bright paintwork, nice hardwood floors, elegant tiled bathroom). the private courtyard is a nice touch.\\r\\nthe location is unbeatable, at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, a block from the bart station, and right in between hipster valencia st. and grittier mission st. very walkable and central - just a couple of blocks from clarion alley, celebrated for its graffiti (an authentic, mission-wide artform), and three blocks from world-famous tartine bakery. do yourself a favor and endure the wait in line for their amazing sandwiches and pastries. actual loaves go on sale at 4:30 pm each day. best bread ever!\\r\\nfrom the apartment, we also walked 3 miles north to fisherman\\'s wharf and 2 miles ne to downtown sf. again, it\\'s just a great location. pema is an excellent host and communication with her was easy, despite her being out of town at the time. highly recommended.as a first time airbnb user, i was impressed with pema attention to her property\\'s cleanliness and well prepared. the property was located in a convenient and working class neighborhood. a lot of good eateries are nearby. my family of 4 really enjoyed staying at this property.had a great experience!  the apartment is super conveniently located and amazingly quiet for being in the middle of the mission district.  it was spotlessly clean.  the washer and dryer were so convenient and the kitchen was well equipped.  we met phyllis twice and had nice chats each time.  i\\'ll definitely stay here again next time i\\'m in town.apartment is centrally located in the mission district of san francisco to do a lot of activities. very clean and enough room for me and my two kids. parking can be a challenge (but we arrived at a busy time - 9pm weekend night). p is a great host and communicates quickly.convenient location in the mission, close to the bart and easily accessible. really great amenities, perfect for the traveler who packs lightly - plenty of soaps, shampoo + conditioner, extra toothpaste (i forgot mine!) iron, ironing board, plenty of spare towels, coffee and tea, and very clean. everything needed for a comfortable and convenient stay in san francisco. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe one downfall is the noise from the upstairs unit. the building is not sound insulated very well. i am from nyc so am used to noisy neighbors, but i couldn\\'t sleep past 7am without ear plugs. not an issue that the host can prevent, so i get it! just be prepared with ear plugs!\\r\\n\\r\\nbesides that, it\\'s a great place and i had a nice stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\ni am extremely grateful to my host. phyllis helped me book on a weekend that meant a lot to me. it was a very natural flowing conversation from our first and varied ways of communicating.  her place is a little oasis in the heart of the mission. \\r\\nif you need anything at all or are hoping to cook a little, just reach out and ask her for some help or support, she will work to meet you. i will absolutely re-book when i am in need here in the city. what a great place in an uber-convenient location! pema was extremely accommodating for our arrival. the place was very comfortable for the four of us - extremely comfortable beds! i would definitely recommend anyone who is coming to sf to enjoy the neighborhoods to rent this place.pema is very nice although i didn\\'t meet her in person, we talked a lot through text and email. she had the place ready for us, very tidy and the bed was comfortable. this place is about 2 minute walk to bart. the only downside for me was we could hear the neighbour\\'s (upper leverl) heavy footsteps at night. having a baby that was the only downside. other than that all was well, her place has all the necessities we needed. pema\\'s garden apartment was a great place to stay for the 3 nights we were there! checking in and communicating was also very easy. the listing is just as described, and accomodated 3 people with the help of an extra air mattress. the location can\\'t be beat—right in the middle of the mission and half a block away from bart. tons of great food, shops, and nightlife: perfect for what my coworkers and i needed for the weekend. the apartment is small, but has everything it needs, most importantly it is located in a good part of mission street, walking distance to bars and restaurants. as others wrote in their reciews, you can definitely hear the people upstairs because the soundproofing is not good, but then again this is the case in most places in the states. pema was very helpful with all we needed. very nice and easy. great location! the patio is nothing special but was nice to have when children was a sleap at night. would higly recommand.pema was wonderful with communication and working with our difficult flight times by allowing us to check in early and store our bags, made all the difference. the place is located on a quiet alley but steps away from most things in the mission while still being tucked away. great location in mission! very easy to find. 16th street bart station is really close.kelly\\'s place was absolutely amazing! could not have asked for a more beautiful place to stay in sf. we made s\\'mores on the rooftop at night and woke up with a run through the presidio and up the lyon steps (which are literally feet from the house). the palace of fine arts is also just a short walk down the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe made the reservation at the last minute and kelly graciously accommodated us. can\\'t wait to stay again in the future :)my fiancé jennifer and i had a wonderful stay in this centrally located loft in downtown san francisco. this place has one of the best views of downtown and is within walking distance to many popular reaturants. kerstin was a kind and gracious host, i can\\'t say enough kind words on how hospitable she was. make sure to check out her restaurant picks around the area. thanks kerstin!zak was great. clean apartment. convenient to get to the muni and be in the city in 30 mins. was a good location between city and sfo! had a good time, turtle chased my finger. neighborhood\\'s not as bad as every cab driver on earth will describe. place was really clean, and the guy was nice. our goal was to find a place close to the airport, and everything was as described and shown. it was a short trip, so i cannot comment to the neighborhood or accessibility to bart. all in all, a good place for the price. great host, great place, would recommend it to anyone! could not have asked for a better stay, would definitely like to come back. next time i need a place to stay in sf, this will be my pick!absolutely. zak was completely courteous and made sure we had everything we neededmy friend and me stayed at zak\\'s apartment for 8 months and we loved it. zak was a great host and did everything to make our stay comfortable and pleasant.\\r\\ni can only recommend this place! perfect stay!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nalessandra was very much help-full even before arriving. we got a very warm welcome and everything was organized in a perfect way.\\r\\nthe flat has got lots of space and is newly renovated. \\r\\ninternet access with very good band-with. soundboard to play your music. very good equipped kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is perfect, very nice neighborhood walking distance to goldengate park and chestnut street, where you will find a lot of fancy bars and good restaurants.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe were there for a conference and appreciated much more than a hotel. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall a very nice flat in one of the best areas of san francisco with the best hosts you can emmagine.wonderful flat and great host!\\r\\n\\r\\nmy husband and i stayed here with our two teenage children during a recent vacation to san francisco.\\r\\nwe had a great time and would definitely stay here again.  we felt like we were staying in a real home.  the flat was very clean, spacious, full of great amenities, and well located.  the flat had everything we needed...comfortable beds, nice linens, and a fully equipped kitchen.  it was nicely decorated and had a peaceful vibe.\\r\\neverything was very clean and organized.\\r\\n    \\r\\nthe apt is right off of  chestnut st, where you will find great restaurants, retail, walgreen\\'s and a place for groceries. \\r\\nthe neighborhood is very safe, quiet, and peaceful.\\r\\n\\r\\nalessandra was a great, accommodating host.\\r\\nshe made our check-in very easy even though she was not in town when we arrived.  any questions we had were promptly responded to by texting.  she was also very accommodating.   we were able to check-in early and  leave our bags on the last day of our trip after check-out, so we could enjoy the day before heading to the airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy family and i all agree that we would stay here again on our next trip to\\r\\nsan francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis was our first time to use airbnd and the whole experience has been effortless. we will use this again and recommend to our friends.\\r\\nalessandra was a great host and she has a beautiful home. everything was perfect, and she was very responsive to questions. looking forward to staying again!my family consisting of two grandchildren, daughter and son-in-law had a fantastic time in the apartment. the apartment was extremely comfortable and upscale. the location was in chestnut? close to palace of fine arts and the presidio. alessandra was extremely responsive to our few and minor questions. we would definitely come back here.alessandra was a great communicator and very helpful.  the apartment is one of the best i\\'ve ever rented, beautifully decorated and well equipped.  i especially loved that the bedrooms were in the back of the house, preventing street noise.  great place and great location! the bus 30 will take you almost everywhere you want to go. lots of places to eat nearby. alessandra was great at communicating promptly.great location 1 block to bakery and restaurants but not noisy at night.\\r\\ngreat kitchen and living room makes you feel at home.\\r\\nparking good.alessandra was great in ensuring we were all set for our week trip to san francisco. my girlfriend and i had a wonderful time at the apartment and it was exactly as advertised. the neighborhood had plenty to do and everything we needed was within a block away. highly recommend staying here! the listing was very accurate.  this place is in the best neighborhood in the city.  the hosts were more than welcoming.  the apartment had clean towels and dishes for our use.  the windows that overlook broderick were nice to keep open and let the cool sf air enter in the the morning and evenings.  very convenient to walk to the marina and presidio.  chesnut has some of the best shops and restaurants only blocks away.  thanks again alessandra.  would love to stay with you guys again. had a great stay at this place. was in town for work and this was a great quiet and relaxed place to return to at night after work. v comfy beds and tastefully decorated. will defo use again if i can next time i am here. a fantastic space in a great neighborhood; the photos and description in this listing very accurately represent the feeling of the space in-person. plenty of room inside to spread out and work (or relax); but also walking distance to great food, views, and fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nalessandra was very timely in responding to questions (of which i had very few).  couldn\\'t be happier with our stay!we had a wonderful stay at alessandra\\'s apartment. it is located in a great neighborhood, close to a wide variety of restaurants and shops. the apartment is comfortable and clean and filled with anything you may need during your stay. the apartment and street are very quiet. i definitely recommend staying here!the apartment was in a wonderful neighborhood, close to restaurants and shops. we enjoyed walking to the palace of fine arts and the golden gate bridge. the house was spacious and fully equipped. the house is 2 spacious bedrooms and 1 bathroom. i would definitely stay here again. alessandra was incredibly responsive before and during our stay. she made it easy to enjoy the experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is in a wonderful location. wonderful flat in one of the best neighborhoods of sf. will definitely go back. we enjoyed the location and spaciousness but i was disappointed in the level of cleanliness. i recommend a new cleaner is brought in and that carpets be shampooed. the bathtub drain wasn\\'t draining which i found pretty disgusting and we ended up having to fix it ourselves. if cleaned up apartment could be very pleasant. the place is described exactly as is.  alessandra was super nice and made us feel very welcomed.  she was also super accommodating.  alessandra was great!  arriving to the apartment was seamless and easy.  the apartment is just as the pictures show; fabulous.  if you are looking for a great location in the marina look no further.  alessandra is so helpful and fast to respond! the apartment is lovely, clean, well decorated and quiet.  our employees stated there during a training week and had a great time, slept well and it was very convenient to our office in the presidio!  alessandra was easy to communicate with and very responsive to questions.  we met her husband steve as well and they were both wonderful.  the flat was extremely well located in the marina and was super clean and artistically decorated.  she had all the amenities we could have asked for and a well stocked kitchen.  we would love to stay here again!alessandra was welcoming and professional. the flat more than met our expectations while on a work trip to san francisco. per usual, alessandra was extremely helpful in making another trip to sf flawless. thanks for making it a great trip!i truly enjoyed staying here. it was close to everything and big enough to comfortably sleep my friends and i. \\nthis was my first time using airbnb and because this experience i will continue to do so. the host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.i get quick respond and help and andra, thank you andra. i like this home.alessandra was a fantastic host - and their apartment is beautiful - couldn\\'t have been any better! \\r\\nthis is a beautiful apartment in the perfect location if you want to stay in the marina district. it is 1/2 block from chestnut with all of its shops and restaurants and a couple blocks from the presidio, the shore and gorgeous views of the gg bridge. there is a locked entry gate and so you feel really safe and secure in this nice neighborhood. the apt. was immaculate, and the decor and amenities are as described. the beds were comfortable, great internet and tv and it was terrific to be able to do laundry with the nice machine - all soap and stuff provided. alessandra welcomed us with drinks and other treats and we instantly felt right at home!\\r\\n\\r\\nalessandra was extremely easy to work and communicate with and very responsive to all of our questions and concerns. when we arrived her son was staying in their other flat upstairs. he gave us a second set of keys and told us where to park (blocking their driveway - thank you as parking is pretty tight in the neighborhood!)   also, when we blew up the air mattress it had a hole in it so my son ended up halfway to the floor the next morning. alessandra quickly solved that problem by bringing down a very nice twin mattress the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\na couple things to note: the toilet is in its own little room, and i mean little - just enough room for the toilet and a sink but this actually worked out okay for the 6 of us staying in the apartment. unfortunately, the window is a bit jammed - it would be nice if it could open fully.  it\\'s very quiet but of course, as with all city apt. living, we could hear folks walking above us although it didn\\'t bother us. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe only suggestions i have are small.  it would be very nice to have a microwave. travelers often have leftovers or want to quickly heat something. there is lots of counter space in the kitchen for one. also, a good knife block with bread knife, etc. would be very nice as would a nice set of pots and pans, cooking utensils and kitchen towels. we found what we needed but the kitchen is so beautiful, it deserves the amenities to match! finally, the lighting is good in the kitchen but even with the windows open in the living room, it sometimes felt a bit dark. the bedrooms could also use better lighting or brighter bulbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe highly recommend the pizza place on lombard right next to the presidio!\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this is a fantastic place to stay. location, location, location! \\r\\nalessandra was a very accommodating host and made things extremely easy and comfortable for me and my guests!exceptional place! couldn\\'t have had a better stay. beautiful room, very comfortable bed. the bathroom is spotless and new. robes, slippers, and breakfast were included. the hosts were super helpful in showing us the best restaurants nearby. awesome location, next to the famous painted ladies, walkable to the mission, close to good coffee at the mill. fast wifi too! really great.this is much more than a private room -- this is a private wing of a large, majestic victorian steps away from alamo square park and playground. the bed is extraordinarily plush and comfortable, and it was a delight waking up to views overlooking san francisco.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe location was perfect for our toddler, and close to everything. we loved walking to all the wonderful nearby hayes valley coffee shops and restaurants. the hosts are respectful and great with children and their full-time assistant accommodated our unique needs amazingly well. more than five stars!\\r\\nthe neighborhood is well located.  it was easy to get around.  not easy to park, but plenty of uber, taxi, etc. available.  i love the room.  super comfy bed, comfy bathroom.  the room is at the end of a hall - very private and quiet.  lots of light and also great blackout drapes for a good sleep.  the family is lovely.  i have food allergies and the hosts easily accommodated me for breakfast.  i would absolutely stay again!  thank you!family-friendly is an understatement for this beautiful victorian. the house is full of art, and the hosts and their assistant really made our family of four feel welcome. the guest suite has a huge comfortable bed and en-suite bathroom is just amazing. toys and story books were waiting in the room for our two children, and our five-year-old was provided a scooter (with helmet) for getting around the neighborhood. we visited the exploratorium for free as the hosts are members there. the family assistant helped book our next night\\'s accommodation in big sur, and shipped a left item promptly to our next address in los angeles. there are great playgrounds and restaurants (ask jyri recommendations for very delicious ice cream or sushi!) close by, and also many small boutiques. highly recommended as a home base for any kind of san francisco adventure!what a beautiful and magical experience, thanks to the wonderful langtry... and our warm and extremely accommodating and helpful hosts.  vanessa and i would highly recommend the langtry to anyone! catarine and jyri made the visit perfect. they were both welcoming and generous and had amazing recommendations for what to do, eat, and see in the (great) neighborhood and community. their recommendation of taking a detour tour really brought our visit to the next level! \\r\\n\\r\\ntheir home looks even better than the pictures depict. it\\'s a beautifully appointed, comfortable and inspiring setting to relax in... read in... and just be in.   the front room of the house, which you pass through to get to the langtry, is one of the most creatively appointed you\\'ll ever see.  the skateboards alone are works of art.  you\\'ll see!\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you so much for everything. we would definitely stay again! highly recommended! we were in town for a conference and stayed in the two rooms at the langtry. it is centrally located, and easy to go in and out during the day. great location next to the alamo square\\'s \"painted ladies\". great photo opp! fast internet, and the hosts were very helpful and super friendly with everything. there were lots of restaurants nearby. especially toronado which is the coolest pub in sf and the grind for hearty breakfast. nearby great shopping at haight street. both rooms were even better than expected. fantastic view over san francisco, balcony, fireplace, lounge area, desk etc. really worth the visit!this house is charming,we spent a happy holiday here.we had an absolutely fantastic time at the langtry. the house is beautifully decorated and the rooms were lovely and spacious. private bathroom and tea/coffee facilities were also provided. jyri and caterina were lovely and helpful hosts offering advice on local favourites and things to do with kids. the painted ladies are next door and the local restaurant/cafe/shopping-scene is buzzin\\' - so great location too. can\\'t recommend the langtry enough. great and friendly couple hosting this stunning room (+another smaller one) + really nice bath in their fabulous home. bed was one of the best i have slept in. will definitely go back!the langtry was the perfect place. we stayed there for 3 nights, and it was really unique, and extremely beautiful, just like in the photos. \\r\\n\\r\\ncaterina greeted us when we arrived, and was attentive to any request that we made. the place is perfectly located neat alamo square park, with a beautiful view of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe entire place is simply breathtaking. the only downside was not having a kitchenette, but we knew that when decided to stay here, so we mainly ate outside, a lot of very cool places to eat nearby. all in all, a true victorian san francisco visiti felt lucky that it rained most of the time i was in sf because it gave me a reason to spend some extra time at home drinking tea in the bay window. that\\'s how amazing this place is! while i never met the hosts, their assistant was super accommodating and they were very courteous and welcoming in our communications. their house is so full of personality and life and yet somehow very relaxed and low-key. i felt like bohemian royalty. the suite also feels like it\\'s own apartment (one with its own amazing view). it\\'s conveniently located but also in a quiet residential neighborhood a block from the park. staying here was a magical experience. it was an absolutely great experience to stay in this unique guest room waking up to beautiful views over the city. the room is very spacious and cosy, the bathroom is large and top notch. the place really beats many boutique hotels. the house is located on a quiet residential street, but really close to cafes, parks and eateries and the famous painted ladies. if you\\'re jet-lagged and waking up early, this is pretty awesome location for early morning walks. hosts jyri and caterina were very welcoming and helpful with everything.\\r\\nhighly recommended!jyri, caterina and their daughter were such wonderful, warm hosts to my teenage sons and me on our west coast adventure for spring break this year.  they were so kind to share their absolutely stunning home in the heart of san francisco about a block from the \"painted ladies\".  their hospitality was so warm, as we were made to feel comfortably at home in their extremely sweet place.  their hospitality and home gave us just the perfect taste of the city of san francisco\\'s heart.  i don\\'t know how they could have improved on our experience.  we would love to have another time in the future with these fine folks and the amazing langtry.  god bless this fine family, outstanding people of california!arguably one of the most beautiful places i\\'ve stayed at. the room is exactly as depicted in the photo, full of artworks and decorated with intricate persian carpets as well as edwardian furniture. you could also get a panorama view of city center from the balcony when the weather is good.  absolutely stunning. caterina and jyris beautiful and creative home itself became one of the coolest sightseeing spots during our stay in sf. we tried many of their recommendations and they were all spotless. i would specifically like to recommend the restaurant nopa two blocks away.waking up at the langtry was a wonderful and surreal thing. their eclectic collection of art, sculpture and curios from every corner of the world were an absolute feast for my eyes. nothing belongs together and yet everything works.  the bedroom room with its high ceilings, vast city view and outstanding marble shower were icing on the cake. if you want an insight into the life of artistically curious, innovation oriented international family in a classic  historically restored san francisco home. this is the place for you. \\n\\nthese hosts are pros and make real everything good about the a\\nairbnb sharing economy. \\n\\nthank you for such a memorable night in your whimsical, bo-ho, downright cool haight ashbury home. \\nyou made us a memory. we enjoyed a lovely three night stay at this beautiful victorian home.  \"the langtry\" has been well described by every reviewer before me.  this is an esthetically inspiring, comfortable and relaxing place from which to go out and experience this beautiful city.    \\nfive stars for architecture, originality of decor, accommodations (generous in size), comfort, location, views & literate selection of books (guest room).  check-in & communication was timely & pleasant.  our stay was during a holiday weekend so the house was fairly quiet.  very nice hosts and assistant.  i highly recommend staying here.  it will enhance your experience of san francisco.  vic, rob, and the rest of the hackerhomesf family were so helpful and kind during my stay (and these guys had to put up with a lot — i\\'m pretty sure i got lost and called them at least three different times). hackerhomesf really does feel more like a home than other airbnb places that have more of a hotel or hostel-y vibe. i had the female guest room all to myself, and while it\\'s a loft area, the doors and curtains close completely so that it\\'s quiet even when people are talking in the lounge. vic, rob, and david were excellent hosts who went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable. this hacker home is a fun, diverse, welcoming place. i would stay there again in a heartbeat. vic is a real mensch. not can you tell this by how accommodating he is you can tell by meeting the people that are attracted to the hackerhome. i just moved to san francisco and staying at this airbnb was the smartest thing i\\'ve ever done. i\\'ve received excellent professional advice, was given a lot of recommendations, and met wonderful people. most importantly the house was clean and breakfast foods were always stocked. the home is easily accessible to all parts of the city (there isn\\'t a borough that you can\\'t get to within 20 min) and potrero hill has a wide selection of food/cafes/bars. thank you vic - i highly recommend this place to anybody traveling to san francisco. i had to read each and every single review before making my reservation, sleeping on a bunk bed with a bunch of people is not something i\\'d do lightly. i\\'m a very reserved & private person, but i\\'ve been really happy living at p. hill. i loved hanging out with the people living there and i don\\'t intend to stop even though i\\'ve now found a place of my own. it was hard to leave. vic, rob, and david were extremely accommodating, reasonable, smart, driven, fun hosts. i\\'m typically a quiet person but with this bunch, it was hard to convince them that i was. i especially love how midweek feels like weekend living there. :)great place!\\r\\nnice house and very nice and fun people!!!\\r\\n100% advisablei staid one week and it was nice. \\r\\nthe apartment is clean and most of all, roommates are great. great place to stay as long as you feel at ease with not that much privacy. you get a chance to meet very interesting people, beds are comfortable and the place has everything you need for your stay (fully equipped kitchen, washing machine, clothes dryer, towels,...)\\r\\n\\r\\ndefinitely worth it !thank you to the hackerhouse for making my first airbnb experience better than expected! the house is full of friendly, interesting, hardworking, and respectful people. i was a little hesitant about the idea of bunks and shared sleeping space, but the girls really luck out and get the 3rd floor loft with single beds to themselves. the house was even cleaner than i expected and there were no waits for the shower. i brought ear plugs and a sleeping mask/eyecover, as others recommended, and had no problems sleeping (but you should really bring these two items if you want to go to bed early or are a light sleeper). the location was also perfect for me (an 8 min walk to the mission bay conference center and a 30 min walk to downtown). this is by far the best deal in san francisco and it is at the top of my list for return visits! vic is an awesome host. i enjoyed my stay at the dogpatch hackerhome. the housemates were great to hang out with. then there are delightful surprises like hand-written notes and great parties. i\\'d have no hesitation in recommending this to friends.\\r\\nvic is an amazing host, and the dogpatch house is definitely the best place to stay in you love tech and want to spend a few weeks in the city or just settle in. this house has a great community that enjoys doing stuff together, and you will make some friends for sure! i was new to the city and the host helped me settle in and gave me a lot of useful infos. the hackerhome is a lovely little community. i met people from all over and everyone was respectful, had interesting projects, etc. vic was responsive, the place was clean. all good. overall great value for money in a convenient location where we needed to be.  vic and the others were very helpful and friendly, and we would certainly stay there again in similar circumstances.  we felt safe, secure and welcomed by the other guests.  they do recommend earplugs if you are a light sleeper. i would go slightly further and recommend earplugs if you are not a heavy sleeper, especially if you wish to go to sleep early.  similarly, i would recommend an eye mask if light keeps you awake.  this reflects the reality of sharing a (large) apartment with up to a dozen or so others, each with their own schedules.  everyone was really friendly, and considerate, but life involves a certain amount of light and sound.  also be aware there is no elevator, so you need to be comfortable with stairs.it was really smooth experience to stay at hackerhome dogpatch (or mission bay as in listing). the location is superb, very close to everything and still relaxed neighborhood with walk/bike paths near the bay in a very close distance. the space isn\\'t super huge but the rooms are big and i felt myself very easy, i could do my own work and stuff or connect with people. and all people were very interesting and friendly. everybody came to the place with a different story. it was really nice to meet with everyone..\\r\\n.. i could continue .. but actually just write to vic (btw he is also a super awesome guy with a strong and very friendly personality :) ) and start your own story of hackerhome - mission or any other of his hackerhomes in other areas of bay area - it is really worth it!the hackerhome is a great place for entrepreneurs that are looking for a very good location at a fair price in sf.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts are pretty flexible and ready to help with anything you need. great apartment filled with awesome, interesting people. highly recommend. :)vic was the perfect host. he organized the flat properly. rob, who was organizing the one at dogpatch also did a great job.\\r\\none of the best things about vic: he\\'s fast. ultrafast. i had a question, pinged him and got my answer withing minutes. he\\'s a good host as he cares about the people who are at his place. and by setting up rules and he made pretty clear for whom that place might be good.the hackerhome was a great place to stay for my ~1 week in sf. it\\'s nothing fancy, you get what you pay for. i met some really cool people and would definitely recommend staying there.great host! genuinely cats for his tenants and is a great guy in general. amazing view,  beautiful apartmentlovely hosts, comfy + clean apartment, nice people from all over the world, good location to browse the haight. i met vic once, he\\'s the real deal, cool guy. i can highly recommend to satyr @ haighthome. i had a great time @ haighthome in august, therefore i decided to come back for another week. its a lovely place. vic make your stay very convenient. its always nice to talk to him. chiara and frederico, the hosts, make this place to heaven on earth. i had a wonderful time in the house!!\\r\\nthe house is great with a wonderful view and also very well located. i really loved the neighbourhood.\\r\\nvic, phil were very sweet, kind and very helpful. people in the house were very great and i had a very very great time! i wil come back :)we had a great time staying at the hackerhome! we had full access to the workspace (and free stickers!) and it was exactly what we needed as an up and coming startup visiting san francisco. i encourage any startup folks to come and stay here. beds were clean and comfortable, everyone was nice and friendly. internet is good on the main floor. if you need really good internet just go to the coworking space!the neighborhood is amazing! beautiful houses, coffee places and restaurants nearby, residential feel, buena vista park \"in the back yard\", i would say central location, if i move to san francisco i would love to live in the area. right after i arrived at sfo i texted eric and he responded right away. $30 later (uber, and i used vic\\'s promo code - thank you, vic) i was at the house and eric gave me a detailed tour of the house making me feel very welcome.good room. welcoming housemates. great view! fantastic location.excellent conditions in vic\\'s hacker home. incredibly comfortable and easy to move in and out of.  the wifi, kitchen and living room is exceptional. house manager is a great guy who cares about your stay and is also incredibly accommodating and understanding. excellent spot for sure. highly recommended vic is awesome. the haight house is one of my favorite of all vic\\'s hackerhomes. amazing group of people staying there. i had a really good experience here. really clean and neat house. beds are very comfortable. all the shared areas in the house are very spacious. the room upstairs was very big, that\\'s where i stayed. space is big enough to accommodate everybody (8) comfortably. plus it has a big balcony with the most amazing view. location is great, a block away from the bus stop and mini-market. very safe. very calmed, quiet and relaxed atmosphere. vic was very nice and always a click away. he was very fast responding to any questions i had.   henry was very friendly and accommodating during my stay. the room is quite spacious compared to most things you\\'ll find in san francisco, and the home itself was quite nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe place is on the outskirts of sf, so it\\'s helpful to have a car if you wish to save time. despite the k/t picking up quite near, your quickest route to downtown is arguably the 9 that picks up just beside it. you can also use a car service or taxi, but it could get expensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy only complaint was there\\'s not really anything in the area, and transit times into the city aren\\'t the best. though these are no fault of henry, it\\'s just something to keep in mind when planning your visit. overall, a good experience!we need a place to sleep for 1 week in sf. we call henry and he accept our reservation on airbnb. \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you henry ! you are a very cool host and your house is very pleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis was a very cool week because of you and your house.my girlfriend and i stayed at the private bedroom in henry\\'s home for 3 nights. henry\\'s home is very well-kept and impeccably clean. the place is located a bit outside of the city, but that was okay for us because we had a rental car. if we didn\\'t, we probably would have used public transportation, which is in walking distance of the house. the bathroom was also very clean and the shower worked great. after a long day of adventures in the city and late nights of bar-hopping, it was great to come home to a quiet, clean place where we could lay our heads and have a good night\\'s rest. all in all, henry is a gracious host with a well-kept place.henry was a pleasure to stay with!\\r\\nhis very comfortable, clean home was right off the arleta muni stop so it was very easy to ride into town for only 2 bucks! it didnt take more than 3 minutes to walk down and catch the \"train\". \\r\\nthe view from the apartment was lovely! sunset was the best! we could see a bit of everything... water, mountain, city you name it.\\r\\nhenry was very informative on how to travel the city; where to go... what to do...\\r\\nwe really enjoyed our stay... we will be back!\\r\\nhenry lee was very prompt in replying to my inquiries from the time i first emailed until i left on the last day.  it was very helpful to be in good communication at all times.\\r\\nthe room was very comfortable, clean and aesthetically pleasing.  i felt like the events of the day could be left behind and i had my own private world to renew and rest in.  i loved having my own bathroom and hot water.  \\r\\nhenry\\'s home is also aesthetically pleasing and lovely.  the views are beautiful, the kitchen is wonderful, and the trip to the t line, light rail, was very convenient.\\r\\nhenry was a great host and was there when i arrived.  he was ready to answer questions and had the t line schedule printed out for me.  henry was generous in sharing the kitchen and any information i needed about san francisco.\\r\\ni feel like i would not have been able to do the tremendous amount of stuff i wanted to do with my daughter if i had not had adequate rest and quiet.  henry lee was able to provide that for me in a most unobtrusive way.  the place and facilities were good and the view from up the hill was beautiful. henry was very friendly and helpful. when we asked for a toaster, he immediately went to buy one for us. he asked us for our needs because he wants to meet the requirements of his guests.i stayed with henry for 1 month while i rotated through a hospital nearby. henry was very prompt in his response to my message and he made sure to answer any questions i had prior to my arrival. when i arrived, henry greeted me at the door with his cute schnauzer and made me feel very comfortable and at home.  his place is beautiful. not only is it clean and beautifully decorated, he has a stunning view of the surrounding area.  my room was exactly as it looked on airbnb – again, clean and lovely. upon arrival henry showed me to my room and gave me a tour of his place. he said that we would share the living room space and kitchen. he even gave me one level in the fridge to store my food. he showed me the thermostat and told me to always feel free to adjust it to whatever temperature that would be most comfortable for me, which was great because san francisco can be quite cold. i had brought a car to the city so that i could drive to work. and to my surprise, henry gave up the parking space in front of his house so that i could park there, and he instead parked on the street just to make things more convenient for me. he made sure to give me directions to my work place along with direction toward the nearest freeways and grocery stores, and gave me recommendations on good eateries in the area. when i came home from work, i always had a lot of privacy and really felt comfortable and relaxed at henry’s place. we also had great conversations and would catch up with one another throughout the week. needless to say, henry’s place was really the perfect find for me. i highly recommend it and will definitely stay there again when i head to the city. the room is very comfortable and spacious, the apartment has a wonderful view on the city and henry and allan were both great hosts, really helpful. my boyfriend and i had a very nice couple of days at their place.henry was extremely nice and very helpful during our stay.  he gave us access to the kitchen and living room, and also provided helpful printouts for our travels.  the room and bathroom were very clean and the house was quiet.  henry is a great communicator and very understanding. i would stay there again. maikee was very quick to respond to all inquiries, whether through the airbnb site or via text message. though we never met in person, she came across as very friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house worked out very well for our group of 8. we were the first ones to rent this property, so while we did come across a few minor issues, they were nothing that impacted our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe found numerous restaurants and a decent grocery store within walking distance on chestnut (to the north) and union (to the northeast) streets.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall we were very happy with the location, condition of the house and amenities. we would definitely consider renting this property from maikee again in the future.beautiful place! we would definitely come back!what an outstanding experience. the house is in the most fantastic location and so incredibly well appointed. we never met the host, however, he made certain to have a large box of extra towels delivered before we woke.\\r\\ni almost do not want to write in order to make certain the house is available for us next month.staying at maikee\\'s house was a pleasure.  beautiful house with and a perfect rental spot.  i was visiting family and maikee made sure everything was in order.  he even bought a grill for us to use while we were there!  this house has everything you need!  maikee made sure to check in and ensure we had a great stay.  this is the perfect house in an amazing location for a stay in sf.  i would highly recommend this spot.  i wish i could have stayed all summer.  thank you, maikee!maikee\\'s house is on a convenient location, just few blocks to union and chestnut street, on the mid way from fisherman wharf and union square.. the house has pretty garden in front of the house , so i can\\'t see the house in the first passing by. parking was just opposite of the house on the street but during 8 am-6 pm on weekday, we had to move car every 2 hours when we did not go out. \\r\\nthere\\'re  4 comfy bedrooms but only 2 bathrooms , that was a bit hectic in the morning. \\r\\nin overall, if you spend most of the time out of the house , and enjoy walking (up and down hill) ,  eating out (chestnut street has lot of nice restaurant ie. blackwood) and one big family...  maikee\\'s house is recommended. maikee was so kind, tried to accommodate our needs and checked in regularly.  the house allowed us to enjoy some precious family time in a wonderful part of the city.  we loved our stay?\\r\\nwe enjoyed our stay in this pretty and charming house in pacific heights. it was spacious and comfortable and beautifully decorated. located in a pretty street close to fishermans wharf  and the ferries to alcatraz. although street parking was restricted we managed to get a park every evening. our host was so easy to get along with and even when we lost a house key, graciously offered to drop by with another. we would recommend this lovely home and give it full stars in every way. keen to come back and explore more of san fran. great coffee shop just down the road called the wreaking ball. a favourite for morning coffee. maikee was great reaching out to me asap, as it was a short-notice stay.  she made herself very much available to myself and the other guests, always quick to respond and take care of any needs.  great location. very accommodating. even mailed me a coveted blankie my son left behind. would stay there again!yes. he was very attentive.maikee\\'s place was perfect for our trip! the house was everything we wanted and more! there was plenty of space the the neighborhood was close to everything we might need! he was very attentive and responded to all the questions that we had about the house and the surrounding area. this home was the perfect stay for myself and my team during our visit to san francisco. it was immaculately clean, tidy, and so so comfy! maikee made sure all the essentials were stocked, and was available for us when we had questions. i would recommend maikee and this home to anyone that is truly wishing to stay in the heart of the city, and feel a part of it.home was a beautiful oasis in the hustle and bustle of the city. clean and quiet. very enjoyable stay.great location and great house. everything perfect when we arrived. clean as a whistle and everything we needed to make ourselves at home quickly. thank you!great house, great location, great experience. everything was as smooth as one would hope. great communication before to make all the details required for arriving in the us easy.\\r\\nclear arrangements on arrival regarding access, excellent location just off union street, property worked well for family meeting up, comfortable and spacious.the house was better than it appeared in the pictures.  the place was very clean when we arrived and easy to locate.  we had a great time in the house and would highly recommend the rental to others.our arrival was extremely easy, the neighborhood is beautiful and the surrounding has some awesome restaurants, coffee shops and bakeries. its a really short ride to downtown. the house was perfect- comfortable and plenty of room!this is a gem of a home in a fabulous location.  the neighborhood is gorgeous for walking and you are only a few minutes from union st. where there are tons of coffee shops, boutiques and restaurants.  it\\'s a very nice house. great house. spacious rooms and wonderful locacation. ample supplement. maikee helps a lot with our staying. i will definitely stay here again if come back to sf.very nice house in a fabulous neighborhood. great host and very accommodating!location is perfect and a very nice house. thanks for the stay!large group of 10 adults stayed comfortably in this lovely home in a premier location within san francisco\\'s pacific heights neighborhood. large dining room, open kitchen, and nice bedrooms made the home an easy stay for all. parking was easy to come by and it was an easy walk or uber to anything we wanted to do in the city. maikee was very responsive and made the stay a joy. we simply loved our stay at maikee\\'s place !\\r\\nwe were a french family we stayed 8 days and we felt like home ... the house is nice the little terrace behind the kitchen is a perfect spot for a sunny breakfast .\\r\\nthe beds are huge and so confortable ... \\r\\nthis house is in the best neighbourhood and also very quiete in the middle of the trees \\r\\nwe would love to stay there next time \\r\\nthe house was in a great neighbourhood and it was no problem getting an uber to the convention centre. maikee\\'s place was very clean and beds were comfy. the floors were a little creaky and it was a little inconvenient having one of the washrooms as an ensuite. had we been family members the washroom wouldn\\'t have been a problem but it was a little awkward since we were 4 colleagues sharing the space. overall though, the house was great and worked very well for our purposes. maikee was always quick to respond which made sorting out the accommodations really easy. loved this house!! the neighborhood was fantastic and i wish i had more time to spend there.  we slept 10 in the house and everyone was comfortable.  i would recommend this to anyone,families or groups of friends.  would love to go back!  thank you! the house is as described, set back from the street and near some great restaurants and stores.  the nights were cold due to unseasonably cold weather, and maikee was nice enough to bring by some extra blankets.  very thoughtful.  through and through a lovely experience.perfect stay in pac heights. we organized a trip with three other couples for my wife\\'s 40th birthday.  we went out in the city and did a day trip to napa.  the house was perfect, because it was in a great location, it was big enough for all four couples and it was a great layout for hanging out and reconnecting.  maikee was highly responsive to messages and allowed us to get us into the house early.  the property was beautiful and in a great neighborhood.  i would recommend it to you and stay there again.maikee was wonderful to work with!  he was very responsive and helpful. the house worked very well for our family of 8. location was great with fun shopping and restaurants just around the block. the neighborhood was really great and the house from outside looks charming but maikee needs to do some real maintenance.\\r\\n  the downstairs bathroom could use some work. old bathtub hard to shower without water leaking everywhere. kitchen stove didn\\'t work. smell of gas when we tried to use but didn\\'t heat. only 2 burners worked. \\r\\nmikee was difficult to reach although text messages were sent he rarely responded. \\r\\nalthough i enjoyed the neighborhood restaurants and shops, i wouldn\\'t stay here again. maikee was very accommodating. the instructions were very clear and the description is on point. the location of the property is near the marina district and parking is not a problem. i would definitely recommend his home. :)amazing experience in mike\\'s house! it is a well furniture house and every thing is great to use, the room is clean and neighbours are so nice!! highly recommended!!!mike was the most accommodating host anyone could ask for. i was in a serious bind after airbnb cancelled my reservation the night before i had a group of 8 flying in from out of town and mike literally saved the day. not only was the house absolutely beautiful (one of the nicest i have stayed in using airbnb) but mike was extremely responsive to any questions i had. the house itself is a great size, has an amazing front garden and back patio and has everything you could need - from extra towels and blankets, to a fully stocked kitchen. the neighborhood is also one of the nicest in the city with great views and beautiful homes surrounding it, a view of downtown, and easy access to great restaurants and bars. overall - an absolutely perfect experience - huge thank you to mike!house is really cute with a beautiful garden and really nice fireplace! also the location is great! what a wonderful home--beautiful place, and very clean. will definitely stay here again!we came to sf to celebrate a graduation. the house was charming and perfect for our needs. the host was very accommodating letting us check in early to get ready for the graduation. the entire family had a wonderful time. also, mike\\'s suggestion for a place to have breakfast was awesome. he was right, sweet maple\\'s millionaires bacon was amazing. we were in town for a classy bachelorette party in the city and this house could not have been more perfect. the pictures didn\\'t do it justice! it\\'s an absolute escape in the one of the best locations in sf. mike was so accommodating. he was kind enough to let us check in early to decorate and check out so we didn\\'t have to haul our bags around the last day. had an absolutely fantastic weekend and would 100% book again. thanks mike!everything in the instructions was clear and easy to navigate. great location, beautiful home!first of all, it would be an understatement to say that my stay at maia\\'s house was fantastic. it was absolutely wonderful. starting with the house itself- the view in the description definitely lives up to the hype, as you can overlook the city just by walking out of a door. next, their dog mara is the best dog ever, and you\\'ll probably end up loving her just as much as i did. at first glance, she looks like a very large and scary dog, but she\\'s actually extremely tame and very very calm. you\\'ll love her. lastly, the hosts of this house are absolutely amazing. they\\'re really nice, offer you help with anything you might need, provide you all of the necessities, and most importantly, they truly make you feel at home.she really provides a unique, personalized, holistic approach to dog training. she not only taught us how to more effectively communicate and interact with our border/dalmatian mixed puppy carlos, but she also addressed diet, nutrition and proper amounts and types of exercise. she was very thorough in figuring out & explaining everything that could affect & help our furry child.\\r\\n\\r\\nnot only does she know more about dogs than anyone i\\'ve ever met, but the woman knows her wine! she introduced us to several new varietals we weren\\'t familiar with. she even did a little tasting for us on the deck while we watched the sunset. nice touch! \\r\\n\\r\\nmy wife and i will definitely be back - even if we have to make up an excuse to train our dog!beverly is a terrific host and dog trainer!  this was my first booking on airbnb and it was perfect in every way.  beverly has a beautiful victorian house, great little dog and is very hospitable.  she worked with my dog and i for several hours and taught us training tips and exercises that worked instantly!  beverly also shared a fabulous bottle of wine, with cheese and crackers in the evening while we admired the amazing lights of san francisco and chatted. she also immediately sent customized follow up dog training information and invited me to ask for help as needed.   highly recommend a stay and training with her and i hope that all my future airbnb experiences are this wonderful--thanks!i had booked the french room and stayed over this past weekend. the whole house was uniquely stunning that we couldn\\'t keep our mouths shut. :)the room was absolutely gorgeous and spacious. camila has been really responsive to my questions until the day i arrived  and as soon as i met her in person, she was just as friendly and generous. most of all, she really made us feel at home and accomodating to our needs which made our stay unforgettable. i\\'ll be coming back again! it is really beautiful and vintage. we use this place to shoot part of our wedding photos~\\r\\nthe manager are very friendly and helpful.the room was absolutely wonderful. the bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. perfectly located, across from buena vista park where the is a great view and the 6 and 71 bus stop right in front of the house. the place is a mansion and you can hardly tell there\\'s anyone else there.\\r\\nthe only con was that you could only lock the door from inside your room, so we had to leave it unlocked during the day. although this didn\\'t bother me so much, my boyfriend was a little worried leaving his laptop around since there are 4/5 other rooms being rented out.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, a great place to stay for a magical experience.what a beautiful place to stay, not the typical hotel experience which is sterile and dull.   my lovely room, is contained in a beautiful home in a nice location.  it was home away from home for me.  camila was a joy to deal and very available should i need anything, as was everyone else that i came in contact with.  i cannot wait to go back!camila is a very nice person and an excellent host. the house itself is amazing....the bedroom, living room, kitchen - even the toilet are pretty. overall - we had wonderful time staying at the house. thanks to camila and her staff!!!camila was a wonderful host and i came away feeling like i had made a good friend.  it was a privilege to stay at the spencer mansion and learn its history from camila, edna, and edwin.  the home is a historic landmark and all of the rooms are decorated to perfection.  san francisco is fortunate to have spencer mansion available to visitors.  the boni family is certainly looking forward to a return visit.  \\r\\nsusan boni\\r\\nphiladelphia, pa this was my first airbnb experience and, honestly, it couldn\\'t have been better! we spent a week in san francisco staying at the spencer mansion and will from now on always consider this to be our home in this city! and what a home that is! a true mansion, a spectacular victorian building maintained in perfect condition and located in a beautiful and convenient area right at the haight. our room was spacious, luminous and romantic and the bed was extremely comfortable. camilia was very friendly and couldn’t have been more helpful with advice on where to eat, drink, walk around. all in all we had an amazing time in sf and we highly recommend the spencer mansion!i planed on staying a weekend at the spencer mansion, but i liked it so much that i extended my stay! first of all, camilla is an excellent host, knows incredible places to go to for food, drinks or culture - besides she is fun to chat with and laid back. you will notice, that the victorian style house is the most beautiful one in haight asbury and footsteps away from the old hippie scene, the best vintage shops, cafés and restaurants. the room is was staying in looks amazing! i felt like a queen! most important: the bed has a very good mattress and i slept very well. the shared rooms, like living - dining room are breathtakingly beautiful and i felt home  - even though i didn\\'t spend much time there. there is a historic kitchen to use with a walk in fridge! :-d i can only repeat how beautiful this house is, inside and out! will go back as much as possible, that\\'s for sure! my wife and i really enjoyed our stay at the spencer mansion. the space itself is amazing, and the location is great; quiet at night, but only a short walk busier areas of haight. camilla was a  very thoughtful host, and had a lot of advice for people new to the city!dear airbnb-travellers, you will love the spencer mansion, the area, the fellow guests and most of all the hosts of the mansion. camila is wonderful and makes all the guests instantly feel at home. and what a charm of building this is. it almost should stay a secret, it is so good. then again, everyone should know about the spencer mansion and enjoy the warm atmosphere in this late 19th century victorian \"castle\" next to buena vista park. a solid 10+. camilla\\'s victorian house is the most amazing place to stay! super comfortable and magnificently decorated. it has a very good location, and a friendly neighborhood with many small cozy restaurants.  she is also a wonderful person and helped us a lot with her suggestions about what to do in and around sf. best recommendations - we truly enjoyed our stay!this house is from fairy tales. staying in spencer\\'s house was a wonderful pleasure. camila is the best! no doubt we will come back  again. \\r\\nthe spencer house is a gorgeous victorian house that has been decorated and carefully curated.  guests have a beautiful room and bath and access to all the common areas such as kitchen, breakfast room, dining room and double parlors. the house is convenient to public transportation and also in a great location for walking. we loved our accommodations, but we loved cami most.  she is energetic and enthusiastic and full of good information. a surprise and extra treat was the opportunity to meet brian chesky, founder of airbnb, who stayed for a couple of days overlapping with us for a night. we plan to come back next year.the spencer mansion is probably the best place you could ask for staying in san francisco! we cannot recommend it enough. camilla and her sister are absolutely gorgeous, the house is just incredible! \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen you wake up in the morning and enjoy your cozy bed inside the spacious and clean room, there is nothing you will miss! the room does have a private bathroom, which is really more like living in a hotel than doing airbnb, and it is super convenient. the whole house is one-of-a-kind, very beautiful and lovely decorated. there is a huge kitchen equipped with everything you might need to prepare a 5-course-menu. you can use everything without limitations and camilla made us feel like home right from the beginning of our stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nthere are actually a lot of people outside of the house taking pictures of it, because it is a tourist feature. it just feels great when you see these tourists and think: \"oh my god, i am a tourist myself, but i actually live here! amazing!\" \\r\\n\\r\\nthe area is very safe, the location is great with \"haight street\" starting just two blocks away, as well as other restaurants and hot spots of the city. there is a bus station right in front of the house that will take you to either \"ocean beach\" (very nice!) or downtown (market st), which is just perfect! \\r\\n\\r\\nwe highly recommend \"espetus churrascaria\" ((url hidden) a brazilian steakhouse. go there, you won\\'t regret it. it was our most amazing restaurant experience in the us, seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe definitely need to say something about two special inhabitants of the mansion: marco and polo. we already miss these guys. the two tomcats are adorable and we really fell in love with them. cutest kitties in sf! :-)\\r\\n\\r\\ncamilla will provide some great tips in her guidebook and she can help you out with every question you might have. \\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this was the best experience and we are so unbelievably happy we found this place. better than any hotel in the city. you get the comfort of a great hotel plus the charming of a local host and a very special experience of living in a beautiful house. \\r\\n\\r\\nas soon as there is the chance, we will come back. simply great and a true gem!      omg cami\\'s mansion is unreal!!! that s probably the most amazing place i have ever stayed in!! we stayed in the french room for 3 nights, and it s one of the highlights for this entire us trip !! not to mention cami is such a lovely easy going person, and so easy to deal with. i think i will be back one day ! thank you cami for letting us stay with you in this amazing mansion ! the spencer mansion is absolutely gorgeous and the french room is stunning! the room is big and bright and the bed was cozy and comfortable. \\r\\n\\r\\ncamila is lovely and gracious and she makes you feel right at home.  the location is also ideal - you can walk to a ton of great bars, restaurants and cafes.  i will definitely be staying here again!camila\\'s is a terrific place to stay: old-world charm in a relaxed atmosphere.  it was exactly what we were looking for.  like others have commented, i highly recommend it,  and hope it stays a secret, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwe loved our stay at the spencer mansion. the mansion is located centrally on haight street, a short bus trip from the downtown area, and around the corner from the panhandle of the golden gate park. we found the location to be a great starting point for our san francisco sightseeing.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room itself was decorated beautifully. everything was matched nicely, and the room definitely had a classical \"french\" feel to it. the bed was super comfortable with luxurious linen. the ensuite was small but functional. we loved the bay window, and if the famous san fran fog had cleared we could just spot the golden gate bridge!\\r\\n\\r\\ncamila was a good host who communicated well. we only met her briefly, but she gave us a great overview of the house. also when we had trouble using the door code one night, camila got back to us relatively quickly. thankfully by that point we\\'d figured out how to get the door to work! we loved her cats marco and polo, and each morning we needed to add an extra 10 mins to our sightseeing just to pat the cats!\\r\\n\\r\\noverall our experience at the spencer mansion was a good one, and we\\'d definitely consider staying there again if we ever get back to san francisco!spencer mansion - french room is one of the biggest highlights of my trip! if you are looking at other apartments/rooms put this one at the top of your list! you will not regret it. it is better than a hotel. the room and house are detailed to the millimeter of complete beauty and perfection. camila and her family are lovely and make you feel right at home. i hadn\\'t researched san francisco very much apart from doing an architectural tour and cami was really happy to share ideas and great places to eat. the japanese tea gardens in golden gate park were beautiful and hog island oysters at the marketplace were just plain yum!\\r\\nif or when i visit san francisco again i will definitely be staying at spencer house again! thanks again cami! :d\\r\\nwe loved our stay here. the house is beautiful and our room was a perfect idyll - my fiancée said it made her feel like a princess, while i slept like a king...\\nthe hosts were wonderfully welcoming and helpful, including the two adorable cats who say hi whenever you come back home.\\ngreat location and a perfect base to explore the city from - and, best of all, no tv so you\\'ll leave with brain and body happy  and relaxed!\\nwe\\'ll be back.what an incredible victorian mansion and a fantastic room to boot! camila was away traveling but her sister was a gracious and informative host. i wish we could have spent more time enjoying the house.an absolutely perfect san francisco experience. the house is amazing, the location perfect  and the host great. i can truly recommend spencer mansion. i loved my stay at the spencer mansion. for my thirteen-year-old daughter, it was a magical experience...something out of a fairy tale! she gasped as soon as she got out of the taxi and looked up at the ornately painted house. camila and carole were delightful, considerate hosts, and we felt privileged to have access to all the beautiful rooms during our stay. the location was also wonderful, sandwiched between historic haight street and bustling divisadero. many great places to walk and have breakfast in close proximity. we (me, my husband and our 4-year-old son) spent three nights in camila\\'s house. camila is a great host and a very interesting person; she is also very knowledgeable of san francisco and its amazing restaurants. the room was beautiful, very clean, and the bed comfortable. we had access to the entire dining area, to the kitchen and to the garden. we really felt at home! thank you, camila!perfect place to stay, camila is a greath person and we had a very good time there. cool kitchen, big housen and pefect bedroom.the spencer mansion is wonderful! it was my first experience with airbnb and i loved it. camila is an excellent host. the location is perfect. the inside of the mansion is reminiscent of downton abbey. you get the luxury of victorian royalty with the convenience of being in the city of san francisco. his lordship would certainly approve!i really enjoyed my stay at this gorgeous victorian mansion. it is a step back into the past, and a totally different experience from a hotel or apartment rental. very comfy bed, peace and quiet. host camilla and her sister carol are so friendly and helpful. attention technology lovers- you can keep in touch online with the wifi, but there is no tv on site, just fyi. i brought my laptop to take care of essentials while there. lots of stairs inside, so be prepared to lug  your luggage up and down. oh- if you need coffee right away in the morning, make sure you buy your own creamer etc (to stow in the walk-in refrigerator!) , and get a lesson on the coffee machine, or you\\'ll have to go cold turkey til you find a coffee shop. the location is great- bus stop right in front going to golden gate park, or the other way (not sure where that went) , and 2 blocks from the #24 divisidero bus taking you to 17th st/castro center- where you get the trolley to head down (up?) market st. to the cable cars or wharfs, and subways to everywhere. all in all, spencer mansion is a really nice experience for those who value history, character, beauty, and charm over elevators and flat screens. i would say it\\'s not ideal for people w/ small kids but what do i know? two great cats to pat, too--- always there to greet you when you come in the back entrance, but they don\\'t have the run of the place. spencer mansion was very clean and welcoming, and by far the most gorgeous private residence in the city! people outside taking pictures all the time, and tour buses pointing it out to their passengers. i would certainly stay there again. spencer house was a wonderful experience. absolutely beautiful. what you see in the photos is true to the experience. camilla was wonderful,helpful and very gracious. thank you camilla! \\r\\na second visit to the spencer house was another great experience in san francisco. this time we stayed in the french & garden rooms and found them clean, quiet and comfortable. the spencer house is conveniently located next to a transit stop and a short walk from the corner of haight & ashbury. hosts camila & carol are very friendly and accommodating. we will return for another visit and continue to recommend a stay at this grand old house.camila is one of the most wonderful persons i have ever met in my life. her warm welcoming and kind help during our stay went beyond just a host. i have been staying more than 30 airbnb listings so far and this is my absolute favorite! my boyfriend and i adore the house and our room. every single detail is just perfect! felt like living in a paris palace in san francisco. i\\'d highly highly recommend this place to anyone who is lucky enough to find it! thank you so much for everything, camila!!!! you are the best of the best!!wonderful home, and accommodating hosts. camila is the most amazing host! always a pleasure working with her :) the best best best in san francisco!!! this is my favourite place to stay in san francisco! truly, this is what airbnb is all about. in a nutshell, cami and carol completely understand what hosting is all about. it\\'s not just their amazing place, but the unforgettable experience they provide for each and every one of their guests. thank you! still the best place in sf for business, personal and everything else. i just love the house and the coolest host-duo: cami and carol. thanks again!!only the best adjectives can be used to describe spencer house and the people that own it!\\r\\n\\r\\ncami was amazing. so polite, considerate and friendly. she made us feel at home instantly and was available if we needed anything. she is an inclusive person, so whatever is going on in the house, you are invited. \\r\\n\\r\\nstaying in the house was a truly great experience. the french room was immaculate and beautifully decorated. amenities were luxury hotel level. \\r\\n\\r\\naside from the house, the location was also excellent. there some really fantastic restaurants and very nice market in walking distance from the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will definitely be back to spencer house. this is as good as airbnbs get.this has been one of our best experiences since we started using airbnb. the places is absolutely astonishing. a fantastic victorian house also with same style furnishings and decoration. we feel at home as we were staying with friends. even the other guest were absolutely interesting and nice people. whatever we can say about the hospitality of the pesce family can´t describe the wonderful hosts they were. cami was most of the time there and has became somebody very special for us. as the gourmet she is, she gave us excellent suggestions. marco and polo (the cats) were really quiet and nice. lovely amenities as amazing shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. delicious cookies. we loved the spencer house and the pesce family. the spencer house is a san francisco treasure, architecturally, interior design and hospitality. cami and carol are exemplary hosts and give a true california welcome. i can not say how much that made my mums holiday.we have traveled far and wide and have been very lucky to stay in some of the most incredible homes, hotels and guest houses in the world.  i can honestly say that i highly doubt you could find anywhere better to stay in san francisco.  this really is as good as it gets and was one of the highlights of our entire stay in california!  we felt at home from the moment we arrived and received a wonderfully warm welcome from cami who genuinely treated us like we were old friends.  throughout our stay we found her advice and local recommendations all excellent without exception.  this elegant home has a very special magic full of history, character, beauty and charm and has been meticulously renovated with great care.  swathed in luxurious fabrics and furnished with exquisitely fine pieces, this must be the very loveliest of all the old victorian houses in the area. the listing is spot on and accurate in every sense but hardly does it justice really because spencer house is actually much better than the pictures!  we really loved the luxury bathroom products and the heavy drapes ensured a peaceful night\\'s sleep.  the french room is wonderfully romantic, beautifully decorated and abundant in every amenity - we enjoyed every minute of our stay.  the dining room and lounges are very well appointed and the most wonderful place to share a nice glass of red wine in the evening.  there are so many incredible period details and secrets to discover around every corner whether it is the ancient, cavernous walk in refrigerator or the enviable collection of copper pans in the kitchen.  the neighborhood felt very safe and  is full of fabulous restaurants, unique shops and all kinds of amenities within easy reach.  when we return we won\\'t think of staying anywhere else and hope to return soon.  thank you for a memorable stay!beautiful house, great location!  had a wonderful stay, the room was one of a kind, and they provided all we needed.  meticulously maintained historic house in fun neighborhood. very lovely hosts, plan on staying there again in the future. highly recommend!i don\\'t have enough words to say how wonderful was our stay at the spencer house! it was everything that we thought it was going to be. cami and carol are the most welcoming hostesses and extremely friendly and cordial. my husband and i loved to french room and all the beautiful (url hidden) was so calm, extremely clean and so comfortable...\\r\\nthe spencer house itself it just amazing. we felt right at home and were always very at home when using every part of the house. the kitchen by far was our favorite place to be!! \\r\\nwe stayed for 5 nights and not once did we take a bus, we walked everywhere from the house...and always felt safe and never had a problem with the neighborhood. the latest we came back was 11:00 pm. beautiful park across the street to visit during the day when the views are just amazing...\\r\\nanyway...we have made the spencer house our san francisco destination for sure!!! can\\'t wait for our next visit...thank you cami and carol (and rhafa) for your fantastic service and friendship!!! \\r\\nthis room was just as amazing as it seems on the pictures. the hosts were very helpful and kind. the house is located in a pretty cosy area with local breakfast places and cool shops. \\r\\nthis is the third time we\\'ve stayed with cami and carol and they never fail to wow us! this is our first time in the french room and it was so perfect for the first two nights of our honeymoon! the house itself is in excellent repair, really it is a model of how an old house deserves to be loved, embraced and appreciated! the room itself is spacious with plenty of storage for your clothes, suitcases and whatever fun items you might pick up wandering around sf. if you have any doubts about staying in this beautiful old house, cast them away! you are much better off here than in a boring hotel! this place is clean, beautiful and you can feel the love and care that is put into this gorgeous mansion. cami was a great host! from the beginning on she explained us everything and showed us the beautiful house. we had the lovely french room and everything was very clean and nicely decorated. the location is really nice, central and safe. it was special for us to stay in this beautiful victorian house and would definitely come back! spencer house is amazing, and definitely exceeded my expectations.  it\\'s a beautiful place, and the host is extremely welcoming.  i even got to hear a bit about the history of the house!  the location was also super convenient, and is just across the street from buena vista park.this is a lovely house in a lovely neighbourhood! i strongly recommend staying here.the spencer house is the best place to stay when i travel to sf.  the mansion is breathtaking, and it\\'s neighborhood is the most accessible in the city.   so beautifully kept and super cozy!  cami and carol are on point!  they\\'re really helpful and accommodating and quick to respond when planning a last minute trip.\\r\\n\\r\\neasy to do your own thing and keep to yourself if you like, but there\\'s always an opportunity to socialize with other guests in the common areas.  cami and carol create a warm and welcoming space, and it\\'s always a pleasure meeting new people over a bottle of wine or a home cooked meal from the incredible kitchen.  can\\'t wait to come back!always always - the best host, camila! thank you for treating every guest like family and opening your incredible home to them :) what can i say that hasn\\'t already been said. the spencer house is one of san francisco\\'s gems. it\\'s the perfect combination of amazing host and unique home. there is so much warmth and hospitality in this house, you\\'ll leave feeling like part of the family. highly recommend staying here!loved this place! \\r\\n\\r\\nhost couldn\\'t have made me feel more welcome - they offered me wine and food, and were really easy going and friendly.\\r\\nthe room itself was gorgeous! very girlie : ) and in a really great position right on haight beautiful home and gorgeous room. we truly enjoyed our stay and meeting cami & carol. this is san francisco\\'s, i guess not so hidden, gem. and so is cami! staying here was a unique experience. \\r\\n\\r\\na lot of the victorian era sf houses are divided into units so it\\'s difficult to tap into that (very) old san francisco feel. so the spencer house is pretty special in remaining faithful to its old form. it\\'s remarkably well renovated so the house is very well-heated at all hours, constant hot water, modern kitchen etc. the room, bathroom, kitchen & the dining area were all spotless. oh and cami seamlessly slipped fresh soft towels in my bathroom every few days (hotel experience in a home). every detail in the house is beautiful, even the clothes hangers in this room were awesome (seriously). the bed is too comfortable, so it was tough to get up early and go to work. \\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s only a few blocks from haight ashbury and the golden gate park (and the de young museum & academy of sciences are basically right there in the park) on one end, and steps away from divisadero, castro, walking distance to dolores/mission area on the other end.\\r\\n\\r\\ncami is delightful. we had lovely chats throughout my stay accompanied by either some peppermint tea, or a few glasses of wine or the adorable cats marco & polo. she had great recommendations and stories. you can truly feel at home in this fabulous san francisco mansion when cami is around. oh and when i arrived on my first night, cami grabbed my gigantic suitcase and carried it all the way upstairs for me!!!\\r\\n\\r\\ni can\\'t do the  spencer house & the hosts justice within these word limits, but it\\'s a summary. thank you cami:) if you\\'re ever in ireland or istanbul, let me know!cami and carol never fail to wow me :d not only is their home absolutely drop-dead gorgeous, but these women are to of the coolest, kindest, and most hospitable you will ever meet. this is my second time booking at the spencer house, and i will continue to book again and again. i can\\'t possibly say enough about how magical this place is. \\r\\nalways incredible! can\\'t help but not keep returning! cami and carol were incredibly accommodating hosts. the spencer house is a rare gem in san francisco. an absolute must visit in a fantastic location. cami and carol are the best hosts. they are very courteous, and helpful and the house in itself is a gem. when i get a chance, would love to stay at the house again.\\r\\n\\r\\n-vishalthank you so much for everything! the best hosts of san francisco!!!spencer house is terrific!  cami and carol are the most lovely hosts - friendly, welcoming, helpful, and delightful to talk with, but also happy to give guests whatever space they want/need.  the house is a gem: full of historic detail, spotless and comfy, with cozy beds, clean rooms, great towels and sheets.  the location is excellent as well, close to golden gate park, downtown, the haight, etc. basically, cami and carol hit all the notes perfectly at spencer house, and i\\'d highly recommend staying there.cami and carol are kind, thoughtful and wonderful hosts. i had a great stay in the gorgeous french room. i would love to come back!words don\\'t do justice to how absolutely wonderful these hosts are and how beautiful this home is. cami and carol are the model airbnb hosts. they communicate clearly and politely, there is no task too small or big for them and they are so warm and welcoming. i have already raved about them to my friends and family so i\\'d stop reading this and go ahead and book your accommodation with them this is the second time i stayed with camila in this gorgeous magical house. camila\\'s warm welcoming and amazing hospitality have always  made me feel home in her place. highly recommend it to anyone who is lucky enough to find this place!\\r\\ncami and carol are the best! i booked the french room for a visiting colleague and they were exemplary hosts. communication is super fast and reliable and they went out of their way to help me on several occasions. i would highly recommend them as hosts and can\\'t wait for an opportunity to stay at spencer house myself!cami and carol were absolutely wonderful. totally welcoming and very attentive. i felt at home immediately. not the mention, this room made me feel like a princess :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is also beautiful and super convenient! the house is absolutely amazing. they are wonderful hosts that can help you with everything. the neighbourhood is really cool and special too. i

good time staying with them in sf!we really enjoyed our stay in helen\\'s apartment. it was perfect for our family of 4 (two kids 4 & 1 ). helen was kind enough to provide a pack & play as well as a highchair so we didn\\'t have to lug around more kid stuff that we were already.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe also arrived by car and helen met us upon arrival and gave us a parking spot (hers) steps away from the

standard in the bay)\\r\\n\\r\\nlooking forward to our next trip back! helen is fantastic.  she and her husband are incredible hosts.  the apartment is just as described clean and comfortable.

house is neat, clean and well maintained. naveen\\'s place is the best. naveen himself and his nephew mickey are very friendly and welcoming hosts - best advices about the city, random chitchats, offers for drinks and delicious home cooked food! i felt myself safe and comfortable. i got an opportunity to meet one of naveen\\'s friends cathy, and mickey\\'s girlfriend. this is what i call best airbnb experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe room and bathroom were very clean and renovated, kitchen is equipped with everything needed. naveen is flexible with dates and checkins/checkouts to make a stay even more convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nrussian hill is my favourite location in sf, everything is walkable distance away,  the neighbourhood is safe and clean.  lots of restaurants and bars, great views. thanks naveen!\\r\\nnaveen and his nephew mike were incredibly hospitable. will stay here again the next time i visit san francisco :) the neighbourhood\\'s location was great - just a mile away from union square. the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.i arrived in noe valley to visit with my new grandchild.....and wanted to be in walking distance to my son\\'s house on clipper street.  luckily buck lucas had listed his bedroom plus great room and garden which was just three blocks away.  i settled in and found the remodeled apartment absolutely wonderful.  breakfast in the garden provided by buck, flowers in the bedroom, everything clean and beautiful.  it was a joy to stay here and to get o know buck.we booked last minute and had the place all to ourselves since buck had a trip planned. we had a lovely stay, it couldn\\'t have been better.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe photos of the apartment don\\'t do it justice - the apartment is spectacular, modern with a lovely open plan. i think that\\'s a plus but it is something to know, if you prefer more private spaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is convenient and it was nice to be able to stroll just a short block to coffee and restaurants.location, location, location! we really slept well in this beautiful designer apartment even though the bedroom is on the smaller side. the rest of the apartment is very spacious and roomy. we loved buck\\'s organic breakfast choice, and had the feeling he cared a great deal about his guests. buck is very polite, friendly, helpful, a great restaurant guide, and generally just a nice guy. he stayed on the lower level and allowed us a lot of privacy.we had a wonderful time staying in buck\\'s apartment. it is located in a great spot, close to 24th in noe and to the mission. beautiful living room with a lovely back patio. clean and comfortable. buck was great!my stay at buck\\'s beautiful apartment in noe valley was perfect! the apartment itself is very pretty, nicely renovated kitchen and gorgeous patio. buck was a wonderful host; he gave me useful information about local restaurants and even came up with a list of suggestions for bike rides in and around san francisco.\\ni felt right at home thanks to his hospitality.\\nthe location of this apartment is great, right around the corner from the hub of noe valley\\'s bustling street scene but far enough away to be quiet and peaceful. would stay here again in a heartbeat! thanks, buck!i had a great stay here. buck was in france, but sent plenty of notes and recommendations via email and text. he was very responsive to my concerns and helped me work through a huge misunderstanding from abroad. thanks, buck!tell others in the airbnb community about your stay.despite of some technical problems on my side at the beginning, buck was always very understanding and caring. i got in late and even got a lift from bart. the house is in a great neighbourhood with cafes and a wholefood market. kitchen and living room was for shared use with buck, with the guest room i had my own bath. \\r\\ngreat over all experience. highly recommendable! i will stay with buck again once back in sanfran. thx!my husband and i had a great week at buck lucas’s beautiful apartment. this contemporary 2-story apartment is set back from the street, so it has a very quiet and serene feeling. we enjoyed sitting out in the back yard/deck. the location was convenient to our daughter’s place in the mission and we loved having whole foods just around the block.\\r\\n\\r\\nbuck was a very thoughtful and nice host and we enjoyed talking with him. the bed was comfortable and we liked spending time in the bright great room/kitchen area outside the bedroom.we had a wonderful stay at buck\\'s appartment. the location at noe valley is just great, close to the 24th street and ground transportation. this neighbourhood is very nice, safe, kind of family spirit. buck is a very nice and friendly host, we felt really comfortable. his appartment is very well arranged and appropriate for a stay like we had. buck gave us many hints about where to go in the area, especially for eating. we would definitely recommand this place especially if you like quiet and peaceful places.my husband and i had a great, last-minute stay with buck. he was very responsive during the booking process, which was only three days before our stay. we had a bit of a hard time getting the keys- we had about 4 hours when we couldn\\'t get in touch with buck- but that was resolved and buck was extremely apologetic about the mix-up. as other reviewers have noted, the apartment is gorgeous, quiet, and in fabulous noe valley. the bedroom is lovely, and the bed is incredibly comfortable too. we even found parking within a couple blocks and left our car there for the entire three days (no small feat in sf). we\\'d stay here again in a heartbeat.  my daughter and i stayed at buck\\'s gorgeous apartment for six days.  immaculate, perfect location, lovely outdoor space, beautifully appointed interior, great kitchen, lots of privacy - these are just some of the qualities that spring to mind.  buck himself is courteous and thoughtful, interesting and insightful. for instance, my luggage came a few days late, so he lent me his clothes.  my daughter was starting college, so we had a lot of heavy bags, and he virtually single handedly brought them all down the stairs for us. he gave us great references for where to eat.  i could go on and on. nothing negative to report at all.   we spent a girls weekend, myself, my friend chelsea, and her 6 year old, bryn, in sf at buck\\'s place. right in the heart of noe valley, there is really no need to leave: mani/pedi places, coffee shops, boutiques, fab restaurants and groceries allow for having an active day while ensuring wine, cheese, and baguettes are enjoyed on the fabulous outdoor patio buck has designed and landscaped. looking to check out more of sf? the j-line was used frequently as our link to all other areas and is a short 3 blocks away. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apt. is modern and clean. the girls were \"wowed\" when i brought them in. we remarked during our stay how unbelievably quiet it was: no street noise or neighbors were heard. \\r\\n\\r\\nas there we three of us, we made full use of all the comfy pillows that were provided as well as the inflatables mattress buck kindly left out. he also invited us to make ourselves completely at home and help ourselves to anything in the fridge, etc. as much as we tried not to infringe on this invitation, the cold beer was a welcome refreshment upon our arrival after a long day of airports. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe will definitely rent this place again and will suggest it to any friends visiting this area. \\r\\n\\r\\ni had a wonderful stay at buck’s place. his place is in a great location and the apartment is gorgeous. buck is very courteous, accommodating and very prompt in responding to emails. i will try to stay at buck’s place again during my next visit to san francisco. i\\'m a regular business traveler to sf and thought i\\'d give airbnb a try as an alternative to a hotel stay... \\r\\n\\r\\nmy first experience could not have been better. buck was an excellent host! his home is beautiful, very comfortable and the location is very convenient to public transit, major freeways and 24th st. shops and restaurants. \\r\\n\\r\\ni look forward to returning on my next trip to sf! we stayed 5 days with buck lucas last week. our room was on the second floor along with a bath and the kitchen and dining area. the queen bed was extremely comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n at the back of the main area was a glass wall opening into a fabulous secluded hillside garden with gorgeous redwood decking and wonderful plants artistically placed. it was so dramatic we showed it to our daughter and son-in-law (our reason for staying in noe valley).  buck was a great host and extended himself in every way.  we hope to stay there again.i did not meet the host.  he was out of town for the weekend.  he left detailed instruction for picking up the key.  the unit was spotless.  light, airy, fully equipped.  my room was quiet and private.  there is a garden off the kitchen/dining area that would have been delightful on a less windy, cool day.  absolutely no issues.\\r\\nthe neighborhood is as convenient as you can get in noe valley.  one short block to coffee shops, fine restaurants, diners, whole foods, shopping, buses.  \\r\\nall in all a pleasure. buck\\'s home is in a great location and was perfect for my business trip to sf.  i look forward to the next stay!we had an amazing two days in san francisco staying in buck\\'s place. it is beautifully located in the charming noe valley neighbourhood, which is everything you expect from san francisco - the steep inclining streets, lovely little cafés and smiling people everywhere. we loved it!\\r\\n\\r\\nbuck\\'s apartment is a gem. hidden behind the typical san francisco facade, this is a luxurious and modern, yet relaxed-style two-level place - with a great atrium space for enjoying the mornings and evenings between your sightseeing. it had everything we needed for our san francisco break - except that we never got to meet buck, who trusted us to be alone in his apartment while he was away for the weekend. we appreciate buck\\'s trust as well as his help with everything over the phone. \\r\\n\\r\\ndon\\'t miss dolores park and tartine bakery & café a few blocks away, where you will find some of the best pastry you have ever tasted. it\\'s a long line, but sitting at the top of dolores park, sipping your latte and enjoying your passion fruit and coconut cake with a breathtaking view of san francisco, is an experience you will never forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe will definitely return to san francisco and buck\\'s place. thank you buck!i could not have possibly asked for a better host than buck or a nicer place to stay! not only was buck\\'s home totally gorgeous (tons of light, spacious, extremely comfortable bed, very nice private bathroom with good water pressure and a beautiful patio area where i enjoyed eating meals), but the neighborhood was great too-- very near public transportation (and easy to navigate, even for sf newbies like me!), extremely safe (i walked around at night and never felt the least bit worried), and tons of cute shops, restaurants, and grocery stores (including whole foods) less than a 5 minute walk away. last but not least, buck was extremely friendly, accommodating, welcoming, helpful, responsive, and basically went out of his way to make sure that my stay at his place was perfect. all in all i greatly enjoyed staying with buck and would highly highly recommend it! i\\'m really glad i stayed here instead of at a hotel!a beautiful place to stay that was spotlessly clean and well organised. lots of lovely decorative touches. buck communicated well throughout all our dealings with him and was very hospitable. his home is in a great neighbourhood and his recommendations were fantastic. meet buck very briefly before he left on his travels. thank you buck for trusting us to be in your home for 5 nights.  loved having a bit of space to relax in after a full day in san francisco.  we enjoyed the neighourhood with local cafes, restaurants and the wholefoods supermarket within 5 min walk away. house was central to various muni stops. would recommend getting a muni pass as this allows multiple use for all transport, very economical and efficient.  bucks recommendations for the local cafes etc were excellent and we tried nearly all of them.  thank you we loved san francisco. our stay at buck\\'s place was perfect. buck is a great host! he made us feel very welcome in his beautiful and spacious apartment. \\r\\nthe bedroom is small, but the bed is comfortable and there was a closet next to the bathroom, where we could leave our stuff. \\r\\nthe kitchen had everything we needed and more. sitting outside to drink coffee or read or watch hummingbirds and squirrels was one of our favorite things after a long walk. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is safe and friendly, there are very good coffee places and restaurants around the block. the mission is only a 15 minute walk away. when we went back to the airport, we made the trip to 24th mission bart by walk (with all our luggage) in less than half an hour. \\r\\n\\r\\nthere was nothing missing, it was a perfect stay. buck was a fantastic host and his room was amazing. we booked on really late notice and he was so helpful helping us get in and settled. if you are looking for a great noe valley experience, i highly suggest staying with buck!buck was a great host, welcoming but gave me enough space to do my own thing.  he even helped me carry my case down the stairs :)\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house was beautiful and a pleasure to be in.  the room itself was spacious and quiet and a perfect spot for seeing a more local side to san fran.buck was a great host.  very welcoming and considerate.  check in and check out was very easy.  he provided helpful suggestions on restaurants and things to do in the city that only a local would know.\\r\\n\\r\\nhe has a nice apartment --- modern design, open and airy.  my bedroom was on the top floor with its own bathroom.  the kitchen and living area for the apartment are also on this floor, but buck is incredibly considerate and quiet.  i had a great night\\'s sleep -- the bedroom was very quiet since the windows do not face the street and the bed was incredibly comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is excellent in a real neighborhood -- definitely not touristy.  tons of local coffee shops, restaurants, etc.  easily walkable to the mission and castro.  plus it was a short walk to the muni, which made it easy to get into the center of the city.my stay at buck\\'s place was very enjoyable. buck was an excellent host. he provided detailed instructions on how to pick up the keys and even gave suggestions on where to eat. the neighbourhood was safe even at night and the walk to the bus stop was less than 5 mins which means taking the muni (j church line) to union square, fisherman\\'s wharf etc was convenient. many food options in the neighbourhood too. and there is a whole foods just around the corner. the bedroom is located on the 2nd floor and the toilet is just outside of the room, with a cupboard beside it. very convenient for hanging your clothes. his place is very clean and he provided travel books on san francisco too. i will definitely stay at his place again when i visit san francisco again. buck was incredibly accommodating and kind. his place is well cared for and extremely comfortable. noe valley is an picturesque neighborhood and buck provided great details for restaurants and transportation. i am already planning on coming back and staying here again, great overall

time i visit sf. the apartment is great and the standard is good. stayed there for one night and have no complaints. would\\'ve liked to stay longer. be sure to know that if you\\'re picking up keys at the cafe, it closes at 7.30. we spent five nights in this amazing apartment in december. \\n\\nsid was a fantastic host. he made our stay really comfortable and surprised us with giving much more than we expected. he kindly transported us from and the airport, offered drinks and good food and helped with lots of useful information.\\n\\nthe flat was absolutely amazing with the greatest views i can imagine. from our room we could see the bay bridge, fisherman\\'s wharf, coit tower and the skyscrapers of the business district. the living room has big windows with truly awesome panoramic views to the city and the see with the alcatraz.\\n\\nour bedroom was clean, cosy. the bed was big and comfortable. \\n\\nthe location of the flat is very good. it took only 5 minutes to walk to fisherman\\'s wharf and 30 minutes walking to get to city centre. we didn\\'t use public transport but the stops are very close. there are plenty of good restaurants in fisherman\\'s wharf and on columbus ave. also there is a trader joe\\'s grocery store in short walking distance. \\n\\nwe really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again. sid is the perfect host and his place has the best view in the city! \\r\\nhe picked us up from the airport and dropped us there when we departed. he always has clean towels and his place is always tidy. the fridge is always stocked and he even put bottle water in your room. it was a little cold when we were there and he put a heater for us the second day without us asking. this is how detail oriended your host would be, think about it! it\\'s like living in a hotel without breaking your bank account. besides, he goes extra miles to reseach for the city\\'s history and knows a whole lot about the city, your great guide if you visit sf for the first time. i will definitely recommend his place to anyone visiting sf and i am already planning for another trip to sf with my family. see you soon sid and thank you for the amazing stay! sid is a rockstar, the most delightful host i have stayed with so far! he went beyond what i expected - pick-up & drop from the airport, excellent courteousness & hospitality, food, towels, really opened up his house to us..\\r\\n\\r\\nalso btw his place is amazing - location is perfect, best view of the bay and the hills, you wont find such amazing views in san francisco for so cheap! highly recommend..the apartment is located very conveniently to some of the best dining spots in sf. it is bright and spacious. sid and brian are very helpful and approachable.\\nthere is a convenient avis rent-a-car office couple of blocks away to get or drop a car for a longer journeys.sid was an excellent host, from the first communication to the last handshake. \\r\\n\\r\\nhis willingness to pick me up and take me to the airport was what secured my decision. taxi fares are exorbitant in sf, so this makes staying with sid more valuable than many other places. \\r\\n\\r\\nhis place is in a perfect location, within walking distance of many of san francisco\\'s most famous attractions and fun places to eat or drink. \\r\\n\\r\\nif you are conscious of cost or just like to eat in, being able to use sid\\'s kitchen was also a major plus. he has a well-stocked kitchen with just about anything you would need to cook and enjoy a meal. he also allows use of his state-of-the-art washing and drying machines, iron, and professional-quality steamer (perfect for getting wrinkles out quickly).\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view from the bedroom is amazing, and from the living room the panoramic views of the bay are truly inspiring. \\r\\n \\r\\nsid even helped me out of a jam, technically after my stay had ended. i needed a ride to the store in order to make an impromptu flag football game happen, and sid not only drove me to the store, he also drove me to where i needed to go afterward, even allowing me to keep my bags at his place until later. it\\'s this willingness to go the extra mile that makes sid stand out from the rest. \\r\\n\\r\\nall in all, sid is an excellent host. i would definitely stay with sid again if i am in the area again.sid gave me the best airbnb experience i had so far. the experience started with a pick-up from the sfo airport directly to his apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment is in great shape and sid made sure that i truly feel home. he almost insists on you eating of his well filled kitchen ;)\\r\\nas with everything he does it\\'s the \"four season\\'s\" experience.\\r\\nthis was definitely beyond my expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment has a spacious kitchen & living area that you can use. the kitchen appliances include a microwave, ice machine and dishwasher. the view from the living room towards alcatraz is stunning.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you want to meet new people this place is a great opportunity, sid has many guests and there is always something going on where you can join the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended!a nice place with a nice view from the room and the livingroom! very clean and sid was very friendly and helpful. sid has set a new standard for all of airbnb. extremely accommodating and offering 5-star service, sid has set out to provide the best overall experience you can get. i highly recommend and will absolutely stay here again. thank you!gorgeous penthouse views!  sid was very helpful in making sure we knew where we were going.  although he was called away for work, his room mate was very accommodating as well.  very clean and neat, great space.  good location close to little italy and fisherman\\'s wharf, easy access to public transit.  i would stay here again when in san francisco.my wife and i arrived on the 19th and found the apartment everything it was advertised to be. the panoramic view from the living room is awesome and the view from the bedroom was not too shabby either. we were greeted by brian and he couldn\\'t have been more accommodative. unfortunately sid was out of town on business but stayed in touch on email. all in all we enjoyed our week in san francisco due in large part to these affordable accomodations and the help from brian. i would recommend sid\\'s place to any one going to sf the location cant be beat.    even if staying with sid was our first airbnb experience, we can surely say that he is something special. he is a super host and makes sure that you have everything you need. in fact he does not hesitate to go the extra mile. he inviteted us to his work and showed us his awesome office, ordered us food and a ride back and force to the apartment which is super awesome by the way. \\nin addition to this, sid even drove us to the airport to make sure that we get there in time and safely.\\nso, if you want to have a great time in a great city, an awesome apartment with panoramic view and a super cool host, you should definitely stay with sid. \\nwe would do every time again.sid was very kind and gracious so much so that he picked us up from emeryville after our train ride. was very welcoming, gave us a great tour. sid and brian are a couple of amazing people who i\\'d be honored to stay with again, truly like family. thank you! great room and host, thanks sid!a five star, amazing experience.  i cannot recommend sid dessai any more highly.  he is the most conscientious, generous host you could ever imagine.  the physical space is spectacular.  so if you combine an amazing host with an astounding physical environment, you get travel nirvana.\\r\\n\\r\\nplease note, it is third story walkup on a steep street.  the tradeoff is the view is the best view of the bay you could ask for.my fiancee and i stayed with sid for 2 nights in sf and had a great time. his apartment is in a very nice spot, with beautiful views of the bay / san francsico right from you room. moreover, the apartment is in great condition - it seems newly renovated with all the comforts of home included. last but not least, sid was extremely accommodating. he was flexible with the check-in / check-out process, and even offered pick us up from our previous spot in sf with his car. we immediately felt comfortable from the moment we saw him. don\\'t hesitate to stay here! we would definitely come back here again. \\n sid \"magnificent\" so you can call the owner of the house, with stunning views of san francisco. my wife and i arrived early, and sid gave us our room. it was very handy as we had a long road and we were tired. thank you, sid!\\n the bed is very comfortable, from the bedroom a balcony overlooking the attractions sf.\\n we spent five unforgettable days in sid’s place in san francisco! great place! beautiful !!!\\n\\n\\n thanks to sid (and bryan for sure) we had the best experience of san francisco ever.\\nfor sure the place is amazing (and we are still dreaming about the perfection of the sheets!) but it is very few in comparison of the kindness of our hosts. no kidding we felt really at home. thanks again for that amazing souvenir!we loved staying at sid\\'s place and you will too.  sid was the best host, we felt like we were staying with a good friend from the minute we arrived. san francisco is hilly but sid\\'s place is only up a small incline, a few blocks from the cable car and fisherman\\'s wharf.  sid supplies all the comforts of home and more.  he was a most gracious host and if we get to visit the beautiful city of san fran again, we wouldn\\'t waste our time searching for other accommodation, as we wouldn\\'t be able to find any.  you need to stay at sid\\'s place!!sid was a great host and

to see him the last couple of days that we stayed at his place, but he always made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed when he wasn\\'t there. he even drove us to the bart station on our way to the airport, which was was really helpful since we were in a rush and the buses can sometimes take a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe listing is exactly what we expected and more. the views were awesome, and his place has a porch that we relaxed on at night and in the mornings. having the washer and drier in the unit is also a lot of help since we needed to do some laundry.\\r\\n\\r\\nhis place is so close to all of the tourist attractions, which is great for us since we were able to walk there instead of having to take public transportation. whenever i go back to san francisco, i\\'m not going to look anywhere else.sid was a brilliant host and made us feel very welcome. he picked us up from the airport, organised breakfast for us and gave us very useful tips and local advice with what we were interested in doing in san francisco. he basically made sure we had a great start to our trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nhis flat was very clean, well kept, spacious & comfortable. we immediately felt very at home there. the views were also amazing!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighbourhood was centrally located and near to attractions such as lombard st (the crookedest st), fisherman\\'s wharf, pier 39 & pier

wouldn\\'t hesitate in recommending this place.  fantastic location with awesome views of the city!  we felt the view was so good from the apartment that we didn\\'t even go up coit tower!  sid was a great host - thanks for everything!this was my first time staying in a private room with shared bathroom. i\\'d say sid is a great host, bathroom was kept clean by him daily so it didn\\'t care to share it because we always would have clean towels and a clean bathroom...he handled transportation for us from the airport to his place and he was very welcoming by the time we arrived.  his place has one of the greatest views from the bay you can find. it\\'s located very close to fisherman\\'s wharf and north beach which makes it a nice place to walk around,  specially at dinner times. as for the place,  our room was exactly as shown in the pictures, he also provided us with water during the whole stay. we also were able to use his washing machine during our stay which out to be very helpful.  as for the kitchen we didn\\'t use it except for one time so no reviews on it.  everything for this place is great and it has a great relationship between the price and value. keep in mind that sid and his roommate rent as much as three rooms all the time in his place so if you stay for a long period like we did you\\'d see lots of different guests, some of them cleaner and nicer than others. sid did everything he could to make our stay comfortable and pleasant. he even organized to get us picked up from the airport, left some complimentary water in the room and offered his help for any possible question we would face. he is definitely the master air bnb hosts in the sf area! not to speak about the fantastic view from his apartment.as has been stated by many other travelers, sid is a great host!!  his apartment is in a really convenient location (walking distance to many attractions & easy access to all forms of public transit).  the apartment is kept scrupulously clean which is important to us as travelers sharing space with other travelers.  we met several interesting people who were staying in the other rooms at sid\\'s apartment (from france and spain).  the views from sid\\'s apartment are among the best views that we had during our stay in san francisco.  overall, we had a great time and we are already looking forward to our next trip.  sid’s place is in a perfect location. it is within walking distance to many attractions such as lombart street, fisherman’s wharf, public transit, et al. the rooms have a great view which overlooking alchtraz, bay bridge, coit tower and san francisco downtown. \\r\\nsid was out of town on business while we were there, but he always made sure that we had everything we needed and stayed in touch on email. we checked out a couple of restaurants recommended by sid and we had one of the best italian dishes. we would definitely recommended sid’s place to anyone going to san francisco and we will absolutely stay here again.another great stay at sid\\'s apartment & this time, i had the pleasure of meeting his roommate,  brian.  the apartment was nice and clean, with plenty of clean linens and complimentary bottled water.  if you are comfortable sharing common areas with other travelers and you are neat &  respectful, you\\'ll be happy with the accommodations. even the taxi driver who picked us up to go to the airport commented that sid\\'s place has one of the best views in the city.  we\\'ll definitely be staying at sid\\'s again. thanks for your hospitality. the room was exactly as it\\'s pictured. the views of the entire city are unbelievable. the location was perfect. i would highly recommend staying here. thanks for your hospitality, you were a great host!perfect stay ! great flat with all the conveniences !\\nvery recommanded !\\nthanks for all sid was there to meet me when i first got there. he made me feel very welcome. the place was quiet. it was just what i needed! he even gave me a ride to where i needed to go when i left. thanks for a great stay!sid was a great host. he picked us at the airport when we arrived. \\r\\nthe condo was exactly as described. it is a 3 bedroom with 2 bathrooms and a very large living room and kitchen. it was very clean and bathrooms were refreshed on a daily basis. it has a great views and location is ideal. definitely would recommend. sid was not in town during our stay in san francisco but his housemate - brian was there to host us in at our convenient time.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe entire place is neat and clean and basically everything in the fridge is free of charge (including wine and booze) as part of the sid desai experience!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe view from our room was amazing (i tried to wake-up early to catch sunrise but it was foggy).\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, this place is amazing. if you are up for an open itinerary (do what the locals do), this is the right place for you. even if you are a tourist, this place is 3 blocks away from major attractions such as fishermen\\'s wharf, lombard street and cable car stations.staying with sid is like having a cousin in sf that you can stay with. what a great guy, great host, awesome place, perfect location, and above and beyond service. i will never stay anywhere else in san francisco again. thanks sid for a great, short visit.very wonderful  & convenient place\\nkey attractions are very near,\\nand what\\'s more,  the transportation is convenient around this area. \\nabove all, sid is very kind\\nwe had a great experience in san francisco! the sid desai experience did not disappoint. if you visit the bay area and don\\'t stay with sid, it is your loss. we really like staying at the apartment we stay sid. he is a great host, received us with great attention! gave us several tips about san francisco, was perfect! we had a lot of food available for breakfast and other meals, all very good! anyway, we recommend everyone stay hosted with sid !!!sid\\'s house is much better than i expected,location is very good,we could walk to fisherman\\'s whalf in 5 mints,the view from window is amazing!this area with many beautiful house,i just

down one of the best experience i had on airbnb. sid is the most accommodating and welcoming host ever.  he will pick you up from the airport, stock your room with water, give tips about the city etc.sid went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and easy. he even picked us up from the airport! he was friendly and accommodating. our room was quiet and super comfortable. the bed and pillows were like home. we slept like babies. shower had amazing water pressure and there was even a steamer we could use to press our outfits for a holiday party. definitely staying here whenever i come back.3 main comments:\\r\\n>> the location: there is no better location in sf: right in the corner of little italy, russian hill and fisherman warf. perfect connection with public transport.\\r\\n>> the view: from sid\\'s place, you can see, everything that matters: golden gates, pyramid tower, alcatraz and the other big bridge (don\\'t remember the name)\\r\\n>>my host: sid is doing everything to make your time in sf as perfect as possible. he is incredible, although he is pretty busy with his job, sid and his girlfriend really invested his time to make sure i was comfortable.  he helped me to know more not only about the city, but the sf people, and their way of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you mate!  sid was an awesome host. he goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is great. the views are amazing from the apartment and the location is perfect. this is the best airbnb place i\\'ve ever lived! \\r\\nthe location is just perfect, every morning i was waken up by the blue sky, sunshine and breeze. the best view of san fran is just from my balcony, i could see the golden gate bridge, the bay bridge, alcatraz, coit tower and sausalito, pretty much everything! it was one of my sweetest memories of this year - having ice-cream and sun chips whiling enjoying the panoramic view. i wish i could be back soon!\\r\\nthe best part of town is just a few blocks away, i took a walk to the pier after having a delicious dinner in a thai restaurant nearby. at that moment, i didn\\'t feel like a traveler, but a local who had a home here.\\r\\nwhat makes this place really stunning is the host - sid is such an amazing person, his kindness and hospitality made my stay in san francisco so memorable, thank you so much sid! he did everything to make sure i had a comfortable stay: clean towels in the bathroom, sleeping mask in the drawer, coffee and snacks in the kitchen... i was really lucky to get to know sid through airbnb. \\r\\nvery highly recommend, i will definitely come back and visit. \\r\\n\\r\\nall was very good.  sid is an excellent communicator, despite being in a distant time zone.  i strive to do the same when i host.  his place is  indeed a very pleasant place to be.  i was in town mostly for business, and it is a breeze to get downtown to the financial district from russian hill.  the neighborhood itself is very nice--you quickly feel like you are living in the city--many good places to walk to and never problem getting an uber car if you need one.  the whole area had a floral aroma from the trees (not sure what kind of trees--maybe acacia or jasmine or olive?)--wonderful!  san francisco is buzzing and is a great city--i have only positive things to report.\\r\\n\\r\\ntomsid was attentive and helpful every step of the way. i was traveling with my 12 year old daughter, and we both thought sid was a great host and would stay at his place again in a heartbeat. also, the location itself is perfect, especially if you\\'re experiencing san francisco for the first time. great views, and well located.sid is a great host. the appartment reminds me of a very well maintained hotel room. everything is super clean and nicely prepared. the view is stunning from every room. awesome view of sf bay, bay bridge, coit tower and the sf skyline. one night i spent on the sofa, just looking out of the window. all in one, a really good experience. everything was excellent...even better than advertised.  we found ourselves unexpectedly in sf with no agenda and walking from russian hill to everywhere was how we got around. the apartment was  a fabulous and convenient place to be located. the neighborhood itself is perfect for tourists looking to discover sf.  sid was unfortunately called out of town on the day we arrived, however despite being half way around the world, he kept us informed and assisted as needed.  perfect spot for us...\\r\\nthanks sid...hope to meet you next time.our new home away from home.  my husband and i stayed with sid for two weeks, and we were honestly  sad to leave.  the location is exquisite- central to everything. the apartment itself is a great safe haven after touring about the city.  we will be back, and have already recommended the location to friends, and family.  that being said the location is nothing with sid, he was such a pleasure and welcomed us wholeheartedly into the fold of things in san fran. beautiful place - sid and anne made sure that i had anything i needed. will definitely come back, didn\\'t want to leave.great place and very accommodating host.sid\\'s place is an absolute find in san francisco. i had tea each morning on the terrace and took in a view of the entire city. i was attending a conference for work at fort mason, which is an easy walk from the apartment. there\\'s a walgreen\\'s very close by which is great for last minute essentials. sid\\'s housemate was gracious and very welcoming! i would definitely stay here again.we definitely felt welcome at sid\\'s place. it was located in a terrific neighborhood and was easy to find from our cab. we had all the amenities we needed and really felt like we were the only ones staying. we never had an issue with the shared bathroom and our view was tremendous! i would recommend sid\\'s place to anyone and everyone who ever asked us about san francisco! it\\'s a no brainer!sid\\'s place was perfect.  clean and bright with great views.  easy walking to columbus street and the wharf.  i couldn\\'t have asked for a better location.  it is a great place to stay and a great way to visit san francisco.sid is very nice host. i\\'m glad that booked the room at his place. great view and very convenient. i love the place. thanks for helping me to get my friend. he give some good suggestions. i had wonderful time in sfo.we were welcomed professionally to sid\\'s ideally located and well-maintained apartment with fantastic views of san francisco bay and the city. the property is nicely appointed with everything you need. the host was attentive and available.  the host was at all times for any questions or concerns we had. we would highly recommend this property for those visiting san francisco desiring proximity to fisherman\\'s wharf and all of the other attractions.this is a great place to stay if you want to explore san fransisco! look out of one window and see alcatraz and then turn and see coit tower from the other! sid is very attentive to our needs. it has been  pleasure to be here. you are close to lots of attractions and all buses, trams and public transport stop within a block too. we have walked  and pedalled our feet off, but seen a lot! recommend pat\\'s cafe for breakfast and amelie\\'s on polk for a glass of wine or two! biking the golden gate was great fun and rewarded by an excellent meal and relax at bar bocce.if there were 10 stars, i would give to sid. we had great experience staying at sid\\'s penthouse. it was very clean and has everything we need. sharing bathroom with other guests is not a problem at all. i would definitely stay here again when i visit sf next time. this was my first time using airbnb and i\\'m delighted to say that everything turned out to be perfect- start to finish!\\nalthough sid was out of town, he made sure  the gracious annegret was there to make sure all was in order. sid was very friendly and helpful via email and text- always available.\\nthe penthouse was well-appointed and comfortable, a true home away from home. my room was clean and neat, the bed very comfortable to come to after busy days. the location was perfect!\\ni couldn\\'t have asked for a more unique way to experience sfo for the very first time. thank you so very much!sid was an amazing host and an all around awesome guy to hang out with! the room was perfect, clean, and the view from his penthouse was nothing short of amazing. i can\\'t recommend a better place to stay in san francisco!sid\\'s place was wonderful, with fantastic views and a large and comfortable room. i am very jealous of his workspace there, too. i didn\\'t meet him, but his property manager was very communicative and helpful. she made every effort to make me feel at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy only issue was with connecting to the wifi. at the time of my visit, sid had a secure setup which meant he had to whitelist my laptop and phone remotely. since he was in a different timezone, i was unable to access the internet immediately when i needed it, but only had to wait until the following morning. he was apologetic and it was no big deal in an otherwise perfect place to explore sf. his communication was generally excellent.sid\\'s apartment is absolute luxury. amazing location with an incredible view from your bed and throughout rest of the apartment. i worked from the lounge room during the day and had breathtaking views over the bay. sid stocked the house with coconut water and other supplies which was a fantastic touch. highly recommend!!we had a lovely stay in san francisco. sid was a great host and made everything very easy. communication beforehand was super easy and he even picked us up from the airport, which was just great after the long flight. the room and the whole apartment was very nice and had a great location to explore the city. sid and marie have been very welcoming. i can highly recommend staying with them. we had an amazing stay. sid was extremely helpful and his place had amazing views. great people. i highly recommend. dear sid and marie, thank you for bing great hosts for us during our stay in sf. this was first time using airbnb but definitely not the last! we appreciated you fine balance between being social and helpful when needed and giving us the privacy we also needed.  you have a fantastic apartment with great location and superb view. that you also keep it super clean and organized makes it even better. thanks to you both and hope to see you soon again :-)couldn\\'t have asked for a better experience - perfect location, great host, and the place matched the pics on the profile.\\r\\n\\r\\nplan on coming back to sf soon and hope to stay here again.sid was an awesome host who definitely went above and beyond! sid certainly didn\\'t have to do this but he gave me a ride when i first arrived to sf which made things easier for me. he gave me a lot of great tips on visiting sf. the listing was accurate. sid had a great place with spectacular views in a nice neighborhood close to a lot of sf destinations. i will definitely stay here again.sid and marie were terrific hosts for us on our 4 day visit last weekend.  we really wanted to be right where they are, at the edge of russian hill, the marina/chrissy field areas, and fisherman\\'s wharf - just blocks from the f-line and 2 cable cars so that we could get all over the city quickly.  the room and bath within their penthouse apartment is just right for the two of us and they made us feel very welcome in their home in every way.  they were very considerate given the more intimate situation of being within someone\\'s home with them and left us wanting nothing for our stay, including lots of information about the local area before we arrived and guidebooks and more information once we arrived.  we really enjoyed their company and would absolutely stay here again if our travels brought us out this way again.sid and his wife, marie, were incredibly welcoming. they even offered to pick me up from and take me to the airport. the apartment was conveniently located and beautiful with amazing views of the bay. i honestly felt like i was staying with friends! as per my previous review: awesome! sid you are the bestwhat a fantastic experience it was staying with sid in san francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nnot only was he extremely hospitable, the apartment was everything we had hoped it would be from the listing description. as an added bonus, sid\\'s recommendations for both food and attractions around the area were always spot on. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe will definitely be coming back and would recommend staying with sid to anyone considering a stop in san fran - you won\\'t regret it! i cannot thank sid and marie enough for the hospitality and experience they provided me. i really appreciated the fact that sid was able to pick me up and drop me off at the airport. his home is in a perfect location, just a small walk away from fisherman\\'s wharf. the view from his home overlooking the area is amazing.  their fridge is filled with a variety of foods, which guests are more than welcome to enjoy. sid always checked in with me during my stay to ensure everything was going okay and if there was anything he could help with, his recommendations of things to do and areas to visit were spot on. i will definitely stay with sid if i visit the area again. having read some of the other reviews, i\\'m not sure there\\'s much else i can add here. sid and marie are absolutely outstanding hosts; the apartment is in a great location and it has a breathtaking view over the bay. i would recommend this listing in a heartbeat to anyone looking for a room in san francisco!\\r\\n\\r\\np.s.: if you like chocolate, ghirardelli\\'s is just a couple of blocks away...amazing airb&b experience.  \\nthe accommodations were very clean, beds were comfortable, and apartment as described.  close to everything, excellent location.\\nsid & marie went way beyond expectations in every way to make our stay comfortable and memorable.\\nincluding: transport to & from airport, well stocked refrigerator, host visitor guide, excellent communication before & during trip, and they anticipated everything before we even knew that we needed it.\\nif you are traveling to sanfran for business or pleasure, this is the place to stay.  the view was amazing.sid is an amazing guy and this place is incredible. i had a relatively longer stay and felt fully at home. the room was well furnished and very clean and sid was very proactive in making sure i was comfortable. highly recommend staying with sid and marie - you\\'ll get more than just a place to stay.sid and marie were great hosts, staying at their place was a great experience. the location is perfect and the view from the apartment is superb. i highly recommend.sid and his wife were great hosts! great apartment with fantastic views!! would love to come back and highly recommended. sid is a great host, the room was great too and the downtown location enabled us to have a great time in frisco ! would defiantly recommend this as a great place to stay in san francisco. both sid and his wife marie have been great hosts right from picking me up from the airport to providing 5 star accommodation. plus offering helpfull advice on what to see and do in the city. the location is pretty awesome to with views of alcatraz and the bay. plus pier 39 is just a short walk away.  i will defiantly re-visit. thanks again sid & mariesid\\'s apartment was amazing! we had a great time in sf and part of this was because we chose sid\\'s residence. the location is perfect with a full view of the bay and it takes us only five minutes to fisherman\\'s wharf and ten to fifteen minutes to chinatown. sid also made great suggestions about where to have fun and enjoy great food. the other guests in the house were nice and friendly, too. i\\'ll definitely recommend this house to everyone who wants to have a fantastic time in sf. first, sid\\'s place is fabulous! it looks just like the pictures, but the pictures don\\'t really do it justice. the views are phenomenal, and there are so many windows and so much light! the location is super convenient; it\\'s walking distance to fisherman\\'s wharf, pier 39, chinatown, lombard st, coit tower. the apartment itself is well appointed; there\\'s all the toiletries you need in the bathroom, and everything you need to cook in the kitchen if you\\'re so inclined.\\n\\nunfortunately, i didn\\'t get to meet sid because he was out of the country, but he was so accessible and responsive to his emails. and annagret is amazing - super nice and super helpful. i can\\'t say enough how much i enjoyed my stay. it was my first airbnb experience and i don\\'t know that it gets much better than this. staying in sid\\'s condo was a wonderful experience. i would have rented it for the views alone. the place was spotlessly clean, the bed very comfortable, and with the ability to make coffee first thing in the morning, my wife and i could not have asked for better. unfortunately, we didn\\'t meet sid, as he was called out of town on business. he did arrange for a wonderful surrogate to let us in, give us keys, show us around the condo, and was available to answer questions during our stay. sid\\'s communication before, during and after our stay was easy and first rate as well. our roommates in their own rooms were nice, interesting people as well; one from england, one from sweden. were we to get to sfo again, i will look to sid\\'s as our first choice in accommodations. sid and marie are a very nice couple and wonderful hosts.\\nthey are really helpful and friendly. they worried about make our stay in sf the best possible and it was! \\nthe apartment is amazing and in a great location. the view is wonderful! \\neverything in the apartment was clean and comfortable.\\nit was a amazing experience. i really recommend this place.during my trip in sf, i\\'ve been telling everyone sid and marie are the most amazing hosts i\\'ve met. the apartment itself has amazing view and light. the neighborhood is nice and clean. the kitchen is full of food and beverages. the bathroom is super clean and tidy. the bedroom is connected to the balcony. i extremely enjoy my reading time there. the bed is so comfortable that it\\'s so hard for me to get up in the morning. sid has been keeping the entire apartment clean everyday. everything is simply amazing and wonderful. they taught me so much about how to be a host on airbnb from all the thoughtful details. i highly recommend you stay at his place when you\\'re in sf by yourself or with friends. the apartment was beautiful! perfect location. we rented a car and rarely even used it because we were able to walk everywhere. sid was an amazing host and his wife was extremely lovely. they are super quiet and very clean! the view from the living room and balcony are to die for. better view than any hotel in sf can offer. we walked to fisherman\\'s wharf, china town, little italy, ghirardelli square, the boat dock to alcatraz, lombard street, patti is an excellent host for my first stay at airbnb, his house is clean, interesting and it\\'s in a good location. i highly rocomand this place! patti also offers many food and drink (lots of wine) for us, that was kinda suprising and very impressive! it\\'s also a unique place that there are many art pieces and books! patti and rob\\'s place was perfect!\\r\\n\\r\\nmy boyfriend and i live around the corner, so when his parents, sister, and 20-month old nephew were in town for his dad\\'s 60th birthday, we booked this place for a night so everyone could spend some time together in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s always a little nerve-wracking booking places for (other people\\'s) family, but this worked out perfectly!\\r\\n\\r\\nmy boyfriend\\'s family was thrilled with the space (his mom said it would\\'ve been her \"dream apartment\" when she lived in sf), and commented on how much they loved the decor and the location. everything was very neat and clean, and since our group had a toddler, it was great being in a space that was already set up for kids (from the crib, to the kid\\'s chair, to the gate across the stairs).\\r\\n\\r\\nthings we were able to use were very neatly labeled, and they were very generous with their kitchen supplies, and even wine and spirits. everything was well-stocked, so we were able to drop by bi-rite grocery around the corner and then make dinner for everyone without any hiccups.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had perfect timing -- dolores park had just reopened after its lengthy closure for upgrades, and from the top of the hill we could see the fireworks and bay bridge lights go back up downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nif you\\'re visiting san francisco, the location is amazing: next to dolores park, just blocks from bart and muni, and right in the middle of a ton of great restaurants and stores.\\r\\n\\r\\nfactoring in cleaning fees, it was a bit pricey for a one-night stay, but i realized later that this was during the initial super bowl events in sf, so that\\'s not surprising.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d definitely recommend patti and rob\\'s place, especially if you\\'re traveling with family!rob & patti\\'s place is nothing but amazing and they were exceptional hosts. they were quick with responses and made sure we had an enjoyable stay - from a customized welcome note, complimentary drinks, and full access to everything that came with the place! the flat itself is unique with a welcoming feel and the location is unbeatable as it is steps away from dolores park. the private patio and jacuzzi also added a nice touch to our stay (plus extra towels were provided!) i would without a doubt stay here next visit and i cannot wait for that opportunity. don\\'t think twice when this flat is available for your visit.the host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.thanks patti and rob.  we were made to feel very welcome and appreciated all of the extra special touches.  the location was amazing - very central and easy to get around. we had a fantastic time! thanks again.awesome location, amazing apartment, generous host. make sure you acknowledge the sleeping arrangements as described: one double bed, one single bed, one inflatable. would be a great place for families esp with sf\\'s best park across the street.the room was great, it fitted all of our needs and the area is super fun, it\\'s right in the middle of everything- park and great food. we booked it really last minute and spencer was amazing with communication. thanks for making our san francisco pit stop run smoothly.the host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.first of all the location was great and walking distance to marina and ghiradelli.  the place has lots of potential but we were disappointed that the place did not meet what was advertised.  we selected this location vs others because it asterisked a non shared garage.  instead last min he stated it wasn\\'t avail. parking is a challenge in the marina and it was inconvenient. it required us placing the car in the garage on occasion.  after much back a forth, ben discounted $268. although the original we agreed on $331.\\r\\n\\r\\na few days before our trip, ben stated he wish to mail the keys to us even though it was advertised that a lock box will be available to make check in easy. eventually he agreed to have it in a lockbox after i pointed out what was advertised.\\r\\n\\r\\npros\\r\\ngreat location\\r\\nchildren friendly -toys, books, crib, child locks\\r\\nwell stocked -quality cookware, coffee machine, spices\\r\\ngreat backyard \\r\\n\\r\\ncons\\r\\n-tub could have been cleaner and the shower curtain was dirty. we ended up cleaning so we could wash the kids\\r\\n-lock box (see above)\\r\\n-parking (see above)\\r\\n-resolution took lots of back and forth\\r\\n-lamps and tv didn\\'t work in master bedroom because outlet didn\\'t work\\r\\n-it didn\\'t meet advertisement in multiple front\\r\\n-clothes left in dryer\\r\\n\\r\\nwould i reserve here again? nowe had a fantastic stay in this house. the location couldn\\'t be better with bus right outside in to town, walking distance to fisherman\\'s wharf and lots of other attractions. we also enjoyed the local restaurants and playground, and the supermarket was close. the best thing for our 2 and 3 year old was definitely all the amazing toys available in the house. they barely wanted to leave the house! the garden is very big with a trampoline and with gorgeous sunny weather we spent a fair bit of time there. we had a wonderful stay and felt the house was perfect for two families for the week we stayed. we had a wonderful stay.  the house was in a great location walkable to many of san francisco attractions and public transportation that picks up on the same block.  beds were comfortable and the house was spacious, and clean, but be aware, your 3 year old might not want to leave the house when they realize all the toys that are there!!! the garage was large enough to fit our rental mini van, although a tight, it still fit!  ben and sarah are great host, and leave great suggestions on places to eat and things to do.  thanks again!!sarah and ben were extremely accommodating to our team and our last minute booking request. they are both very responsive and made sure that everything worked out for us. the team loved the location of their home and there was plenty of space. would definitely stay here again! the reservation was canceled 10 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.i am sorry i cannot recommend mr singh, please contact airbnb for further details. naveen, his family and friends, and the apt were exactly what we needed to complete a wonderful experience in san francisco. they were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful. \\r\\nif you need a well located apartment, great private room and bathroom, and a friendly host, you have to look no further. highly recommended.it was perfect.\\r\\ngreat hosts, great location.  room was very private. naveen was a great host sturing my stay, and always helpful with towels, places i could go to,etc. the room was neat with a brand new bathroom. very good central location if you want to hang out for a shorter or longer period in san francisco. almost everything can be reached with a max 20 minute walk if you don\\'t feel like using plublic transportation. regards, jovii have really enjoyed my 18 night stay, the room was spacious and located at the back of the flat therefore you could hardly hear any traffic!\\r\\nthe flat itself is indeed centrally located with a 20 minute walk to the city.the stay was truly amazing and here is why. firstly the place is very nice and very clean. i am one of those people who are very picky when it comes to the matter of cleanliness. however, there was not a single thing to complain about. i stayed in 4-star intercontinental hotel a few days before my stay in naveen\\'s place and comparing the two i have to say naveen\\'s place is much nicer. you get a personal washroom that itself is very nice clean and fancy. you also get a private access to the roof that has some really awesome views including the view of the golden gate. naveen himself is an extremely friendly and nice host. his only rule was \"do whatever you want as if it was your home\". i indeed felt like i was at home.\\r\\nin addition to that, the place is very quiet and located in a very good neighborhood. you have lots of restaurants and grocery shops around you and all the major attractions are within a walking distance. \\r\\noverall i was very pleased with my stay and i am sure that i will be returning to naveen whenever i come back to san francisco. in the middle of nob hill, very conveniently located to restaurants, shops, and cable cars, this beautiful apartment is quiet and comfortable. the host, naveen, is a world-traveler with a wealth of stories and knowledge, and i was lucky enough to enjoy a french meal made by a couple visiting from the south of france. highly recommended.i would highly recommend staying at this nob hill apartment. the accommodations were perfect for me and my ten year-old daughter- very private, clean and safe.  the private,en suite bathroom had the best shower and the room even has access to a roof deck offering fantastic views of the area. the host, naveen, was gracious and interesting. i would highly recommend staying here!naveen greeted us very warmly. the house was nice and clean. we were however misled to believe that the house would be ours for our one day stay. instead there was another couple staying in another room and naveen lived in another. perhaps it was the wording of the description that led to the confusion. had we known we may have chosen another place. having said that our room was upscale and included an upgraded bathroom with all the amenities. the shower in particular was excellent. overall our stay was pleasant despite of the confusion. the flat was very beautiful indeed and in an excellent condition. we were welcomed with great hospitality. especially the central location of the flat made exploring sf very easy. but, however, the room was a different one without the private but a shared bathroom and was facing the street. apart from that wie had a splendid stay.naveen was a very nice host with a very beautiful apartment. we had a great time and he offered his expertise on the restaurants near by.awesome , naveen is the best host ..always ready to help \\nthe room is specious and well furnished ..suitable for business traveller naveen welcomed us and was very friendly. we enjoyed our 3-day stay in the nob hill area very much. the apartment was very comfortable. we enjoyed the private master bedroom and bathroom and used the access to the rooftop and couple times.  the view of the golden gate bridge was a real treat.naveen was a gracious host and has a great apartment in a great part of town. easy to walk to so many places but since its on the hill (a big hill) you will wan to uber back. i met two couples too as they share the living/kitchen area - the true airbnb experience - you will enjoy the room and the company.  naveem made us feel very welcome and was particularly helpful with the parking - there wasn\\'t any space outside (and it would have only been for 2 hours) so he let us use his garage space.\\r\\nroom was just as described  with access to roof terrace which had great views of the city - shower was amazing!\\r\\nclose to restaurants, convenience stores and tram stop - short walk to union square. we also walked to fishermans wharf but wouldn\\'t recommend the walk back unless you like hills! we did it once but jumped the tram the 2nd time.\\r\\ni do feel we paid a bit over the odds for it even taking into account the locality.naveen was a very good host.  he provided suggestions for restaurants where the locals dine out and introduced us to a few new site seeing adventures.  overall, pleasant stay in san francisco at naveen\\'s place!best location with clean and tidy bed. view on the roof top is amazing, just pity that we didn\\'t have much time for it. nadeem himself is very responsive. he recommended us places to eat and fun, even prepared us a bottle of champagne as a gift for marriage. thank you naveen, it was such a pleasure to meet u!  naveen was helpful & the location was very good with easy access to all the desired locations, especially if you enjoy walking as i do. if not however, there is easy access to the cable car.i have to say big thank you to naveen. he has an amazing apartment. during our 3 days stay in san francisco we walked through pretty much the whole town and i must say that location cannot be better!\\n\\nyou get private access to roof top where you can spend evenings with a glass of wine overlooking whole city.\\n\\nnaveen has helped us a lot with parking and pretty late check-in.\\n\\nonce again, highly recommended!naveen\\'s place was easy to find and on a beautiful street on the cable car route.   the neighborhood was upscale, and within two streets of a busy retail/restaurant district.  check in was convenient as the host welcomed us. he offered us a fresh cup of tea and showed us around the place.  the room was very nice, exactly as pictured, and the bathroom and shower were fantastic.  the entire place appeared to have been recently remodeled.  the queen size bed was very comfortable.  naveen spent time giving us information about local restaurants and bars.  we stayed only one night, but noticed that naveen had a maid come to clean the entire place on the day that we left.  at the end of our stay, he was very flexible with our check out time, and all in all it was a great experience.  we would be happy to stay again.  awesome place to stay ! location was perfect in the middle of everything. would definitely stay here again! loved naveen\\'s place! i had a quiet room and my own bath with a large, new rain shower. common space was clean and welcoming and naveen was kind enough to share a few snacks as well!great place, great location.  host was very accommodating and responsive.  can\\'t ask for a better place to stay in san francisco.  view from the rooftop is beautiful.  apartment and room were very clean!great neighborhood with a brigde view from the roof. 20min walking distance to union square. had no problem during 1 week stay. house was stylish and clean. naveen is a friendly guy whom i was glad to meet.my partner and i really enjoyed our stay at naveen\\'s. he was extremely laid back and friendly. one night he even offered us some of his home cooked meal! the room was comfortable and the shower was excellent! great location right on hyde street. nook cafe on corner was delicious. thank you naveen for having us!the room is as good as advertised - large bed with very nice private bathroom.  there is also a private doorway in the room leading to stairs which take you to the rooftop - this provides excellent views of the city and the golden gate bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe host, naveen, was very welcoming & friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  he ensured we could use the entire living space (e.g. kitchen, living room, etc) as we wished and provided recommendations of restaurants in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only negative feedback i have about the place is the noise.  there is a cable car that periodically passes right by the place and you can clearly hear when it rings its bell.  there was an additional airbnb couple staying in an adjacent room who were a bit noisy at times as well.  also, the host seems to be a very busy man as his phone was ringing late into the night (i was woken up several times around 11:30 pm from the phone ringing and the host talking in the other room).\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all i would recommend this place to a friend.  you get a large, clean, comfortable room in a nice neighborhood with lots to do in the immediate area for a reasonable price.naveen was a 5/5 host! would definitely recommend him to other traveller! he went out of his way to give an awesome experience at his apartment!naveen is awesome host, i had a wonderful time. place is as described.  great neighborhood with restaurants and transportation.naveen met us when we arrived and was quite welcoming. the apartment was very similar to the photographs.  (there were often strong cooking smells from the kitchen which i could have done without). the steep stairs to the roof top deck were dirty with cans and cigarette butts but the view was spectacular. the neighboring apartment was noisy with a party one night. the neighborhood offered a great location for visiting san francisco. while the corner was quite busy and noisy with traffic and cable cars but had a \\'neighborhood feel\\'.  if you plan to drive however, parking is very difficult. there is limited on street parking and public garages are nearly non-existent.  close to many restaurants, bars and cafes.  naveen and his nephew mike were fantastic hosts. not only knowledgable about the area but made me feel immediately welcome when i came into their home. \\nmy conference schedule was very busy and they were on hand at any time just for a chat or help if i needed it. would definitely recommend. george  i am glad i chose naveen\\'s airbnb! coudn\\'t have got a better welcome and stay so far away from home. the listing description was perfect. the neighborhood was very friendly. the flat is right in the middle of san fransisco with easy access to everything. the room was large with a private bathroom and the view from the roof included the golden gate bridge. naveen welcomed us on our arrival and gave us great recommendations about where to go and where to eatthis place is absolutely amazing. the room is super spacious and it comes with a private bathroom is super luxurious (waterfall shower and everything). naveen is a super nice host and is willing to tell you all about the city. his nephew was also very friendly! the location is also very convenient. close to everything and there is even a cable car stop right in front of the house. would definitely stay here again! this is a lovely apartment in a great neighbourhood, pretty much walking distance to everything. there are grocery stores down the street and plenty of restaurants near by. naveen greeted us at the apartment and gave us some info (incl. a map) on sf. unfortunately, we were given the wrong room initially; we had booked the larger room with a private bathroom and, after some discussion, we were moved to the correct room on the second day. we later found that this is a common occurrence (ie. double booking rooms). the host\\'s disorganization and naivety led to further issues. a movie shoot that was supposed to occur in one room ended up taking over the entire apartment, forcing us out of our space for the whole day. though naveen was apologetic, this was inconvenient and disappointing. there\\'s a lack of clear house rules regarding cleaning up after yourself, noise late at night, etc. the shared spaces were also messy and cluttered. this being said, the host\\'s nephew and his girlfriend (who also live in the apt) were very helpful and fun to chat with. they have a really well-behaved puppy as well. there\\'s a rooftop patio shared with the rest of the building, which has great views but is overrun with beer cans and dog poop. we had a great stay in sf but we could have done without the complications of this apt. naveen and his nephew have been really good hosts! super friendly and made sure that i felt at home. naveen would always offer to make tea/breakfast whenever we were both at home. location is great too, with easy access to most places either via uber or public transport. bed was comfy and the room was clean and just the right size. would definitely come back to stay again :) the location was great , naveen was a great host. it has a great rooftop with great view. i recommend this place to anyone that wants to get a san francisco experience. the troley is right outside the door too which was awesome . thank you naveen naveen was flexible with our check in and response time was great and very helpful with check in etc. the rooms were clean and pretty comfortable. the host canceled this reservation 102 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.agnes is an amazing host, she went out of her way to make sure my aircrew new hires were welcomed into her home as friends- she even extended our stay at the last moment to accomodate us!  the house is stunning and my new hires didn\\'t want to leave!  \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you agnes, we love your gorgeous home!  lovely experience, thank you!my employee coley had this to say about her stay in agnes\\' home; \\r\\n\\r\\n\"agnes\\'s place is like a home away from home. i\\'ve never felt intrusive or out of place here, and it\\'s so wonderful and relaxing after long bits of traveling, hoping from one place to another. this time, i had the pleasure of meeting agnes and her husband and i felt instantly at ease. the ferrero roche chocolates in the kitchen upon check in are absolutely delightful, too! not to mention that the house is right around the corner from the muni stop and a zipcar lot, and is only 2 to three blocks from bart. it\\'s the perfect retreat in the center of all the action, just steps away from great food, boutiques, and street art. i\\'d recommend agnes any day. \"this house is so amazing! lots of charm, character, and space. lots of things to do, eat, and see as you\\'re in a central location (mission district). there\\'s ample room, two beautiful courtyard/gardens, and a hot tub! for being in such a busy area of town, this house provides the respite you need to unwind. will definitely consider renting again next time i\\'m in sf with a group.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks so much agnes!gorgeous is the key word! we were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a wonderful book of agnes restaurant reviews, which we stuck to completely. the house had everything we could ask for and more. great, fun area. will definitely stay there again. we enjoyed everything about our entire stay .  the house is in a great location .  agnes left a list of  restaurants within walking distance   was very helpful .  thanks for having a computer as well as wi-fi . if we are able to visit san francisco again will stay here again . \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ni cannot express how wonderful this home was or how accommodating agnes is... i, along with four colleagues, visited for a week and could not have been happier with the accommodations. we were in town for a conference at the moscone center and were beyond pleased that the house was a mere five minute walk from the bart. furthermore, we were thrilled to find out that the mission--the neighborhood where the house is located--is arguably the epicenter of the eating/drinking scene in san francisco... so many wonderfully unique and delicious eateries and bars. \\r\\n\\r\\nalthough you\\'re in the heart of the city, you wouldn\\'t need to leave the house if you didn\\'t want to. the home is a short walk from numerous bodegas and groceries and the surround sound, multiple patios/courtyards, patio heaters, and open first floor make the property ideal for just relaxing or hosting a small group of traveling companions. \\r\\n\\r\\nas an added benefit, agnes and her husband are incredibly responsive and accommodating. it literally felt like we borrowed a close relative\\'s home for the week. all of the many amenities were clearly labeled for use, and the hosts even left a bound book of their favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. if you\\'re considering staying at the marriot--or the westin, for that matter--don\\'t. you won\\'t be sorry. we weren\\'t, at least. we stayed her for five nights and could not have imagined it going better. \\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, the house is fantastic. we had 6 people (two couples and two singles) and there was plenty of room to spare. the pictures do not do it justice. three things we loved most were the tempurpedic bed in the master bedroom, the enormous master bath with a great jacuzzi tub, and the private backyard complete with hot tub. \\r\\n\\r\\nalso, if you are a music junkie (like we are) you\\'ll dig the fantastic definitive speakers (one pair in the living room and one pair in the office next to the kitchen) as well as a full-house sound system connected to a massive music library fed via a central server. there\\'s also a couple of projection screens if you\\'re into movies, but we didn\\'t try them. \\r\\n\\r\\nsecond, the neighborhood was awesome. we were so much better off staying in a residential neighborhood compared to where most hotels are in downtown, nob hill, near fisherman\\'s wharf, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nfinally, there were so many special little touches. for example, agnes left chocolates on everyone\\'s pillows. she left out bottles of wine for us. bed linens and towels were all great quality. the house had little notes everywhere to take out the guesswork of figuring out how to operate things. soap, toothpaste, shampoo -- all there. i had forgotten my toothbrush and after six hours of meetings and seven hours of travel i was bumming thinking i\\'d have to go back out and buy one right after arriving. turned out there was a new toothbrush left out in the bathroom in case anyone forgot theirs. \\r\\n\\r\\nthis will be the first place i check on all future trips to san francisco. the house is amazing, the pictures don\\'t do it justice. it is huge and everything you would ever need/want is waiting for you. from a list of restaurants walking distance from the house, to a bottle of wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location is great for all ages, walking distance to many amazing restaurants, shops and bars. - we wish we had stayed longer to try them all.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe communication from agnes throughout the whole stay was perfect, from getting into the house at the start of our stay to any questions we had throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe couldn\\'t have been happier and will only be staying in san francisco again if this house is available, thanks agnes!agnes was a fantastic host. i recently had my family visiting me for about 10 days. had them stay at her gorgeous and charming home in the mission. can\\'t say enough good things about the home itself. but i will say that i lost track of the number of times my family changed their plans around and i had to email agnes to see if it was ok. and every time she was very fast with her response, and very accommodating. things couldn\\'t have gone more smoothly. big thanks to her.the house is simply amazing. not only is it huge but also has a great location. the porch and the hot tub just add to this great stay. agnes was also most helpful and easy to reach with questions. great house, great location, great host. couldn´t ask for more while staying with friends and family for a week in sf.agnes place is really awesome. we stayed there with colleagues and we really enjoyed it. this is the perfect place to stay with friends and family and to discover and enjoy san francisco. agnes is a host that takes care of her guests and the house offers everything you need. we will definitely stay there again! we had a wonderful stay at agne\\'s property at the beginning of august.  she is communicative and extremely thoughtful, the best host one can hope for.\\r\\n\\r\\nproperty: what you see in the pictures is what you get.  the home is very clean and organized.  as other guests had commented, agnes left thoughtful notes throughout the house to explain how things work.  i emailed a question about the sound system, agnes provided very detailed instructions back promptly.  \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d like to add that the house has a very charming inner garden with lemon trees and banana tree as well as a courtyard garden in the front.  another huge bonus is the kitchen, which is well stocked with everything.  even though we didn\\'t do any major cooking during our stay, it was very pleasant to have breakfast, coffee or tea in the morning while looking out the french doors into the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally, as i was traveling with 2 kids, it was also super convenient that the house\\'s washer and dryer were just next to the master bedroom!  i wish i had that setup in my own house!\\r\\n\\r\\nagnes: i really appreciate her thoughtfulness!  upon hearing that i have a 3-year old, she voluntarily provided a pack n\\' play without me asking.  she also provided a foldout mattress without me asking which proved useful for my 9-year old to sleep on.  from these gestures, i could feel she is a very kind and warm individual.  thumbs up!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a great time at agnes apartment. the location is fabulous with the bart stop two blocks away. she also provided us with lots of useful information about what to see and do. her sound and video systems are fantastic. we especially enjoyed being walking distance to tartine for breakfast. everyone wants to stay there again on our next visit to the city by the bay. \\r\\nwe plan to return. we loved it! the location was perfect for us to easily get downtown, the house was amazing, and our host absolutely delightful.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had business downtown and made the commute across an entire work week using uber. plenty of coffee shops and restaurants were within walking distance while we were at home.\\r\\n\\r\\ni think what we enjoyed most was how comfortable and stylish the entire house was. it also had an incredible mix of old and new, with cutting edge technology that was tastefully hidden yet easily discoverable.\\r\\n\\r\\nagnes was such a thoughtful host. we enjoyed our bottle of wine that was waiting for us when we arrived. she was always responsive to questions (texting was great!) and concerned about ensuring our needs were meet.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis was also a perfect place for a corporate team (we were). we intend to make this our base of operations on our other visits.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you, agnes!agnes is possible the best airbnb host i have ever experienced. she was on top of all of my questions and requests. the house is comfortable and very clean. having two patios made taking advantage of the beautiful sunny days we got during our visit. we grilled, cooked up a storm in the kitchen, had some family over for dinner around the large dining room table, and enjoyed a bubble bath in the huge master bathroom. \\r\\nthe house is central! we went to different amazing restaurants and cafes every single day. seriously, it was awesome! great communication with agnes,  house was perfect for our needs,  it was in a great location, was quiet and very comfortable. agnes is a great host and did all she could to ensure we had a great stay.\\r\\nneilagnes has a fantastic house. instructions were really accurate and all the house is full of useful signs which make your stay much easier.\\r\\nwe feel like home.agnes was extremely communicative prior to our stay to provide us with all the details necessary for  an easy check in, and greeted us upon our arrival. the property is as described and has all of the conveniences of home, and more! agnes provided maps, a directory of local restaurants with a brief review of each, and helpful notes throughout the house. the location is great location with easy access to many attractions. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe care and detail put into the property is clearly evident and for the few questions we had, agnes was readily available to answer them. we have stayed at several airbnb properties and this was among the best. i highly recommend this property and would definitely stay here again.this is the nicest airbnb experience i have had to date. the house is situated behind a row of apartments (so no street noise) in a nice section of the mission district and there is even a little farm belonging to a neighbor in back with sheep and chickens (but we didn\\'t hear them in the morning)! the house is beautifully furnished with original art, carpets, books and even some silver. it does not look like an apartment made for renting, but really a beautiful home. within walking distance, there are some great restaurants from the top 100 list in san francisco like range. i would definitely return next time i visit the city.our stay was absolutely perfect!!! the house was huge, clean, gorgeous, and very comfortable. also very close to food, drinks, site seeing (central for walking tours through mission, castro, hayes valley, haite st, gg park...), bart, etc. we couldn\\'t have been happier w the place and the value. agnes was great too. stay here!!!great house in very nice neiborhood! we had a very good time. we worked at the kitchen table with the doors to the patio open all day. the whole house is very clean and we could use everything! this with the good company of mr. pushek, the minute we met i was in love. we had great days together (i hope he miss me aswel) !! this house feld like home (only this was bigger and the weather more beautiful). thanks again for your hospitality! kind regards francahi agnes - you\\'re a great hostess!!  we really enjoyed our time in san francisco, and your house was a key part of that.  thanks for providing such a comfortable place for us and everything we needed.  thank you too for your flexibility in letting us check in a little early, and responding quickly to any inquiries we had - you\\'re awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe enjoyed eating at the monk\\'s kettle - great call.this home was perfect for our thanksgiving holiday.  we felt very \"at home\" here even though we were thousands of miles away.  the kitchen was large and had plenty of workspace and lots of natural light.  the artwork, décor and furnishings were truly lovely and very comfortable.   the outdoor patio/gardens were serene and very relaxing as well.  the pictures are accurate as to what the house is like and the music, television and sound systems were excellent (which you can\\'t see that in the pictures)!  beds were very comfortable and the house is set back off the street so it was relatively quiet.  of course you could hear the occasional siren but there were no loud bus noises or street noises at night.  location was outstanding - just a block or so to tartine bakery, bi-rite market and creamery and delfina\\'s restaurant to name only a few.  agnes made everything easy and quickly responded to all our questions - she\\'s wonderful.  i would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend staying in this gorgeous home away from home.    we had a terrific stay in this house and loved the area. agnes was a wonderful host and always responded quickly when we had a question. the pictures on the website are all accurate. the house is very tastefully decorated and extremely well equipped. we would happily stay here again when we are next in san francisco.the house felt homey (due to the way the furniture and decor was placed) and the surrounding neighborhood was really peaceful and quiet. it had an antique feeling to it and it makes you feel like you went in a time machine to the past. this house really lives up to it\\'s name as a \\'gorgeous san francisco home\\'.agnes was extremely accommodating and really good at communicating with us. you can tell there is a lot of attention to detail on her end. we\\'ve had a wonderful stay at her house, the beds are really comfortable and has very nice showers. i would definitely go back if i had the chance. 100% recommended! a lovely house - big, clean, beautifully located in a great neighbourhood, surrounded by stores, bars, restaurants, transport hubs - a great central base from which to explore sf. comfortable beds, nice showers, a ton of fresh towels, big tv, kitchen has everything you\\'ll need & more. agnes is helpful, responsive & accommodating - even left wine & chocolates there to greet us. miss the place already... we had a great stay at agnes\\'s home in the mission neighbourhood. big, clean lovely house. the pictures on the website are all accurate. agnes was really good at communicating with us, and she had some great suggestions for places to eat in the mission district, we got to try some of them! it was easy to get in to downtown sf using the muni. we would definitely stay ther again if we have the chance! \\nwe enjoyed this fantastisch house very much! after one year it felt like home. we worked at the kitchen table with the doors open. the neighboorhood is  friendly with a couple of nice restaurants. everything you need is availible in this beautifull house. after a hard day work it was so nice to be \\'home\\'! the beds are fantastic and i loved to have showers with the doors open. for me it was extra special because of mr pushek :-) it was love on first sight, the reunion was a pleasure! thanks agnes for letting us stay in your home!great location, wonderful house, awesome host! and a cool, chill cat. could ask for a better stay. agnieska was very communicative and quick to respond. the location was great and the house is an interesting and great place to use as home base in the city.my family really enjoyed staying at jose\\'s apartment. there has everything you need for daily life. i felt at my own home.it was very sweet that he provided host notes for us. jose introduced restaurants nearby and visiting place.  thanks, jose.the apartment was in a great location near a cable car stop. also close walking distances to many attractions, shops and restaurants. the apartment has amazing views of the bay bridge, a great roof top deck and was very clean. jose responded within minutes when we had questions during our stay. we had a really nice time. thank you. nice apartment, great view particularly from the roof deck. jose made sure everything was all set for us and was readily available for question.jose was very accommodating. our plans fell through to visit sonoma and jose made everything easy for us. highly recommend it was a very nice apartment and very comfortable. the view is really nice and it has a great location. the beds are soooo comfortable!! there is not a lot of space to put your things in the closets because there are full with stuff and if you are sensible to noise while you sleep, don\\'t sleep in the back bedrooms, the cable car is just down the window. jose was very nice and very responsive to all of our doubts. we had a very nice stay :)an enjoyable week spent here.  jose\\'s apartment was well located within walking distance of the city centre and close to transport links, bars and restaurants.  the apartment was spacious, well decorated and comfortable, with amazing view of the bay bridge and a fantastic shared roof terrace with breathtaking cityscape vistas.  jose had provided a helpful info pack and he dealt promptly to rectify a cleaning issue.  his updated website accurately represents the apartment.  the cupboards in the kitchen, ensuite bedroom, ensuite bathroom and the fridge were crammed with the host\\'s personal possessions, and we feel it would have been better to have more available dedicated space for use by guests staying longer than a couple of nights.  we had a great stay at jose\\'s apartments and enjoied the beautiful sunrises with the  view on the oakland bridge. \\r\\nthe apartments has all you need, including a massive television and an arcade table (good luck beating jose\\'s scores though). \\r\\ni had to communicate with jose a couple of times and he replied in a split second: very reliable. last minute booking due to cancellation of planned airbnb arrangement: at the end we are happy if the cancellation. this place is just awesome with an incredible view on baybridge and downtown. jose has been very helpful and we spend a great time in his superb place.we had a great week at jose’s apartment! his rapid response to any of questions or needs made us feel right at home. our accommodations were above our expectations. the 3 bedroom unit provided all that we needed; wi-fi, comfortable bedding, spacious units, guidebook of nearby restaurants and attractions. the master bedroom and its skyline view was a refreshing start to the morning. not to mention the grand view of the oakland bay bridge from the living room quarter was incredible to experience the shifts in the day. we enjoyed a few gaming sessions with our in home console that was provided and the rooftop view allowed for us to truly take in the sensational feel of the san franciscan lifestyle, with a slight peak of alcatraz, the jolly ring of the trolley and subtle horns of the neighboring boats. we were in heaven, often confirming to the members of our party that we had no desire to leave. we will certainly be interested in revisiting the area, as we were very pleased.i think the term \"super host\" is pushing it. my roommates and i would not recommend staying at jose\\'s place to anyone. we rented out jose\\'s place for a 6 week stay while being in town for work. my two roommates and i were extremely excited. we arrived at the apartment and the view was stunning, however the house smelled of rotted food. we opened the fridge to find old molded vegetables and rotting ground turkey. we opened up the freezer and it was fully packed with frozen items that had expired in 2013! when we went to dispose of these items we found that there was trash still in the kitchen trash can. it was disgusting and should have been taken care of before our arrival. \\n\\nthe biggest problem we had was the wifi/tv. in his listing he offers both of those things but they actually don\\'t work. day two of our stay we noticed that neither the wifi or tv worked so we contacted him asking if he could fix it only to get very rude responses such as \"you broke it, you fix it\". i had to contact airbnb to get some help because action was not being taken by him.  it took 5 weeks to finally get someone in to fix it. by that point he was on a boat sailing somewhere and wasn\\'t responding to the company he hired to have the wifi/tv fixed. yes, we went 6 weeks without wifi or tv which sounds petty but it put a damper on our social and work lives. \\n\\nin addition to the trash and wifi/tv a few cupboards are broken in the kitchen and every closet in the house is filled with miscellaneous items and clothing, not ideal for a 6 week stay. i\\'m sure we left that house in better condition than when we showed up. we stay in airbnbs frequently as we travel for work and i hope to never have an experience like this again. \\n\\n\\n\\nthe host canceled this reservation 21 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we felt welcomed, listing was accurate. matt was a terrific host, super responsive and willing to accommodate all of our questions and requests. the house was a fantastic experience for our guests and everyone loved both the decor and the vibe, a labor of love for sure. highly recommended!this could very well be the most incredible air bnb in the united (url hidden) joke!\\r\\n\\r\\ni booked for a group of 16, thinking it would add a unique element to our trip...and everyone was blown away. matt was an incredibly kind, and accessible host (when we asked for a tv to watch the playoffs, he set up a projector and giant screen for us). and the pictures are for real! there\\'s a amazing airstream trailer in the compound...a giant balcony space with incredible scenery...enough beds to sleep 16 comfortably...and something cool and interesting in every corner. \\r\\n\\r\\nbook this space! i promise the experience is worth every penny. you will never forget your stay at matt\\'s bohemian compound.this place is magical. a truly unique place in sf. tons of space and phenomenal art work every where. you feel like you have stepped into another world as soon as you enter. the sonos speakers everywhere are great for playing music. the big open shower is amazing. perfect location and the view can\\'t be beat!we had a good experience. the building was located in the general area we needed. the building is new and modern with 24 hour security at the front desk. the apartment has 3 bedrooms and the other 2 were occupied during our stay. our room was large and spacious with a locked door. the bed was comfortable and clean. the room has only a few amenities... a small tv (apple tv, no cable), a desk and chair. the big plus was the private bathroom that was large and modern. we did not meet miles but he was available via email or text. he was out of town and had his friend casey greet us. casey was very helpful in answering any questions and making suggestions. the room was a good value for the weekend versus nearby hotels.great view, clean apartment...host is amazing!!! will visit again , despite a medical emergency he kept in touch, thank you so much i stayed at

before arrival. this is an automated posting.the bnb was exactly as advertised with terrific views off the east-side of san francisco and the giants baseball park as well as clean and well-maintained. however, i never actually got to meet my host. with the exception of his roommate who gave me a key the first day, we were pretty independent.this apartment is awesome, there are nice view out of the window, you can see the sunrise in the morning, room is very clean, owner is very nice girl, you can find parking space on the street, this apartment is near wharf.miles was very welcoming! the room has a door with a lock that excludes it from the rest of the condo, making it feel like your own space. private bathroom was clean and the towels were fresh and clean as well. they even had mini bottles of shampoo and soap (but i had brought my own just in case). i would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a place to stay in soma. great location as it is near the caltrain station, at&t park and many places to eat and drink. the listing was great and exactly as described. very comfortable and spacious bedroom, and the connected private bathroom really made things feel great. miles was great and accommodating.this recently remodeled apartment is spacious, lovely & quiet and has been tastefully and carefully crafted to offer both comfort and a high-end living experience.  it was an honor to be the first-ever guest to book this place through air bnb and stephanie went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  the fridge was stocked with breakfast goodies (from tartine, no less! (url hidden) and there were gorgeous fresh flowers in every room.  \\r\\n\\r\\nas magnificent as the apartment, itself, was, the location was even better!  (only a half block off valenia.)  you get the best of the mission right at your doorstep but the bedrooms are at the rear and as quiet as could be.   this stay was my best  air bnb experience to date.the apartment was super nice and clean and much larger than i even expected.  a nice welcome package of fruit and snacks was waiting for us.  the location is perfect for experiencing the energy of the mission.  i would definitely stay there again.  stephanie was very accommodating, helpful, communicative and prompt. the apartment was even better than the photos! a great location in the city and a very comfortable stay. stephanie\\'s apartment is the dream apartment.  the photos don\\'t do this place justice. the most comfortable beds and the best sheets ever, smelled like tide.  the neighborhood is terrific.  you can walk anywhere, great restaurants and parks out the front door.  stephanie was easy to communicate with.  i would absolutely stay here again and would highly recommend this pad.beautiful newly remodeled apt in mission, close to dolores park and a variety of restaurants and shops. the house was very nice and exceeded out expectations. we were welcomed with a fruit and chocolate basket and the owner gave us a bunch of restaurant recommendations. the apt is ideally located for all activities in the mission area and is close enough to bart and muni for citywide access.\\r\\nthe owner was in frequent contact over email/message and quickly resolved any issues (there weren\\'t much..mostly recommendations on what to do around mission)\\r\\noverall i highly recommend this place. its well worth it.this place is amazing. words could not describe the awesomeness that awaits if you book this place. my friends and i came in late sunday evening and could not asked for a better welcoming to sf. it is centrally located in the mission district, within walking distance of the famous dolores park and all the fun restaurants and hang-outs on valencia street. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe master bedroom and bathroom are luxurious and make you feel like you\\'re in your own spa. the other bedroom and bathroom were also recently renovated and awesome. this apartment is definitely designed with an open lay-out and friendly for hanging out. \\r\\n\\r\\nstephanie was amazing. she was responsive to texts before our arrival and made sure that were able to enter the apartment with no issue. we also are super grateful that we had 1 extra friend ask to stay a night and she was super accommodating. \\r\\n\\r\\ni honestly could not have asked for a better first airbnb experience. i would recommend this listing to any family and friends looking for an awesome apartment in sf!! can\\'t wait to go back myself. we had a wonderful stay at the full floor apartment! beautiful flat with lovely original details and thoughtful renovated throughout. could not be better, luxury apartment, better than 5 stars hotel in the heart of mission dolores, close to restaurants, transportation. an absolutely amazing first airbnb experience! i stayed here for 2 nights with my family of 6, and it was a beautiful experience. the house is spacious, with a mix of old and modern design done just perfectly, because it has only been renovated recently. stephanie was also gracious enough to leave us a basket of fruits and another of chocolates/tea/coffee, etc. which we really appreciated. everything you can think of, this apartment offers - from shampoo to extra toothbrushes, to ultra-fast internet to a coffee french press. the location was also perfect, and there are many restaurants close by. i highly recommend you stay here!in two words, absolutely amazing! \\r\\nthis 2bedroom, 2.5bath is way more than we expected. from the neighborhood with fine dinning and great pubs all around, to the classic and mission decor. what a fab space! stephanie welcomed us when we entered with a warm hug and offered her time if we needed anything. she then told us  of a few places to grab a bite for the night. as we walked upstairs to our private condo, we were just amazed. beauty everywhere. huge kitchen, amazing dinning room, a chandelier  i need to look for my home! the beds are comfortable, everything sparkling clean, kitchen made for cooking. it was a divine experience that we won\\'t forget anytime soon. i give this space a 5* easily and will be recommending it to friends! \\r\\nthanks stephanie we will be back! \\r\\njonathan and jaycee barth we stayed at stephanie and jeff\\'s apartment during early october. we were a group of five adults and one toddler and found that there was lots of space and privacy for everyone. the apartment was fantastic! very clean, bright, serene and comfortable. you can tell that the apartment is very well taken care of. stephanie and jeff made us feel very welcome, with some fresh fruit in the fridge and snacks on the counter. and they thoughtfully had a bag of tasty coffee waiting for us, with a new bottle of cream in the fridge!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe beds were comfortable, with high-quality linens and pillows. and the bedrooms are beautifully sunlit, and you won\\'t hear any street noise at all. there was some street noise in the front room where one person slept on the pullout sofa, but she said it wasn\\'t too bad. \\r\\n \\r\\nthe location was very convenient for us. there were many good places to eat within a couple minutes\\' walk, including a personal favourite of ours - tartine. there were some cute shops as well for the shoppers in our group. there was a playground for our toddler on valencia, about 5 minutes away, and we all enjoyed walking around delores park. stephanie and jeff have a nicely thought-out and organized binder with recommendations, reviews, menus, etc. for all the local eateries and attractions, which was very helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a rental car for our large-ish group, and there was a secured parking garage about a block away that we used on stephanie\\'s recommendation. it cost $22 a night to park there, but that\\'s comparable to (if not less than) what you\\'d pay at a hotel for parking so no big deal to us. there was a car share nearby as well, which we would have used if were were a smaller group or didn\\'t need to use a car seat.\\r\\n\\r\\noverall, we were extremely happy with the experience, and we\\'d gladly stay there again the next time we\\'re in san francisco!this place is beautiful and in such a great neighborhood. plus, the space is very big and we never felt cramped even when we had guests come over for dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nbeds were super comfortable, all memory foam mattresses with soft sheets. the bathroom and shower in the master bedroom is super luxurious and tons of space in the closet. second bedroom also has it\\'s own bathroom but must be shared with anyone who is staying on the couch. kitchen has all high-end appliances.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly downside was that it was a bit dusty in some places.stunning place and incredible host! enjoyed every minute of my experience in this modern classic san francisco home ;-) extremely nice home in san francisco mission district.  very well kept with a high-end, modern kitchen.  walking distance to plenty of restaurants.  much more economical than multiple hotel rooms in sfo.i\\'ve stayed at many airbnb listings before and have to say stephanie\\'s apartment has been the best. stephanie was excellent at communicating throughout my stay. it was extremely clean, modern, and comfortable for my family and i. the kitchen is a dream come true and the bedrooms are in the back so it\\'s really quiet at night. a little street noise for whoever gets to sleep on the pullout couch but not bad at all. i also loved that everything is walking distance (restaurants, groceries, etc.) my family and i really enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon!i booked this for my executives, and they were delighted.  the place was great.  the chef\\'s kitchen was amazing, the location was absolutely incredible, and the beds were very comfy.  thank you, stephanie for a great stay!stephanie was an awesome host! she gave really good and clear instructions; left out a basket with fruits and tasty snacks for us; and was totally cool when i accidentally broke a water glass. the listing itself is amazing, spacious, comfortable, absolutely gorgeous and perfectly located in the mission. possibly my best airbnb experience yet!stephanie was great and very helpful.  the apartment was absolutely beautiful and by far the nicest place i\\'ve stayed in sf.  i\\'ll definitely be checking if this apartment is available next time i come!stephanie was extremely easy to communicate with and her home is absolutely gorgeous. very comfortable, clean, homey and in a great part of town! would definitely stay with her again. perfect location and super nice, upgraded, clean and comfortable place.  the bedding and interior were also very clean.  stephanie made it easy to communicate and confirm and offered a exceptional welcome basket!very good location!very good neirbourhood! thank you, naveen!! naveen\\'s friend, pj  was a lovely host. we met naveen on our last night, and he was also very nice. the room and bathroom were clean and it\\'s a nice location.\\r\\nwhen we come back to san fran we will likely try to stay here again! also, this morning when we were leaving i couldn\\'t find the blow dryer... i felt so bad waking pj up but he got it for me and was so nice about it!!great location, great host! naveen was great! greeted us in the morning and made us feel welcomed in his home. his apartment is in a convenient spot within san francisco with plenty of delicious restaurants, coffee shops, and access to transportation. i was pleasantly surprised with my first booking on airbnb.  naveen and pj sent me codes for free uber rides to and from the airport.  the place is in a very nice location that is centrally located.  fisherman\\'s wharf, alcatraz, lombard st, coit tower are only a few minutes away.  the cable car is right outside the door.  nobb hill is a very upscale neighborhood with plenty of delicious restaurants within a few blocks.  pj was a very accommodating host and i would recommend staying here.cute decoration and good location of the house. 10 minutes walk to fisherman wharf and union square.a very nice place! it\\'s very convenient to get food and visit china town and japan town. love it.the place is just a room and fully occupied by the owner his friend and wife with girlfriend.  when i arrived they were making curry and the place smelled like indian food.  i am not used to the strong order.  the pictures makes the place look really clean but it is quite messy for my standards.  the people are really nice but for $383 for two night i rather get a hotel room.  location was fairly central and owners did their best to make us feel welcomed.  neat enough but dont expect it spotless.  apartment was fully occupied during our stay with late night/early morning phone calls which detracted from our stay unfortunately. single shared bathroom.naveen and his friends were very friendly and hospitable, and i also had enough privacy to prepare for a job interview. he also was very nice about letting me leave my bags in the apartment until my late flight the next night.  the neighborhood is great, with lots of good food and nightlife nearby, i wish i had time to stay a bit longer!great location and very welcoming host.  was not expecting to be drawn into the comings and goings of others in the apartment but that is what happened and it made the trip all the more enjoyable and engaging.  made some great contacts and made to feel right at home. recommend the experience! i was pleased with my stay here. the room was clean and naveen and jp were very friendly. the location was nice.quiet and clean, everything as advertised.  we were very much welcomed as naveen is working hard to make the airbnb idea work well. naveen and his family were great hosts. definetly a great place to stay if you are missing having your family around while travelling. the apartment is nicely renovated and in a great location for access to the top sights.so this was our first airbnb experience and honestly, we have no complaints at all!  naveen and pj were wonderful hosts!  we arrived early and they gave us a great brunch spot that the locals go to!  this spot is at a great location in sf.  i mean, you honestly can\\'t beat it with a trolley stop right outside the front door that\\'ll take you directly to lombard street and fisherman\\'s wharf!  \\n\\ni was slightly skeptical on airbnb, but after this trip, we\\'ll use it again, especially if hosts like naveen are out there!  \\na wonderful, centrally-located place stay in sf. naveen and his friend pj were incredibly friendly and gracious hosts. the room was spacious and very clean - well-decorated and quiet, with a private bath (awesome rain shower!). the neighborhood is walkable and convenient to a lot of attractions - cable cars stop right outside and there are several coffee shops and restaurants on the block. we felt immediately welcomed and taken care of. would recommend to anyone!great location, great host! \\nclean room with accommodating host.naveen was a very warm, welcoming host. the apartment is located in a great part of town, very clean, and the room was large & comfy. naveen was flexible with check in/out which we greatly appreciated and had some wonderful recommendations for places to see/eat around town and how to get/to from. i\\'d highly recommend staying here if you\\'re in sf. thanks for a wonderful stay, naveen. mr. naveen and his daughter have been very kind to me. i feel like if a was in the house of one of my uncles por another relative. he\\'s very friendly and i recommend the stay. it is a quite place, not fancy but nice. more por less near to union square (like 20min walking). i will recommend it.naveen and his family were excellent hosts for our stay in san fran. the location is great, most things are in walking distance. if the walking gets too much the cable car and bus stops are just outside the apartment. \\n\\nwe had our own private room and bathroom (the rain shower head was amazing!) the room also had access to the fire escape that lead to the rooftop where you can enjoy san fran\\'s water views. this was the first time staying in a room that was part of someone\\'s home and it worked out great. naveen and his daughter are charming and flowed with our coming and going. the room feels very private with tons of light, a bay window with a little table and chairs and the location is awesome. you can hop a cable car out the front door or walk anywhere from there. loved our stay. thank you, naveen!\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had a great stay by naveen! the location is perfect,  just hop on the cable car in front of the door and your on your way into the city! naveen was very welcoming and kind. wanted to help us as we\\'re he could.  also his daughter who met us the first night. very friendly people. we were in the king size room with private bathroom. the room was clean and spacious,  the bathroom was a delight. new and clean,  looked like a 4 star hotel room. as it was are honeymoon,  they even had gifts ready for us! would be happy to stay here again!naveen is a good host, very relaxed and welcoming. my stay was very pleasant and hassle free. the room was clean and comfortable. will stay again.i did stay at naveen\\'s place for two nights. a nice room and appartment in the heart of san francisco . naveen is very helpfull when you as a tourist has questions where to go, see eat etc. only minus is that the cable train is running just outside the windows and it makes noise from early morning.\\nbr, lars from copenhagen denmark i had their phone numbers and any time i called they were there. i was nervous about it but all went well. it was my first air b and b.  i wish the nook cafe was mentioned more! it is the spot for all the hot cool people ... we fit right in. need not have gone anywhere else.  but we did. went to fishermans warf area: hyde st national park is a downhill walk. and 12 dollar cab ride back. powell street market square area is a 7 dollar cable car ride one way. connects to bart and then sfo. and on and onreally raccomanded! house is perfect, big bedroom, big pvt bathroom with wonderful shower. a the house very clean and nat is really a perfect host. perfect house position in the right place of san francisco. if i will go again to sf i will stay here again! naveen\\'s apartment was perect for ua - wonderful location, very spacious, etc. naveen was a great host - he was friendly, social, and always helpful and accommodating. i would definitely recommend staying here.we had a super great time.  really wanted to experience the nob hill /russian hill area.  we were upstairs looking out our window at the cable cars, there is a cute café downstairs with outdoor seating and restaurants within the same block!  \\r\\nnaveen is a welcome host, helpful in navigating the city and helping visitors feel at home!naveen went above and beyond. we were able to walk to lombard st, pier 39, and fisherman\\'s wharf from his place. the trolley pick up was right on the corner as was a nice little coffee/ wine bar.  the place was modern and clean and i would definitely stay again!very nice host! we had a great and interesting time. the room was beautiful and comfortable. thank you very much for this experience!naveen provided us with a very clean and luxourius place in the centre of san francisco. when we arrived he showed us around and we had a very pleasent and enjoyable evening including interesting discussions with him. \\r\\nadditionally, he organized our lift to the bart station the next day and welcomed us another time when we came back to san francisco. we had lots of fun and are very thankful for the warm welcome.\\r\\nhope to see you again soon.\\r\\nbest, \\r\\nrosithis is the perfect spot and the view is terrificnaveen was a very friendly, generous and welcoming host whose apartment complex is in a great location. from the moment we walked in, naveen was eager to get to know us and answer any questions/provide suggestions about the city.  highly recommend!our host naveen was very welcoming. he especially loved having the energy of our little boy in his home. his place is lovely but the kitchen and living room were rather unkept when we arrived. he accommodated me by giving us the room that was better suited for our family. the master bedroom included access to the rooftop was quite amazing ! it made the stay for us.  he offered to cook us dinner and was very hospitable.we loved staying with naveen!  he is a natural when it comes to hosting and entertaining guests!  very friendly and very knowledgeable about everything sf! the room he gave us was very comfortable and beautiful! private entrance to the rooftop and fully remodeled room/bathroom.  we will definitely be coming back!  it was only one night. the place was good and the view at the roof was great. \\nthe cleaness of the kitchen and the apartment in general was no good, dirty!! we did not feel comfortable for that reason. \\ni suggest naveen to make sure that the entire apartment get clean before visitors.naveen\\'s place was a really great apartment with a modern look that was in the heart of nob hill and on the cable car line. the room was large and comfortable. the location was fabulous but be ready for the hills and get a transit pass for multiple days - then the cable car is easy to use and cheaper. naveen was a good host who was very friendly and made us feel at home. great location. room is exactly as in  the pictures. finally, nabeen has been very kind and helpful to us. we  would repeat in  next visit  to  san francisco.great stay! naveen is extremely friendly and helpful and the apartment is clean and modern. there is a housekeeper who takes care of linens and cleaning and the entire stay felt just like a boutique hotel. naveen even greeted us with a fruit salad and allowed us to park in his garage. we will definitely recommend to friends!we spent 2 days at naveen\\'s apartment,it was our first experience of airbnb and it was not bad actually very warm. naveen found us the parking lot and welcomed us with his special tea. the location was very great we went to all kinds of places including fishermans wharf, and the cable car was just outside the apartment, you can always see people hop on the car and laughing. next time we\\'d like to stay here again for all week!thank u dear naveen:)perfect, comfortable, near everything, but parking is a bit difficult.we had a wonderful first time experience with airbnb! naveen was a great host and made us feel very comfortable. i was nervous about using airbnb because this was our honeymoon  and staying in a strangers home was a bit odd to me but i\\'m so glad that we did. san francisco is a very expensive place to stay and even if you do find something in your price range it will likely be a crappy 2 star hotel in a not so great area. if this is your first time, even if it\\'s your honeymoon please take my advice and do it! naveen was great and his place is in the best location. you really get the feel of being a local when you walk around his neighborhood and the cable car is literally right out his front door! the home was clean and nicely  decorated. he even had special touches like waters and chocolates in our room and champagne. we would definitely stay here again on our next trip to san francisco.great host, great location.  i have lived in the city and do work here every few months or so, so for me i was more focused on a nice clean place with a good location, which is exactly what i got. for tourists especially though i think this is probably one of the best locations to get the most out of their trip while not sacrificing comfort. also this location really is in the \"real\" nob hill,  a lot of time people say nob hill and it is actually the border with the tenderloin, and tourists get a bit of a shock when they step outside, while again here this is actually a great neighborhood.  naveen was very accommodating and responsive, and even though i did not get to experience it as much as i wish i could have his roof deck is a gem in it of itself. finally again cannot stress enough it was clean and quiet, which is a hard combo to find in the heart of sf.naveen was a very gracious host and the location was ideal. being located only a mile or less from fishermans warf, we were close to every area we wanted to visit. \\nthe only downfall would be the trolley cars that pass right by the building, they can be a great access to the other areas of the city, but they do tend to be loud. if you\\'re a light sleeper you may want to consider something to help with the street noise. naveen was extremely warm, friendly and cheerful. a really great host. i was not feeling well the first night i arrived and he offered me ayurvedic herbs which tasted strong but worked well. the bedroom was very clean, spacious and the bed was very comfortable! there was also ample closet space and hangers, perfect for us women. the bathroom was also modern and spotless, and i did not bump into anyone else sharing it. the nob hill location is great, and central. the touristy but must-experience cable cars going in 2 prime directions, were also right at my doorstep. the only downside of this place is the noise from the street (there was the sound of a motor that went on into the night, that seems to be connected to the operation of the cable cars), and the sound of the actual cable cars. i use ear plugs all the time anyway, so that helped. this is what city living is about! i happened to have a look at the master room which had an attached bath and access to the roof deck, now this room was even larger, and extremely quiet as it didn\\'t face the street. staying with naveen was an excellent experience. the place was nice, safe, and centrally located. naveen was a very gracious host. i had a great time drinking tea with him and exchanging stories. next time i go to san francisco, i\\'ll stay with naveen again.excellent accommodation! naveen was extremely helpful and made my stay very enjoyable. highly recommend the house as it\\'s a fantastic location and relatively close to everything.\\n\\nthe room was well kept and the house was very tidy. overall it was an excellent experience and look forward to staying with naveen again in the future.great location in san francisco! the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. the shared bathroom has a great shower. naveen was easy to work with and he happily accommodated all of my scheduling needs.naveen was a super host - he was accommodating to all our requests and was very helpful.  recommended!!perfect stay!  last minute booking, clean room, great location, wonderfully helpful and accommodating host. stay with naveen!naveen was a very accommodating host, very friendly and helpful! the house was beautiful, clean and close to everything :) the cable car is a little noisy for light sleepers but it didn\\'t bother me! thank you again naveen!! :)naveen made us feel welcome. he is friendly. he put up with our limited time in the apartment as we were coming and going early and late. we had a memorable vacation in san francisco! we felt comfortable and welcomed into his beautiful home and enjoyed cooking with him! he was a great host and we felt like we were at home, while visiting this beautiful city. we now have a new friend in san francisco:) amazing experience!naveen was very welcoming and made sure that we were comfortable. as it was christmas, he invited us to dinner and to hang out with him, which we did. overall, it was a really good experience staying there.naveen was a fantastic host who immediately made my husband and i feel at home. he offered us tea upon arrival (not to mention through out our stay there) and was a help from when we arrived to the very last moment we left. \\r\\n\\r\\nnaveen\\'s place is a home away from home and being here really topped our san fran experience. the room(and house) had a warm cosy look and feel to it. \\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommend naveen\\'s place. i know my husband and i will be back there when we return to san fran, not only for the comfy stay, but also to see a friend we made during our travels to san fran. sf was the last stop on my travels before heading back to australia. what an incredible sf experience it was staying at naveen\\'s bnb, the location is brilliant with everything you need right within walking distance, a short uber, cable car or bus away.  naveen was very warm and welcoming throughout my stay, he was constantly asking if i was enjoying myself, even offering  to cook me a meal, tips on where to eat and must-see areas of sf. you can really immerse yourself in the local scene if you want to avoid the tourist traps, just ask naveen he will be happy to assist. if naveen offers to cook you an omlette you must say yes, you won\\'t be disappointed! kind gestures like this from naveen made me feel welcomed and gave the entire household and other bnb guests a chance to get to know one another. the environement was very social which worked really well for me as i enjoy meeting new people. i even went on a day trip to sausalito with some other bnb guests from milwaukee.  we also went out together several times to explore the sf eating and drinking culture. each day/evening we would walk in a new direction from naveen\\'s unit and discover new restaurants and bars for some great food and fun times. polk street was my favourite street. only a few minutes walk from naveen\\'s unit and you have just about endless choices for quality food and wine. naveen also often tagged along when he was available for lunch, dinner and some exploring of the city a true gentleman and host. \\n\\nnaveen\\'s nephew mike and his girlfriend mahogany are also tenants at the unit. both being young and social it was easy and an enjoyable experience hanging out with mike and mahogany. mike was also happy to assist in offering his tips on where to eat, explore etc. and would often tag along adding to the experience. if you are a keen foodie/chef mike is your guy. he helped point me in the right direction for hidden gem restaurants and off the beaten track adventures. when i wasn\\'t out and about mike would be also offering me homecooked meals which were amazing. i greatly appreciated some home cooking as i had been travelling through california for about 2 months prior to my visit. \\n\\noverall i can\\'t thank naveen and his family enough for an unforgettable stay in sf. i am very much looking forward to my next trip. thanks again naveen take care and see you again soon.naveen met us when we arrived and was quite welcoming. the apartment was very similar to the photographs.  (there were often strong cooking smells from the kitchen which i could have done without). the smoke detector was missing from the ceiling.  the steep stairs to the roof top deck were dirty with cans and cigarette butts but the view was spectacular. the neighboring apartment was noisy with a party one night. the neighborhood offered a great location for visiting san francisco. while the corner was quite busy and noisy with traffic and cable cars but had a \\'neighborhood feel\\'.  if you plan to drive however, parking is very difficult. there is limited on street parking and public garages are nearly non-existent.  close to many restaurants, bars and cafes.this was a great place to stay in sf. right on hyde st within walking distance to everything we needed. naveen was very helpful and accommodating. i would recommend this location to anyone staying for fun or business.very good host, naveen likes talking to the roomates. the bed is very comfortable and the neighbourhood is very good. cable is right outside and you are take bus too. our host was incredibly welcoming, offering us suggestions for places to eat. we were even greeted with some freshly cooked pasta. the location was perfect for what we wanted to see in the bay area. couldn\\'t have asked for a better experience. good location, very easy access to cable cars and public transport. room was clean. kitchen privileges. off-street parking for one car is a real benefit, though access is tight and egress is tricky. enjoyed meeting host\\'s nephew\\'s dobie, bear, a real sweetie. great view from rooftop deck, but stairwell access is filthy (inconsiderate neighbors). while the i nterior room had little daylight, it was quiet and had a private bathroom.naveen was very hospitable. he upgraded us to a different room with a private bathroom since it was vacant. the room and bathroom were clean and very nice. the rooftop view is amazing. you can see the golden gate bridge and a number of parts of the city. the area of town is nice. there is a great breakfast place called mymy\\'s nearby (and a bunch of other places).had a great stay. naveen is very nice and his nephew mike is great too. location was very awesome! home very clean. naveen is a super host. he deserves a gold medal. he is like one of your best friend in san francisco. he has really nice topics to talk about life and silicon valley. i am sure you will enjoy the talks very much. mikey is also super cool guy. we had a very nice city walk with his gf and amanda. i can say this was my best airbnb experiences ever. thank you for everything and hope to see you again.wow wow, what a great host is naveen, welcoming, warm, willing to help, everything you can wish from a host. the place: superb location walking to the main attractions, cosy, big, light and clean there is even parking. a++ highly recommended.it was a great experience. large room and very central to where i needed to be. naveen was very flexible with my checkout and let me stay latergreat location in the city! the room was very spacious and clean with a connected private bath.  it was also amazing to learn the room had access to the roof deck for an amazing view of the bay! hospitality was not spared here and would definitely recommend this spot to others! it was a terrible experience. when we first arrived, host was not in the house and even hang up my phone call. when we entered the house, the last guests have not yet left and their luggages were still in the room. everything was messy and room was not cleaned at all. cups and other utensils in the kitchen seems not cleans and there are a lot of stuff in the sink. \\nthe worst thing is that the washing machine was working from 1 am to 3 am! it was pretty noisy!\\nthe good thing is the location. it is in the middle of everywhere.nice and clean room. naveen and mikey made us feel welcomed and at home. we booked the room last minute and check-in was fast and painless. naveen even offered to take care of our dog. the apartment is fairly close to all the tourist spots and bars. there\\'s a rooftop that you can see the whole city. great time in sfo, ideal location. the house is much better than the pictures even! it\\'s extremely cozy, and the location of the house is great if you\\'re visiting sf, or there for work too. \\n\\namenities are top notch, and the bath is very well stocked too :) \\n\\nthe living is extremely comfortable and it\\'s a nice place to laze around on a sunday afternoon. \\n\\nrhonda and her husband were great hosts. i bumped into them once on the patio (which is beautiful) and once or twice outside the house and they\\'re very warm and welcoming.  would definitely recommend this place. we loved this apartment--spacious, comfortable, great location. the neighborhood is fabulous and it\\'s easy to get around. rhonda\\'s place was beautiful and elegantly decorated. it was clean and well-furnished. kitchen was well-appointed and bathroom was fully stocked with a variety of toiletries. the place was spacious, but it only had one bath and one toilet. beds were very comfortable and linens were very soft. it was like staying at a high-star hotel. the location was excellent. it felt like home.the host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.rhonda\\'s home was great for myself and a few coworkers!

they were very welcoming and gracious hosts. everything was as listed, but in reality, even better (there were even guest chocolates on the night stand). the room was very clean and the entire place glistened with a modern minimalism and comfort. the puppy max was very friendly, quiet, and impeccably groomed. private bathroom was exceptional and stocked with soaps, shampoos and hand lotions. we found the guide of san francisco on the bed stand and it came in very handy during our exploration. the view from the window is lovely and continues to the hill of alamo square a few blocks away. the location was perfect! it\\'s walkable distance to the alamo square and to the golden gate park. many wonderful restaurants in the area too. we ate breakfast 3 mornings in the row at the bean bag, a splendid little crepes and coffee shop. we rented the car, but definitely could have gotten away without one. parking wasn\\'t too problematic. each night we were able to find a spot within a couple of blocks - free and one that doesn\\'t require to move every 2 hours. we have received no tickets. the second day we used public transportation and it was very accessible and cheap. each evening michael and novita greeted us with smiles and were interested to listen to our experiences of the day. they are very easy-going personable couple. i would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone who wants a unique and unforgettable experience of the city. i had a wonderful overall experience staying in michael and novita\\'s guest room.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe accommodations: the entire apartment was modern and clean.  the bed was quite comfortable.  i was even able to take advantage of the ability to sit out on the deck (which was right outside the guest room) and soak in some sun for a couple of hours, which was amazing.  the common space was very pleasant and comfortable as well.  finally, it was great to have my own - quite nice - bathroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts: michael and novita were great hosts.  very organized, attentive, and helpful.  as soon as we confirmed my stay, they immediately provided all of the information i needed to check in, check out, access wifi, etc.  they made it very easy for me to flexibly check in.  they gave me my privacy/space, while also making sure i had everything i needed.  when we did interact, i had a great time chatting with them - both very lovely people.\\r\\n\\r\\nside-note on the parking situation, in case you\\'re curious: i rented a car for my trip, and it surprisingly easy to park very close to the apartment (from experience, i know it can be painfully difficult in certain parts of sf).thank you very much for the wonderful 2 days. i got a chance to meet michael\\'s puppy and feel welcomed from the very beginning. michael and his wife are genuinely outstanding hosts. i truly recommend!this was my first airbnb experience & it will definitely not be my last!

they have a beautiful home in the middle of mission. amazing food destinations like tartine bakery and gracias madre are just a few minutes away on foot and you are super close to the bart.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe home is big and spacious with a well equipped kitchen and plenty of seating. the suite bedroom and bathroom are private and tucked away. they keep a very clean home that is a pleasure to stay in.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile it\\'s not a super quiet neighborhood - there is a club nearby and lots of nighttime activity during the weekends - you can\\'t ask for a better place to stay if you want to be in the middle of it all. thank you dino!great location and super convenient room that makes you feel like you are at your own private place. owners were very welcoming and nice too.this place is so wonderful! i stayed for one week and i will definitely book it again if i come back to sf. it\\'s clean, very spacious, it\\'s on the heart of sf, you can move everywhere from here. dino is a excellent host, you can ask anything and he responds very quickly, he is top!\\r\\nthanks for this week!!

dino was friendly and though we didn\\'t interact with our hosts a lot, we felt very welcomed and comfortable in their house. \\r\\nthere is noise from the street on weekend nights but it wasn\\'t really an issue for us. \\r\\ngreat place!

would definelty reccomend ! i only had a brief stay, but was a good experience !the perfect place to stay ! the host is super friendly, and i really like the decoration of this house. it\\'s also in a convenient location, with some good cafe ground. this is home away from home, literary! dino was such a great host the entire stay that definitely will hope to book again in his place, only if we\\'re lucky to find availability, since now i understand why it is pretty much booked in advance. the house is very good located, just a 5 min walk from 16th station, and the room was impecable and neat. tv is huge with tons of channels to choose from, although my girlfriend and i barely watched tv since we spent the day in downtown, but at night or early morning it was perfect.  tons of restaurants, cafés, bars, tons of life out there and nearby. look no further, stay in here!my boyfriend and i were looking for something located centrally, so we can walk around as well as get the public transport easily. it’s a great new apartment in a good location, and the room is just as emily described. there are few good restaurants on the block, in case you need a quick meal, two coffee shops and a bicycle rental behind the house. we haven’t met emily personally, her roommate met us in the apartment, but she was a great host, regularly checking with us if everything is ok, and if we need something. we felt like home, everything worked well, emily seemed as a very easy going person. we would definitely recommend staying there.leah\\'s place was great and she was very accommodating!  her fully stocked kitchen helped us have a great thanksgiving. thanks leah!!leah\\'s house in the mission was great and super clean. it had every amenity we needed and much more- the house is very roomy and could\\'ve accommodated another person comfortably. each of the bedrooms had an incredibly comfortable bed and it\\'s own bathroom, so we had privacy. we also thought the back yard was beautiful. the house has central heating too plus extra bedding so we were never cold! the kitchen is stocked with just about every convenience you could need to cook a 3 course dinner or just espresso and toast in the morning. and... the location couldn\\'t be better, close to so many restaurants, cafes, markets, and bus/bart lines. leah was also very efficient in contacting me ahead of time and making sure we got the keys and were settled in. i would definitely stay here again and would certainly refer a friend!we\\'ve been the first guests at sergei and amy and had a great stay at the room/aparment.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is on the ground level, next to the garage. sergei and amy live upstairs. we had our own entrance with a lot of privacy. the room itself had an own bathroom, a bar, fridge, microwave, cups and a stereo system with blutooth. also the decoration and furniture were very stylish with its rock scheme! we had absolut everything we needed. privacy level is like an own studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nsergei and amy were great hosts. sergei was so kind, warm and welcoming. he introduced the room to us and explained we are the first guests. you could really feel with how much passion this studio has been built and designed. he helped us with questions, were always available, very flexible with our check-in time. we have been even welcomed with a few beers in the fridge.\\r\\n\\r\\none night we wanted to go out in a night club and sipped before a few beers and drinks. the atmosphere of this room was even so good that we decided to stay at home and enjoy our evening/night there. also we extended our stay as it was so good.\\r\\n\\r\\nso all in all: very recommendable, top room/studio, top host. this booking is a gem!\\r\\n\\r\\nmaggie & artjom, happy first guests :)the room is just like in the picture and the neighborhood is very nice.very welcoming hosts. they are ready to go a mile to make you feel comfortable. late night check in, 5am chek out, lots of towels, everything is not a problem. the room is actually more like a studio with its own bathroom and bar, everything with a style of its own. neighborhood is great with this classic sf hills around, close transportation, supermarket, starbucks. overnight parking on the street without problems, 2 h parking during day time and 24h free parking in 5-6 blocks. i was really happy to stay at rockin\\' room. nice clean room with private bathroom just as advertised. cool old stereo system that connects to bluetooth so you can play tunes while you hang out between city adventures. great experience, would definitely stay at the rockin room again!great room in the sunset!  sergei and amy were both great; very accommodating upon arrival and were available as needed throughout.  a lot of space and privacy here; the room is on the bottom floor with a private entrance and you have a key to come and go as needed.  the room has a fun and classy music ambiance and the fridge has a guest shelf stocked with beverages.  overall i have nothing but good things to say about the location and its hosts and i\\'d highly recommend to anyone looking in the area!i had a lovely experience staying here with my husband and young children. the house was clean and pretty, and even nicer than i\\'d expected from the photos! there are cheerful flowers overflowing from the beds on either side of the few steps leading up to the front door. the inside is flooded with natural light, with a nice modern kitchen and recessed lighting on dimmers throughout the home. the place was spacious and our beds were comfortable\\r\\n\\r\\nit was a really great place to travel with my two kids, a toddler and a 4-year-old, as the upstairs bedroom basically doubles as a large playroom, with books and toys that my kids loved! the usable backyard, with a small sandbox, was nice, too!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is great--walk less than a block down the hill and you\\'re on a great street with some restaurants and little stores. turn right and walk a block and you\\'ll find a playground and neighborhood library. it really was a great sf neighborhood experience!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe hosts left us a few tips about the neighborhood as well as a nice basket of little goodies--everything from wine to toiletries we might have forgotten to crayons and a coloring book for our children! though david was out of the country during our stay, he was very responsive to our questions by email, and his friend who met us at the home was also very helpful and pleasant (even though we kept her waiting a while since it took forever to get our rental car). \\r\\n\\r\\noverall, a lovely house and an awesome experience! we would happily stay here again when visiting san francisco.already left a review.... not sure why it\\'s askingthis place was pretty cool but the house was not cleaned or organized at all. there was just random stuff everywhere. i tried to condense it a bit and even swept their floors because they were pretty dirty and i am ocd. the place has potential but it needs to be handled in a more professional manner. they should hire me as their interior designer. :-)mitch and all his roommates were very welcoming and great hosts. he kept in touch well through. the apt is located in an amazing neighborhood in the mission district. right in the back side there is access to a really nice street called balmy. it has street awesome street art. thanks for hosting me mitch!i had never been to san francisco so this looked like the best deal. best price for the best location. it\\'s located in the mission district, about a 15-20 minute drive to fisherman\\'s wharf and downtown. the mission district is a nice alternative place to stay. it\\'s quieter than busier downtown. it was a very decent pad for san fran living. the room was clean with a tooth brush, tooth paste, and some clean towels waiting for me. it had a desk and wifi available. perfect for business.\\r\\n\\r\\nmitch had 2 roommates (in different rooms) that i got to connect with. turns out that we had more in common than i thought. a pleasant experience overall.thanks for being so accommodating with my arrival time! thanks, also, to your roommate who was very helpful in getting me settled in - the tour of the apartment, wifi info (so important! :), and explaining the parking situation to me. the apartment is nice and in a great neighborhood, and mitch is very polite and responsive. when booking i requested to drop off my bags in the morning of my arrival day - which i know is unusual and he could have declined - and he said this would be possible. it didn\\'t work out that way, but i\\'m aware scheduling is always difficult, so it\\'s not a big deal.\\r\\nthe room is separated from the living room through french doors, and behind those doors is the living room tv (as depicted in the photo), which you can hear clearly. not a problem when no one\\'s at home. in my case, when i asked the roommate to turn the tv down so i could go to sleep, he did, and my earplugs did the rest. no big issue for me, but just something to be aware of. accurate listing. very comfortable bed. the neighborhood has a nice variety of restaurants. host and his roommate are very friendly.mitch and his roommate were very welcoming and responded immediately to all of my questions. the apartment was clean for the most part and i was made to feel at home. if you love good coffee and mexican food you\\'re not going to find a better neighborhood in the city. this place was perfect! a friend recommended i stay in the mission and i see why - the neighborhood has a ton of character, awesome restaurants and coffee shops. mitch was very easy to get in touch with. his roommates were super friendly and fun and even invited me to a cookout they were hosting :)the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.mission is a very covenient neighborhood to stay at, you can enjoy several food and coffee places. the bart is really close so it makes it easy to move around. i didn\\'t meet mitch but met his roomies who are really nice. the room was fine and communication with mitch was fluent. very nice place, with a great location.  i loved being close to a whole foods, and a sushi bar downstairs.  house was even more beautiful than in the pictures and tommy was super helpful and easy to work with!i rented tommy\\'s beautiful penthouse for a special dinner for airbnb employees. tommy was super-accommodating, from providing us with great music to letting us move furniture to make space for our table. his space is clean, spacious, and perfect for a party or large group, the views from the rooftop are incredible and heat lamps make the space perfect even on a chilly san francisco night! \\r\\n\\r\\nthank you tommy for making our event memorable! this apartment is more like a palace! staying here was the perfect way to experience san francisco, from the stunning views downstairs to the breath-taking serenity of the roof. the beds were comfy, the showers were relaxing and the blue-tooth speakers kept the week filled with good music. i\\'ll be back for sure. the apartment is absolutely gorgeous and tommy was super easy to work with.  if there is a more spectacular place to stay in san francisco, i think that you would be hard pressed to find it.   top notch experience- i highly recommend you stay here!we were extremely pleased with the penthouse! everything was great and we had an amazing time.  views are spectacular and the place is just awesome. big thanks to tommy for being such a great host. we hope to return very soon!!our stay in tommy & michelle\\'s apartment was amazing! i found myself taking photos around the apartment in the hope that one day i get to build my own penthouse. this place tops all the places i have stayed in via airbnb. it was spotlessly clean, everything was better than we expected. the beds were comfortable and the roof terrace was truly spectacular. i highly recommend this place if you are staying in san fran. i\\'ll be back very soon and tommy will be my first point of contact. i just hope the apartment is available next time. thankswhat a wonderful experience it was to spend a week at tommy\\'s 3 br penthouse in san francisco! to say the view was incredible doesnt do it justice. tommy was a great host and helped us when we had any questions. he was easily accessible and made great suggestions on places to go, eat, visit, etc. we will definitely like to return to this spectacular home!we booked tommy\\'s telegraph hill penthouse to use as an event space for a 15 person dinner for our employees. the space could not have been more perfect - the kitchen is fully stocked with enough place settings for more than double what we had and was great for our caterers to use, and the guests were floored by the beautiful views from the rooftop and living room. we served wine and cheese on deck before dining inside.  i would absolutely recommend booking tommy\\'s place for either an overnight or an event. everything went totally seamlessly. the best view, the best place, the best host! \\nwe absolutely loved this place.  we used the apartement a girlfriends weekend and the apartment was perfect for 5 women from all over the country.  you cannot find a better view or an apartment with more convenience.  there are lots of stairs so if you have anyone who has trouble with that this is not the place for you, but other than that, it was perfect.excellent in every way!we just rented the place for the day for a work retreat. it was absolutely perfect and tommy was great to work with. such an incredible place, and the view is unbelievable. we had the pleasure of celebrating our moms 60th birthday at this place, and we didn\\'t want to leave it! we literally hung out all day each day at the home enjoying the views and the incredible space. tommy and his assistant nancy were wonderful to work w/ and prompt in their response to any questions that we had. we will def. be coming back! this is a spectacular apt, impeccably furnished with extraordinary views. host was great. spectacular is an accurate description of this property. we rented the whole house, including the  1 bd. on the 1st floor for our stay. we were there for work, but felt like a vacation. the view is incredible and the house is beautiful. from the roof top patio with the heat lamps and giant grill, to the nice and so comfortable bedrooms, this house lives up to the expectation. we prepped for our holiday party in the beautiful kitchen then still had time to enjoy the house. we actually preferred to stay in and cook instead of going out to dinner. we would recommend this property to anyone. looking forward to staying again soon.hosted a birthday party here, was scheduled to have the place by 4 pm.  when we got there the cleaners were still cleaning the place. i met tommy and his crew, they did their best to clean as much as possible before the guests started to arrive.  i was promised two parking spots and received none.  other than those two issues everything else went pretty well.  great house to have a party and would consider going back again.  thanks again tommy!first off, this is hands down the best place i\\'ve seen on airbnb and really brings the quality of places found on airbnb to a new level. i stayed here with my extended family visiting from australia for three nights and the place was just perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nit felt like a five star hotel experience, but with an amazing layout, access to a fully stocked kitchen, and a view like none i\\'ve seen in san francisco before. my family were at a lost for words and really gave them a stand out bay area experience they will remember for a long time. i\\'m so happy i splurged on this place - it was well well worth it!\\r\\n\\r\\ni loved the high powered outdoor heaters, the viking bbq grill which we used almost every night, the two parking spaces (!!!), and the super comfortable beds.\\r\\n\\r\\ntommy thanks for being a great host, quick to respond and for answering all our questions on demand. appreciate your note about not having to \"lift a finger\" to clean up the place and to simply close the door after ourselves - you\\'re an awesome host! many thanks for the memories!the apartment is huge and the views are dreamy! the place was very clean and had some sweet amenities... my favorite was the shower in the master suite with an incredible steam feature. the massive tv didn\\'t hurt either ;) i could keep going on and on with all the cool stuff. \\ntommy was as quick as me on texting which is quite a compliment. is so great that he uses codes instead of actual keys - so, not having to coordinate key\\'s stuff was a plus too.\\nhighly recommendedthe reservation was canceled 37 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the apartment, the location, and the views are absolutely spectacular.  i have rented all over the world and this apartment ranks with the best of the best.  watching the sunset each night over the bay and the city was truly breathtaking and enjoying the twinkling lights of the city at night through all the countless amazing windows was beyond beautiful.   the location is perfect: just steps away from markets, cafes, and the restaurants of little italy yet wonderfully quiet at all times of the day and night.  the interior and rooftop of the apartment is exactly as pictured and even more gorgeous in person.  it will truly take your breath away when you step in the door and when you see the terrace.  if you love to cook, you\\'ll be in heaven when you see the viking appliances in the kitchen.  tommy was terrific to work with and very responsive to any and all questions. great place and location with awesome views.  tommy (host) was very accommodating and we had everything we needed.  walking distance to north beach restaurants a plus. the walk back uphill will make you hungry again.  would rent again, for sure. everything was great! the place is beautiful and well stocked.breathtaking and comfortable!  the owner tommy was extremely accommodating.  the entire penthouse is well furnished and extremely comfortable, the views are incredible, and the rooftop deck is perfect for entertaining guests.  looking forward to staying here again.our family had a wonderful time at this spacious home. we were there for 5 days and 4 nights. we didn\\'t know what to expect, since this was our first time using airbnb. the rooms were a good size and the closets were very large. the master suite even has a steam shower and jacuzzi tub. the kitchen is one level up, and it opens to the living area. that level has amazing views of the city. then, lastly, on the next level, there is the terrace. you probably can\\'t find a better view of sf on airbnb. the view on that terrace is amazing with coit tower on one side and the transamerica building just peaking out on the other side. straight ahead is a magnificent view of the city and sf bay just to the side. every morning, we would eat breakfast and have coffee from the keurig provided on the terrace. you can even see the golden gate bridge from there, when it isn\\'t foggy. overall, it was an amazing experience and tommy was a wonderful host, although we only got to meet him as we were leaving. we would love to stay there again. though i had already expected the fantastic view and experience from the pictures and reviews shared by other guests before i checked in, the whole room view, arts collections, decorations and all handy appliances made us astonished and speechless. i would recommend other visitors, especially a group of friends to pick tommy\\'s penthouse. what i like most: the sheer beautiful view from the window of living room; nice bathrooms and kitchen; good location.\\n\\n非常棒的公寓,住六七个人没问题,三个浴室和两个厨房和冰箱让大家在早晚的时候能节省时间。洗衣机和烘干机很先进,房间里各种用品,从沐浴液洗发水到吹风机应有尽有。基本上没有遇到任何不方便的地方,除了把行李搬上来略有不便,但换来的是高处无敌的景色。amazing place! the penthouse had the most incredible views of the city and the roof top was the perfect place have a glass of wine and kick back. would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for the best views of the city and relaxation. bed rooms very spacious with walk in closets and flat screens. heaven!oh my god - what a view! breathtaking, spectacular views from essentially every room and not the least from the terrace. very modern townhouse with an impressive art collection which added an extra flavor to our stay. the bedrooms were decorated very nicely and the bathrooms, especially the double shower with imbedded steam sauna really impressed us! we truly enjoyed our stay in san fransisco and the location was ideal for walking downtown and to all main tourist attractions.fantastic apartment. the view from the rooftop was jaw dropping. the apartment had everything we needed and more besides. tommy was easy to contact and always helpful. would definitely stay again. great experience.  very easy access.  beautiful accommodations and fantastic view and location.\\r\\nwould definitely consider staying there again with a group.the apartment is beautifully furnished and in immaculate condition, and there can only be a tiny number of properties in san francisco with as good a rooftop view. tommy was extremely helpful and obliging, and he (and his neighbours) were kind enough not to complain when i briefly failed to park our rather oversized car as neatly as i could/should have. my partner, our three teenage daughters and i would all stay here again without hesitation.this place is awesome! the view from the balcony is simply one of the best in the city in my opinion.this place is nicely furnished and everything seemed to be working properly. the rooms are spacious and spread out nicely. the steam room/ shower is very relaxing. bbq on the top was great. this is one place you must check out if you want a place with a great views of san francisco. all of us enjoyed our stay and will be back soon!luxury apartment with great location and view and clean rooms. tommy is very nice and easy to communicate.the rooftop patio view is incredible. tommy provided excellent communication and has prepared his home really well for a comfortable stay. couldn\\'t recommend this more highly!from the first look on the web to final departure we loved tommy\\'s place. the listing and photos give a great hint but do not fully capture how great the place is. clean, well organized and spacious. we were 3 guys traveling for business meetings and the number of tvs, integrated sound and 3 bedrooms with private ensuite bathrooms each was a fantastic set up. the communal kitchen / living room was largely ignored by us but would be great for a family or those more keen to \"eat in\". tons of light and those views will stay with me forever!\\r\\nsplit over 2 floors plus the awesome roof-deck at the top of a number of hills (you didn\\'t think that view was \"easy\" to get, did you?) we were generally pretty happy to get settled. spent a good deal of time on the roof - truly spectacular for morning coffee and end of day drinks. \\r\\ntommy himself was very friendly and helpful. we had one small issue and tommy diligently helped us through - even though he was far out of town.\\r\\nin summary - amazing and definitely a place and host to revisit!excellent location and incredible house. as always, tommy was very responsive and easy to communicate with.the reservation was canceled 60 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.tommy, even though your house was on a steep hill in telegraph hill (and by the time you reached the top of the penthouse you needed a 5 minute rest) the home itself was amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\ntechnology everywhere... stunning views and an incredible location. i was unsure at staying in a suburban area, but you really do have it all right near the house, restaurants and easy access to union square, lombard street and fishermans wharf. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe loved san fran, and if we come back, we will be sure to stay again.... :)tommy\\'s place was fantastic and he was very easy to communicate with. we used his place to host our family from out of town and they were delighted at the quality of the amenities. the view is not half bad either!amazing space, with excellent furnishings and style. the first 10 minutes after walking in the door was just me saying \"whoa!\" and \"no way...\"  the view from the living room and deck is just the cherry on top. this place is a gem. we had a great experience and the pictures really don\\'t do it justice.  tommy was really easy to work with and would highly recommend this space to anyone. super place to stay, the terrasse and the view are just amazing, lots of place, and bathrooms ;-) \\r\\ntommy was a great host and responding to our request quickly!

our host tommy was very helpful and accommodating. there were plenty of linen and the kitchen was well stocked. the location was ideal with many restaurants and bars within walking distance. i will certainly be returning for a girls weekend soon. \\r\\nthank you tommy for your hospitality. comfortable rooms, great location, and truly amazing views from the living room and deck! my family and i really enjoyed our stay. everything was so convenient! we were within walking distance of tons of great restaurants, and also close to most of the major tourist attractions. we also decided to cook one night, and the kitchen was incredibly well-stocked with everything we could have asked for. terrific experience overall!the apartment was gorgeous with amazing views. the directions that tommy gave helped us find the place no problem. i wish we had more time so we could enjoy the gorgeous deck with great views. 6 of us stayed here and we were all very comfortable. thanks tommy!the space is amazing - incredible views, lots of room to spread out, an epic roof deck. it\\'s fully equipped and set up really well for visitors. the location is fantastic, right in the heart of north beach. tommy was flexible and worked to accommodate our schedule.tommy was very flexible and correct with us. we never met in person, but it was much easier this way for everyone. the flat is simply amazing. exactly as advertised. the neighbourhood is very cool adwell, everything is within walking distance.amazing experience and host. the apartment is amazing, great location and superb views. \\r\\ntommy was super friendly and helped us in every thing we asked.\\r\\ni\\'d certainly recommend and repeat.\\r\\ngreat place to stay to enjoy san francisco!i\\'ve had the opportunity to stay in some very neat places across the world, and i can honestly say that our stay at tommy\\'s penthouse is atop my list. san francisco itself is magical and is one of our favorite cities in the world. couple the san francisco awesomeness with the views that the penthouse provides and you get an experience that you will never forget. the north beach neighborhood has always been one of my favorites, so that was a bonus to tommy\\'s location. the property itself was incredible and as listed. communication with tommy was great throughout and getting into the penthouse was very simple. now, if only i could build a tiny house on the deck, i\\'d be 100% pleased!this penthouse is spectacular.  we had 6 adults; mom and dad and 2 \"20 something\" children and their friends.  we were very comfortable in the penthouse and really enjoyed the fabulous views from the rooftop deck and the kitchen and living area.  the 4 bathrooms were great, especially the master bath.  it was clean and well equipped.  we liked the neighborhood and walked or \"uber\"ed to a lot of the sights.  tommy helped us out with a parking spot for our car, he is very easy to work with.accurate listing and reviews - this place is great. upsides: lovely space with interesting contemporary art, lots of light, great views, great facilities, everything you need. easy check in and all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe neighborhood is terrific, corner groceries around for little stuff and terrific dining options just a few blocks away. some quirky stores and walkable to much of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nonly possible downside (and wasn\\'t for us but we\\'re walkers) is that it\\'s a lot of stairs and a lot of hills around the building.  be aware of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommended. nice house great views!  tommy was a fantastic host. the pictures don\\'t do this place justice. stayed here with 2 girlfriends the night before my wedding. it was so nice to be able to enjoy the space and the view with the two of them. would highly recommend and would stay at any of tommys properties. best air bnb experience yet!!the host canceled this reservation 273 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.tommy was very helpful and responsive to questions from us before and during our stay.  he graciously accommodated our requests to host 2 family parties the day before and day after our son\\'s wedding.  tommy has gone out his way to make sure that everything you might need is already in the apt.  the electronics are fantastic, the living spaces tastefully done and comfy, and the kitchen fully stocked with utensils and soft goods.  most importantly, the apt is in the north beach / telegraph hill area with tons of restaurants nearby, and well within walking distance.  the only downside is, the parking in the garage (for an extra charge) is very tight.  if the car next to you gets aggressive, it can make for difficult exit.  best to leave the escalade at homefor your visit to san francisco, this is the place!  we spent 4 nights here and really loved the place.  the upstairs living room and kitchen is a great room!  views are fantastic, and i spent several hours working from the kitchen on my computer, but really staring out the window!  \\r\\n\\r\\nit is nice that each bedroom has its own bathroom, and we really enjoyed the artwork and the overall look.  another highlight is the roof-top deck.  if it is nice weather (beautiful when we were there!), you\\'ll want to watch the sunsets from the roof.  it makes you feel like it is your city!\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m already making plans on when we can go back.\\r\\n\\r\\nmikethe host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. this is an automated posting.if you are planning on getting the full experience of san francisco, tommy\\'s penthouse is the best choice. the place is equipped perfectly with everything you can expect at a penthouse. it is comfortable, classy, and neat. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe greatest thing about the location is that so many delicious eateries are just a few block away from the house. \\r\\n\\r\\ni strongly strongly recommend this house to anyone who is planning on staying in sf.\\r\\n\\r\\ndouglas.this place is absolutely amazing! i live in sf, but in a different neighborhood, and did a girls getaway weekend here before my wedding. the views are incredible, the house is very large (by sf standards), and everything is clean and well-maintained. telegraph hill is a great neighborhood and is easily walkable. if i could move in, i would! highly recommended! thanks for a great stay! we used this place as a work retreat and it was perfect!!! the bedrooms were lovely, the deck was spacious and perfect, the kitchen was beautiful. we all wished our homes were as nice as this place :)as the photos show, thomas\\' penthouse is spacious, flooded with sunlight, furnished with some chic furniture and artwork, and has absolutely stunning views. the location could not be better and provides great (but strenuous) walkability to the waterfront, north beach, chinatown, coit tower, and fisherman\\'s wharf.  beds are comfortable and, aside from the neighbor\\'s 6:30am yowling cat, the home is quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat\\'s not apparent from the listing is that maintenance seems quite overlooked:  many missing or broken light switches, window shades and cranks, towel bars, problems with hot water and kitchen appliances...some are disclosed in the check-in manual, but collectively they give a feeling of shabbiness. this feeling was compounded by the terrible cleaning job (crusted food on counters and appliance handles, hair and dust bunnies everywhere) and the utility co. notice on the front door threatening to turn off water service for non-compliance.  \\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s also worth noting that the apartment would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues.  it\\'s located 100 feet down a charming but steep, unlit walking alley, and then up 3 flights of narrow interior stairs. not a problem at all for us, though, and of course this enables those great views.  the apartment was beautiful in the pictures, but upon arrival, things were sort of a disaster. there was a shirtless man in the living room vacuuming, and there was trash everywhere. i had arranged with out host that my group would be arriving around 7pm, but i don\\'t understand why the apartment wasn\\'t ready until 7:30pm. the house cleaner told me that the previous party hadn\\'t left until 3pm, which is sort of unacceptable given our check in was 3pm. what would have happened had we gotten in at 3pm?\\r\\n\\r\\naside from that, everything was fine. i just was annoyed that from the very beginning we had to deal with trash and a gross mess. i had a great stay with a group of 6 in this property. everything was super easy thanks to a well informed welcome guide and an easy check in and check out process. the property and its terasse  are gorgeous and perfectly located to discover any part of the city. the rooms and the common areas are large and well furnished making the time spent inside very enjoyable and convenient.wow! what a beautiful home. and the location is perfect. i loved walking to all the restaurants in the mission or down to dolores park to soak up the sun and see the \"sites.\" i didn\\'t get to meet him, but eric was a great host. i met his friend at the door to handover the keys and a quick tour of this very large house. only issues were that the area for ping pong table was a little tight, and the master bedroom was so bright and airy that i had trouble sleeping in past 9 so i had to go spend time with my family and see the sites of sf. \\n\\nthanks again eric for a lovely stay. nice home in a great location. our group of 8 people had a great trip to san fran and everyone loved this home. lots of space for gathering together to eat and play games. thanks for the great home. we used at seven for participants j-pop summit from japan.\\r\\nit sfo arrival was 20:00 only in the evening, but were able to enter as soon as contact eric friend.\\r\\nwhen you enter the house and was very happy to have cookies are pledged from eric friend.\\r\\nit is easy to spend a very big house. transportation is also good.\\r\\nit\\'s the second floor of the shower did not use it was regrettable. nothing no problem otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nis recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\neric & thank you for your friend.\\r\\nit was a fun san francisco 5 days.we had a great stay at eric\\'s home! it was very comfortable and had more than adequate space for our group. the house was also very well-located in the castro area - everything we needed was close by. in short, we had a good experience.this beautiful family house was a real home from home. ideally located in an area with good local shops and all the transport options on your doorstep. there is a big safeway supermarket just a short walk away. our hosts were very welcoming (although we didn\\'t meet them in person). they were very prompt at responding to all communications and were incredibly kind and helpful when my father had an accident while out sightseeing. the property has a great layout, with plenty of room for everyone. we found it to be ideal and loved our stay here.i had been pretty good hosted by darell during my few days in san francisco in darell\\'s flat. he is a nice and interesting guy, i really liked the few discussions we had.\\r\\nthe flat is well located downtown really close from the cable car ;)great guy darell! the place was comfy. we talked a lot about startups and meetups the time we could share together.great host, great home, great location! very positive experience --- vic was responsive/easy to get in touch with. house had the right balance of communal vibe and also a place to get work done. beautiful home with great views of the city from the various balconies. has everything you need including washer/dryer and classy kitchen, close to the shops/bars the groovy haight. interesting/good people in the home -- one night we did a massive dinner which was a blast (vic\\'s gf did most of the cooking). whole foods 15min walk. highly recommend for an authentic bay area experiencethe house is in a great location, everyone was so helpful, it really was well organised and was a great place to stay. i love this place. i feel so welcome and everything is so well organized. everyone is very kind and helpful. vic is the best host and i want to stay here every time i visit san francisco!\\r\\n\\r\\nvic is a great host. i enjoyed staying in this fantastic location. second time i\\'ve been to vic\\'s haight hackerhome and i was not disappointed. the neighbourhood is great, the house is great and vic does a great job caring for all his guests.wonderful hostel in one of sf\\'s best districts. the host was very welcoming and helpful and made sure we had everything we needed. the place is extremely cozy and the other guests where really friendly. will stay here again!fun atmosphere, really comfortable full sized bunk bed!

 she had stocked a section of her kitchen with food that we were welcome to use - breakfast cereal, fresh bread from the local bakery, tea, coffee, fruit, snacks - great!  she also had purchased slippers for our 2 young kids to wear around the house.  when she heard we would have our 1.5 yr old with us, she purchased a small crib that he could sleep in.  my wife and i were very surprised by this, as usually we have to rent cribs for our kids when on vacation.  suzy also had gave us lots of advice on things to do around the neighborhood, and in the city of san francisco.  \\r\\n\\r\\nsuzy\\'s house was exactly what we were looking for - 4 bedrooms, with plenty of space for everyone (we had 7 adults, and 2 kids, and the house could have slept more).  very well maintained and clean.  beautiful kitchen.  great location a block off gg park, and 1/2 mile from the beach.  all-in, a great place to stay!\\r\\n\\r\\ni would highly recommend staying at this property with suzy as host.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe description of the property was good. the neighborhood was fine. it ended up being further from downtown sf than i expected (30 mins). our stay at suzy\\'s home was an excellent experience! we arrived at 11 and the house wasn\\'t completely clean/ready, but that\\'s not her fault because checkin time is usually 3pm. when we returned later that afternoon, the house was completely clean and fully supplied with soap, shampoo, towels, blankets--you name it and she provided it.\\n\\nsuzy was so accommodating and excellent at communicating. her attentiveness exceeded my expectations for my first airbnb experience. everything advertised correctly. although it was expensive, it\\'s a great location in san fran and we stayed during super bowl weekend. i highly recommend suzy as a host!!!this is by far my favorite airbnb experience so far! raquel was so welcoming and hospitable; i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my stay. raquel provided everything we needed plus more; she even welcomed us with a bottle of wine and plenty of delicious snacks! i would definitely try to stay there again if i\\'m back in san francisco.\\n\\nthe carriage house is decorated in a warm and eclectic way; i loved how there were odd knick-knacks everywhere. there are also chickens and a rabbit to visit in the courtyard too. the place gave a homey vibe and i absolutely loved the property.raquel was very welcoming and helpful.  her house is an amazing place with an awesome yard and lots of quirky, fascinating decorations.  we had a wondedul time in exactly the neighborhood we wanted to be in. anita was super friendly and welcoming. her home was comfortable and clean. family friendly, close to transportation (bart) and highways.\\r\\nwould definiltey stay again. thank you!anita is lovely to work with - very responsive, thorough, and nice. the property is cute, rustic, and clean.anita was great - provided everything we needed. very clean and spacious home.anita was helpful and kind during the booking process.  the place itself is great and easily accommodated three guests.  cool, warm home with wonderful sf views!my trainees from my company needed a housing for a few months. anita\\'s place was perfect for them. even though there was a difficulty due to the cooperative renting (payment, process etc), anita helped me to proceed smoothly and i could not hope for the better communicator. \\r\\n\\r\\nshe welcomed the guests and they lived her house comfortably. \\r\\nthe house is located in very quiet and peaceful area and walk-distance from 24th mission which is very \"happening\" trendy spot.  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is very clean and the view is beautiful. \\r\\ni wish i could live instead of the trainees. \\r\\n\\r\\ni heard there was a nice music system in the living room from the trainees and they enjoyed dinner in the beautiful dining area with good music. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nif you like to sleep on hard ground, then this residence is for you. nice location, great view from  the deck. just make sure drain from the tub is working and make sure your 150 usd cleaning fee is used what it\\'s supposed to be for.we had a great stay at anita\\'s place! the house was spacious and fresh, and the terrace offered a fantastic view of the city. anita was very friendly and helpful and made us feel comfortable staying there.very nice house, with a grat view... we can see the top of golden gate bridge from the living room !\\r\\nwe were 5 and we have a lot of space. easy to park the car and very quiet even if we were very close from us 101 road.\\r\\nanita, was great, and we had a very nice stay.positives: \\r\\ngreat views over the city from the balcony, dining area & master bedroom.\\r\\nspacious, characterful accommodation\\r\\nwifi\\r\\nhillside supper club restaurant (highly recommended) within 10-12 mins walk\\r\\n\\r\\nnegatives:\\r\\nno shower - except if you are sitting in the bath!\\r\\nno washing machine or tv\\r\\ncar parking spaces in local area are keenly fought over\\r\\ndifficulty finding nearby shops to buy basics such as coffee, milk etc\\r\\nbeds on floor rather than divans - so nowhere to sit while getting dressedwe had a great experience with anita. she was very helpful when needed and was always pleasant to talk to.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is incredible and i\\'d recommend it to anyone coming to san francisco. my friends and i were obsessed with the view from the balcony and would always relax outside watching over the city. the shower takes some getting used to, but other than that the house is very nice to live in.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile the location is a bit of a ways to public transit like bart, it was certainly manageable. if you love mexican food, the proximity to 24th street is game changing, as the mexican restaurant scene is fantastic (esp. el farolito, a staple of my friends and i\\'s diet over the summer).anita was there when we arrived, gave a quick tour and then handed us the keys.  the house is fantastic. the pictures don\\'t do it justice.  the neighborhood is great.  had a comfortable stay.anita\\'s house is absolutely gorgeous, the pictures really don\\'t do it justice. as you walk in to the open concept living/dining area on the first floor you can see the most beautiful view of the whole of san francsico through the back windows. though its a short walk to our fav neighbourhood in the city, the mission, we spent a lot of time at home on the back porch absorbing the lovely scenery. the check in was easy, the kitchen is filled with lots of basic amenities for cooking at home, and the bedrooms were comfortable and clean. would love to rent this house again, thanks anita! we had a great stay at anita\\'s place! this was my first time using airbnb and couldn\\'t have had a better experience. our group of six loved this bernal heights gem! really convenient location, with easy uber access to the mission and beyond (easy access to 101 and 280 freeways). absolutely gorges apartment and neighborhood. highly recommend! the host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.we were not pleased with the choice very nice place. great space, even with three buddies in the house. anita even had the place ready before our 1pm check in. only negative was the bath tub without a shower, but we knew that going in. would highly recommend staying here while in sf.house is very cosy. its well maintained and beautiful. i would like to book this accomodation in future if i am visiting sf.anita\\'s place was perfect- the views over the city are breathtaking, especially from the terrace. the house was tidy and wonderfully furnished. i\\'d have no hesitations in recommending this place to friends and will definitely try to book it again once i return.the host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.thanks for everything sid & brian! i appreciated being able to arrange a wonderful stay for my co-worker! \\r\\nbest regards~ barbara\\r\\n\\r\\nbelow is the review from joe, one of our senior sales team members visiting sf/working in our mountain view office from az:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"if you need an awesome place in san francisco and sid has availability i\\'d suggest you grab the room now and look no further.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'d say it was more of a hotel-like experience in one of the best neighborhoods in the city.  \\r\\n\\r\\nsid was out of town, but his roommate brian was great.  he asked whenever i saw him if i needed anything and stacked clean towels/water bottles in my room almost daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nplace is super clean with an amazing view - why are you still reading this and not booking?\"sid was incredibly welcoming and accommodating. his place is beautiful and very close to many awesome cafes and bars. the views are incredible and he even took us up to the roof one day. i can\\'t recommend his place enough. i don\\'t know when we\\'ll end up staying at his place again, but if we could we would stay there all the time!sid\\'s apartment was fantastic and in a great location, just a stones throw away from north beach, chinatown, fisherman\\'s wharf, attractions around lombard and the cable cars. it\\'s very easy to explore the city from here. at night it\\'s quiet with hardly any noise for its location close to all of these attractions.\\r\\n\\r\\nsid was a great host. easy going and happy to help if he could, nothing seemed to be too much trouble. check out his resto recommendations. i wouldn\\'t hesitate to stay here again.our stay at sid\\'s couldn\\'t have been any better! the views from every room are magnificent. because of the building\\'s location on the edge of russian hill and building height limits in the area, there are no obstructions to seeing many of sf\\'s landmarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nsid himself is a spectacular guest. as a host myself, sid has raised the bar. he\\'s happy to go out of his way to provide rides, phone chargers, or anything else you need to make your stay great.we found the room to be clean and location to be fantastic. sid\\'s flat mates were more than accommodating with any questions in his absence. \\nthe only negatives in our experience is that the other rooms in this apartment are also leased which does mean that we experienced new travelers daily who we\\'re not always quiet at 3:00am when your trying to sleep.\\nif your happy to share this apartment as an upmarket backpackers then this place is for you.\\nsid\\'s communication and care factor could\\nnot have been better.all around awesome guy. highly recommended.sid\\'s place was great - convenient location, large room and bathroom, and great hosting from sid and brian.as a first time airbnb user, i was pleasantly surprised with my experience at sid\\'s. he really does take care of his guests and definitely helped to make my quick trip to san francisco a success! his apartment is in a perfect location for all tourist spots and the penthouse views are truly amazing. he is a genuinely nice person and i would absolutely stay here again!while sid himself was away when i stayed in bret harte terrace, his flatmate brian went out of his way to help me get to grips with the crazy hilly beauty that is san francisco. not only did he pick me up at midnight from the airport - and find me a lift with another lovely airbnber all the way to palo alto on my last day in the city - but he was extremely helpful, just generally giving directions and helping me find my feet after landing.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe room itself is huge with a private bathroom which includes two sinks and an actual bath - bliss! sid had left towels and mini toiletries out for me to use, and the bright window looks out on the street with a view of coit tower, which is especially pretty at night. natalia and the other people staying at the apartment were also lovely and while i chose to opt for an early night, i know brian took them all out on the town on saturday, yet there wasn\\'t a sound when they came in later that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nas for the apartment, it\\'s in a brilliant location; it\\'s not far from the classic lombard street and its famous curves, as well as having pier 39 and the rest of the wharf,  ghirardelli square and the powell-mason cable car line all within easy walking reach. i walked home alone from the wharf and from pistos tacos on grant & green with friends over the few nights i stayed there, and felt safe walking around even after dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only thing i was slightly surprised by was the lack of a key to the bedroom (though as this was my first airbnb experience, this may be the norm and i just wasn\\'t aware of it). all in all, bret harte terrace was a brilliant base from which to explore san francisco and i just hope i get to go back soon! thanks a million guys / go raibh míle maith agaibh :)excellent. from start to finish. sid and his girlfriend were really friendly and made sure i felt comfortable and at home at every opportunity. they even picked me up from the airport! the room is fantastic. large, spacious and has a full bathroom as well. this experience was better than staying in a hotel by a long way. the bed is phenomenally comfortable and the view is absolutely beautiful. location is close to pretty much everything and in one of the nicest, safest neighbourhoods in san francisco.sid is a great host; and goes out of his way (literally; he even picks you up at the airport!) to make sure you are comfortable and feel welcome. the location of the property is very convenient; with multiple restaurants and shopping venues in easy walking distance.this is an amazing spit in sf. the view alone is superb. the place is great and feels very comfortable. the location is a gem. sid was easy to coordinate with. i\\'d easily recommend it to a friend! wonderful host, beautiful view, clean and simple decor, great wifi, fabulous location.fabulous. stayed three times so see my other review.we recently stayed in sid\\'s apartment. it is as described. wonderful views in a great\\r\\nlocation! we didn\\'t meet sid but he was in constant contact to address any questions or concerns. this was my first time using airbnb and it was a great find. sid is soooo sweet, and his tommy is also sweet. even though he is not at his house, he made everything done smoothly. i really felt at home while staying in sid\\'s house.sid was incredibly accommodating and welcoming. his place was very clean and comfortable with gorgeous views. the location was excellent and it was easy to enjoy everything sf had to offer right outside of sid\\'s door. 10/10. will definitely stay here again!sid\\'s place was amazing. clean, nice location, amazing view. i highly recommend this apartment !great experience at sid\\'s place. stunning view, very confortable mattress, perfect location. although i had only a short visit, by the time i left i felt as if i had known him for years.  the apartment has a second-to-none views of the san francisco bay and sid\\'s hospitality matches the view.  the master bedroom is large, comfortable and clean.  sid driving me to the airport was an added treat.sid and marie were very hospitable.  we got a thorough tour of the apartment.  they had a well stocked refrigerator of food and beverages available to us.  our bed was very comfortable, the room was clean and the view was very nice.  the en suite was clean and well stocked with supplies.   we enjoyed an evening on the cozy patio.  the photos and description were all as we anticipated.  sid was even so generous as to transport us to and from the airport!  what service!absolutely loved staying here.  the house is incredible.  it manages to be spacious yet cozy and comfortable at the same time.  \\r\\none of the best things about this place is that it is an entire home - and it feels that way!  much different feel than an apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nit has 3 levels.  the bottom has a beautiful bedroom, bathroom, and mini living room (or third bedroom with a fold out couch), then you come up to the main floor where you have the kitchen and incredible living room and dining room, both equipped with tall ceilings and skylights.  i didn\\'t cook while i was here, but that\\'s only because i already had dinner plans.  the kitchen is inspiring.  \\r\\nthat brings us to the top floor.  the master bedroom is beautiful and has plenty of light and an absolutely incredible view of the city.  oh, and did i mention the bathroom?  it\\'s awesome.  jacuzzi tub for 2, and a separate lovely shower.\\r\\n\\r\\ni saved the best for last (though everything was awesome, so it\\'s hard to say for sure...), the back yard.  it is beautifully tiered and landscaped with a gorgeous view of the city.  we hung out back there at night and enjoyed the lights and built in seating and general awesomeness of it all.\\r\\n\\r\\ni can\\'t say enough good things about this house and about the host.  mark was quick to respond to my inquiry, was helpful with all my questions, and just had the knack for making me feel welcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nhighly recommend!the place was excellent. it was huge and offered me a private area to stay. i had a separate entrance, bathroom and laundry area (which i didn\\'t use but might be convenient if i had a longer trip). the house was bright and unique and like i said very private. i didn\\'t need to see mark at all if i didn\\'t want to but when i met him he was a great guy so we sent a bit of time together.  mark is super friendly and knowledgable about the city. he is an artistic and intelligent guy and a phenomenal host. i would strongly recommend staying at his place if you are ever in san francisco. we had an amazing family gathering trip to sf @ this house.  it was 9 of us, including a 6 y/o kid and a couple of teens.  plenty of space and amenities.   mark and his girlfriend where spotless in their handling of the reserve.  they received us personally at the house, showed us around and made us feel like they where legitimately eager to host us.   the premises are better in person than in pictures.  the neighborhood is very charming and close to public transportation.   i would recommend this please to anyone to the extent i would love to stay there again.mark\\'s house was unreal. amazing house. tons of room and surreal views. carolina showed us around and even got us a bottle of champagne, which was very thoughtful. all in all we had a fantastic time and can\\'t recommend marks place enough. hope to make it back to sf soon.mark was an absolutely extraordinary host. our accommodation was very last minute as the venue we booked for a ceremony dinner cancelled last minute. we emailed him the day he was flying out. not only did he save our weekend by accommodating us but he also had the house spectacularly clean and ready upon our arrival. he was consistent with communication and details and was an extremely responsive host. the house is beautiful, inviting and open, the backyard is really big with an amazing view. it really feels like a get away in nature in the middle of noe valley. we want to thank mark for being amazing and making the weekend even more special for burcum and garrett.mark was a fantastic host for our visit to san francisco. we were in town for a birthday/reunion trip of 7 friends, and mark\\'s place made for a perfect setting for the occasion. he was incredibly responsive from the moment we corresponded about the booking, even before it was confirmed. it was a lot of pressure to find the perfect location for 7 people, so he helped me feel confident that i had made the right choice and we were in good hands!\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we arrived at the house, we found that everything was exactly as advertised. we were fortunate to have a very sunny weekend and the house has plenty of light - beautiful!

and i mean it! the rooms are nice and clean. their pets are fun. would stay with them anytime again!thanks for a great time at the pow house. \\r\\nwe stayed for two nights at this fantastic house, with a great view towards the city. the girls were quite helpful, and came with lots of tips if what to to during our stay. the house looks exactly like in the pictures. and it was great fun to talk with the girls in the evening over a cold beer.\\r\\nregards \"the real vikings from norway\"this is another classic airbnb experience: christine was there with a friend, while julie and ginger were away on vacation. there was also a lovely couple from sweden in the other bedroom, our host\\'s dog, the friend\\'s dog, and the host\\'s cat, who was as friendly as most dogs. breakfast is included in the cost, and since i like to cook breakfast that was a big plus. raided their fridge, but not excessively i hope, and kitchen was pretty easy to figure out without too much help. can\\'t praise christine enough. if airbnb did not exist, it would have to be invented as a way for christine to express her openness, optimism, and warmth. i really felt like an old friend. one of the best hosts ever. also, circumstances were such that she was able to accommodate a flexible check-in/out schedule -- not that you can count on it, but the point is she was in a position to help and did. and she responded to my initial request in about an hour or less -- which mattered because another host had just cancelled on me 36 hours before my flight, and many before that had been unresponsive after 24 hours. so thank you for saving the day, christine! the house works well, especially the dc comics bedroom which was big, had plenty of room to hang my clothes, and had a shared bath with the swedish couple, which worked fine since they kept slightly different hours than i did. there is also a great view of the bay bridge and parking if you want it. the common space was not exactly as pictured, but just off camera was an area with three glass-top desks and i found that to be a comfortable place to work when the hosts were not there -- which was often, since they no longer work out of the apartment (probably better for this biz trip since i would have gotten zero work done with them around, i think :). one issue with this house: it is in a real suburban location way south of the ballpark, so if you want to step in and out for a cup of coffee, a jaunt on a cable car, or a quick visit to a nearby museum, this is not the place. i tend to like a more central location to retreat to between meetings and sightseeing. on the other hand, the swedish couple had it all figured out: they were true tourists who loaded a light pack with maps etc for the day, left early, enjoyed the town, and then came back to crash. worked perfectly for them.lovely view and comfy room. great hosts for young traveler\\'s. thanks you!the pow house was a great experience as a first time user of airbnb. it was very clean and had a beautiful view of the bay area. i think the best thing that i experienced was the company of the pets emma, cici, and booboo.since ginger was mostly busy with work, we had the chance to talk to julie and christine the most.it was definitely a great place to stay in san francisco and i would love to stay there again. fantastic experience. ginger, christine, julie are very nice and friendly. room is extreme clean. i would go back for next visiting to sf   the pow!!! house was as advertised...roomy living area, tidy.  the private bedroom for our family of four was suitable for our purposes (out most the day sightseeing, living area in morning/evening, bedroom for sleeping).  our hosts were very friendly.  a very good experience as newbies to airbnb accommodations... :-)superb place to stay if your visiting san francisco. the room is nice and clean with a very comfy bed!! christine, ginger and julie are all fantastic people. me and my friends had a great time here and i would definately reccommend. my party and i really enjoyed ourselves at the pow house. the images are very accurate and it feels just like home! christine was very helpful and responded to our needs via text whenever we needed assistance. their home was very beautiful and it made our experience in san francisco very worthwhile. the neighborhood was very quiet, which was great since we needed to escape from the busy streets at night. i would highly recommend staying here if you are ever to visit san francisco!fantastic stay at pow house! even a staying of 3days i can really affirm that\\'s hosts are all nice, friendly and helpfull. they made many great suggestions during our staying.i love this house and the cat and the dog,three girls are so friendly and beautiful.我爱你们!the house was great and the neighborhood was quiet. there was even an awesome view of san francisco from the street. the check-in process was smooth and the house was very clean. they even mailed me by watch when i forgot it on a side table!we enjoyed our stay. the bedroom was clean. we weren\\'t at the house very much except to eat breakfast/ go to sleep and only had a very brief interaction with one of the hosts. the cat was pretty loud on the second night until the early am with no owner(s) present. being allowed to do laundry at the house was very nice.we loved staying at the pow!!! house. :) they did an awesome job making us feel welcome. the beer and chocolate was yummy and the bed was super comfy. our hosts were welcoming and very helpful.  my friends were from switzerland and had never been to the u.s.a.  they had pamphlets and tour books for us to plan our day trips into the city.  it was challenging to park but everything else was great!the hosts are awesome!  very welcoming and will feed you too! the place was so beautiful and clean  super fantastic view from the patio.  great place and good location.overall a nice experience staying in this pow house.  the host is very responsive to my queries, as well as the welcoming lovely cat.  with permission i had a cup of milk there.  one area of improvement is that the matt in the shared toilet was too wet to step on.   uber driver was easy to access so transportation to city centre is not an issue at all.ginger, christine and julie were very welcoming host. the house was clean and the room perfect. nice site in the city, next to the muni metro to move in the town easily. there is free parking next to the house. it was really nice, thank you very much !hi,pow girls,you are so awesome,we feel comfortable the three days,thanks for the staying in your home.you are so lovely.i hope to meet you again!thank you so much everything was perfect! the girls are so friendly and nice! the part of the neighborhood where the house is felt really safe, but i wouldn\\'t walk up there from 3rd street on nights. during the day it looked very safe. \\nthe house was clean, easy to find! \\noverall it was a great experience!it was a great experience to stay at the pow house. ginger is very smart and very warm person. i felt like home. \\r\\n\\r\\nwill definitely recommend everyone to stay in this comic characters themed house.\\r\\nmy mother and i had a wonderful time at \\'the pow!!!

ginger, christine and julie were very friendly and helpful. we particularly enjoyed the lovely animals too :) i would definitely recommend staying here.the girls were super nice! we felt very welcomed & accommodated. instructions on how to get the key and the code for the door were very clear. they were also helpful with restaurants to eat around the area and other areas to check out! i definitely recommend staying here :) the house is located in a quiet area and there are a lot of places for street parking, which is great in sf. the inside of the house is really beautiful. the host is really nice. she introduces the nearby good restaurants to us and also offers us with board games to play. we stay there for two nights, really enjoy the friendly and relaxing atmosphere.   it was really nice place to stay. house is well organized, clean, easy to use. thank you for hosts to provide this good placewe could enjoy this house.\\r\\nat first day, we made some mistake about their house. it was our fault, but they were so kind.\\r\\nthank you so much, pow guys.great hosts - especially for my first time using airbnb.  all the directions were clear and concise, and the space was perfect.  wish i had been around more often, but would definitely re-book again!not a great experience for me and my friends. overpriced for the size and location (not a safe neighborhood and not walkable). we shared one bathroom with 4 other people who left chicken out in their room unrefrigerated overnight (smelly), there was no coffee or breakfast food as stated in the description, people slept in the common area which made it awkward in the mornings and we came home one day afternoon to the front gate and door wide open with no one home (not safe).\\r\\n\\r\\ni do not recommend staying here.my stay at the pow house was amazing!! the hosts were very nice and accommodating. the room was very spacious and clean. it got pretty cold at night so i put a quilt that was in the closet on top of the comforter for more warmth. the kitchen is open to use. they have a whole pantry for tea and coffee. if you have a car, there\\'s plenty of street parking. just make sure to look at the signs for the street cleaning hours. there are dogs here and they\\'re very nice. i can\\'t recommend these guys enough. they\\'re the best!!great place to stay near the san francisco area!

their home was very clean and comfortable, the bedroom opened up to a lovely patio! gil and mari took time to chat and give us suggestions on what to do and eat around town and left us lovely bread and freshly made marmalade for breakfast!!

it was a relief for me, being a new driver.\\r\\nadditionally, there is a small bar at the end of the street that is so great, that we were able to walk easily too. in addition to this, we were surrounded by many good stores. i can\\'t express enough how much we loved this apartment!the house was good and the host was responsive. we mentioned the wifi was spotty and shortly after a new access point was installed. great host!vlad\\'s place was great! our visiting documentary crew was very very comfortable (and thankful) to be in such a great neighborhood which was close to all the places they needed to be. the home was clean, comfortable and roomy.  in addition, the location was perfect being only walking distance from plenty of good food and bars.   lastly, vlad was extremely responsive to questions.  overall, great experience! everything was great during my stay. \\r\\nthe neighborhood is beautiful, the house is big, good and clean.\\r\\ni recommend.the apartment was clean and spacious. we enjoyed staying at the apartment.  spent a few days in sf on a work trip and this apartment was perfect. location was great. communication on point. rooms + living space were spotless. it\\'s not the type of apartment that blows you away with charm as i do think it is primarily used for airbnb. however, if you want a great place to lay your head at night in a perfect location... this is it.great location, great house to tay.charming comfortable place about 5 minutes from the mission. was better than described and amanda made us feel very welcome (even left some breakfast items).amanda\\'s property was beautiful and our stay was quite pleasant. i especially liked the well appointed bathroom and the inspirational view from the back yard. as someone who is not used to the hills of san francisco, parking on the steep streets was a little worrisome, but we were able to cope. i would certainly recommend amanda\\'s apartment to anyone staying for a couple days in san francisco.the appartment was like described on the site.\\r\\nwe were surprised to be welcome in the owner\\'s home but everything was perfect. very nice and personnal. \\r\\nwonderful view and i apreciated the terrasse, the garden and the humming birds who came to drinki the fontain...\\r\\nsome difficuties to get the last arrangement informations due to my difficulties to connect internet.\\r\\namanda was super to try to help us and once i got the info we were very happy.\\r\\nthe host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.a good experience with airbnb. the apartment is lovely and amanda is very nice. we had a stay there.very cordial and comfortable setting. had trouble starting the tv, probably age related and tech deficiency. wifi and coffee grinder with coffee beans.  muffin for breakfast. amanda was very helpful and friendly. the apartment is cosy with great views and good outdoor space. would recommend to anyone, but be mindful it is on a very steep street if car parking or walking. close to bus route and train station.great host! quiet neighborhood in a great location. she was also great at responding back to any issues we were having, also checking up on us as well. will definitely recommend to friends! thanks for having me, adventure house! ll miss the low activation energy to social interaction (:we loved shannon\\'s (url hidden) immaculate victorian in a centralized \\'hood in the mission. shannon was very responsive and offered many tips for eating and seeing. he left us a bottle of wine too :) his house is close to four barrel, tartine, bar tartine, bi-rite - you really couldn\\'t ask for a better location.\\r\\nhis house was perfectly clean and well equipped. the bed in the room was crazy-comfy and the air mattress was actually more comfortable than my bed at home!!! i have not one complaint about the house or my experience in dealing with shannon. i woud recommend staying there in a heart-beat. do it!we stayed at shannon\\'s flat over a long weekend. it was a perfect location for us. central to most things one would need for a getaway in san francisco. best coffee, food, grocery, cocktails and transportation was just a few steps away. the flat was sunny, neat, clean, spacious and comfortable with all amenities expected from a vacation rental. and it was surprisingly very quite as it was tucked away from the busy streets; though the n\\'hood is bustling with desirable activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe spent most of our time being out and about, but with full kitchen and dining area this is an ideal stay if we wanted to stay in with takeaway dinner and a bottle of wine. \\r\\n\\r\\nshannon was great in connecting with us quickly with clear information about his availability, flexibility and provided us with clear instructions in using the flat. he was available whenever we needed him on the phone. he was kind and met us at the other end of the town to give us the keys and instructions. (we were at an an earlier appointment). thank you!i have rented many san francisco properties using airbnb but shannon’s house is now my favorite for a few reasons. first, the value is excellent compared to other options. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe central location is ideal. it’s within walking distance to castro, mission, and steps away from market street. don’t worry about excessive street noise/traffic, as it is on a relatively quiet side street. i prefer this location to the frequently chaotic union square area.\\r\\n\\r\\ni also found it very spacious, clean, and tastefully furnished. finally, shannon was super helpful and considerate during the booking process and throughout my stay.shanon\\'s apartment was very clean, good location near mission district and transportation. the place was extremely comfortable, great master bedroom mattress and lots of hot water and pressure in the shower, comfortable sofa and extremely bright, sunny apartment.  great coffee and kitchen layout, although we didn\\'t cook. shannon made the stay really easy, was super responsive, gave great tips for the neighborhood and made it like staying at a nice hotel. the house was gorgeous and located ideally near market and mission/dolores. shannon was courteous, kept in contact and welcomed us with everything we needed. we were provided with suggestions on what to do in the neighbourhood, bars, food and recreational haunts abound!\\r\\n\\r\\nit even had an apple tv, which honestly was the best thing about the place for a techie like me.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou\\'ll love this place!i\\'ve visited in san francisco six times over the past year for business and staying at shannon\\'s was by far the most enjoyable experience so far. the location is great being close to everything, but removed enough to still feel peaceful. the apartment itself is huge and extremely well presented.\\r\\n\\r\\ni will definitely try to stay here next time i\\'m in san francisco.what a great place/location!  great communication and host could not be nicer.\\r\\n\\r\\nthank you!\\r\\ncorywe stayed 5 days in this apartment with 3 friends of mine and we had a great time ! shannon is a perfect host and provided us with a lot of advice. the apartment is clean, extremely quiet and well furnished. location is also very convenient to discover the city. well, i would definitely recommand shannon\\'s place !shannon was a dream host leaving fresh flowers for our stay. an absolute dream apartment with lovely fresh sheets, like staying in a hotel. fantastic apartment - great location on a charming block, very clean, lots of natural light and modern decorating, comfortable bed and super soft sheets.  shannon left us tons of delicious snacks and breakfast items, which was very nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe location in the heart of mission was great, with easy accessibility to downtown.  the guide shannon leaves with restaurant and cafe recommendations was also helpful. we\\'d definitely return.what a find!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment exceeded our expectations in every department. it is of a good size and furnished to a high standard throughout. it\\'s obvious that the owner is very proud of his property and takes very good care of it. we were particularly impressed by the little touches such as some groceries left for us and fresh flowers as well. we were very comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe arrived late in the day at sfo and it was great that the property could be very easily and quickly reached via bart and then a v-short taxi ride, we had no problems finding the property and letting ourselves in before a quick meal round the corner and then collapsing into a v-comfy bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is very conveniently located with extremely good transport links, something that people new to s.f should take into consideration. there are brilliant dining/shopping options within easy walking distance in a neighbourhood that gave us no concerns. whilst it\\'s a little way from the really big tourist sites these are all easily accessible via tram etc and a big part of the attraction is that this property is away from all the tacky touristy places which were certainly not our scene and it\\'s thus very easy to get a feel for the real s.f from this property.\\r\\n\\r\\nshannon, the owner, has been extremely helpful throughout and has made the whole process very straightforward especially as i had some reservations not having used airbnb before. he provided very helpful hints, tips and info about the locality.\\r\\n\\r\\nall in all this made our recent trip to s.f extremely pleasurable.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe\\'d wholeheartedly recommend this propertythis is an absolutely amazing apartment to stay at. not only for the light and spacious feeling of the interior but the location is also perfect . mark was an exceptional host providing fresh towels and linen regularly over my visit. i have already passed this apartment onto other friends as well and will be back there again myself. \\n\\nthank you mark. my wife and i stayed here for our wedding anniversary and we had a blast. the place does have quite a bit of sunlight and is very relaxing. it\\'s also in a historic neighborhood with plenty of things to do in the area. \\r\\nshannon was awesome - this was our first time airbnb experience and he made it 5 stars. very flexible and accommodating - i had zero issues. shannon has impeccable taste and takes pride in his place and it shows! shannon was the most fantastic host. his home is gorgeous, clean and in a wonderful location and he went above and beyond as a host-far better than other members i\\'ve corresponded with in helping me with some air bnb technical support issues, directions, what to do, restaurants to check out and providing us with wonderful amenities. he was great about checking in with us to make sure our stay was pleasant. i will recommend his home to friends and family and i hope we are able to book his home again on our next visit. our trip was fantastic. this  apartment was amazing!:\\n- exceptionally clean\\n- well provisioned\\n- great location, very quiet\\n- very good heater for when it got cold and rained\\n- nice and secure\\n- appreciated the little reminders on post-its throughout\\n- great knowledge from shannon on everything - local amenities, the weather, flights, the show - everything\\n\\ngreat place and highly recommended - from tink & ali :) \\nshannon was a fantastic host, incredibly responsive and accommodating. his house was an absolute delight. we arrived to beautiful flowers and a selecting of treats and a very clean house. this house is amazing, very quite, bright and private. we will for sure stay here again in the future should the need arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nshannon is wonderful!

first off - shannon was an amazing host! the home was absolutely lovely from the beautiful hardwood floors to the fresh flowers in every room. shannon took care of every single detail in preparing for our arrival. \\r\\n\\r\\nwe had 3 people who each needed a separate bed and even though there were only 2 beds originally, shannon went out of his way to purchase an additional bed for our 3rd guest!! wow!! \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we arrived (late that evening) we found that the hot water was not working - but it seriously didn\\'t matter - shannon was up early the next morning checking the hot water heater and doing everything he could to get the company out there asap to fix it. they did and it was perfect the rest of the stay. \\r\\n\\r\\npearl street is the perfect location!

(and, in my opinion, nothing beats the promptness and convenience of bart in sf). no matter which direction you pick from the house - north, east, west or south - you will have a fantastic walk, from sightseeing point of view and a general ambience of the city. the area is infested with restaurants that will suit anyone’s taste. and if feels like there is some sort of happening everyday there ‘cause any day of the week they’re all packed. the bi-rite market is one of the best i’ve shopped. it’s a pure pleasure to bring fresh produce and cook at home kitchen or just sit at the table with the spread of berries, cheese and wine. if you like cats, you’ll be pleased to find yourself in the company of the most two friendliest cats who make you feel so much more at home. dan’s place was definitely one of the highlights of our stay in san francisco. thank you dan and kat!dan and kat were such great hosts, we could not have asked for a better place to home base while exploring the city.  the mission is a fantastic neighborhood, and they had great recommendations on places to eat, drink, and see.   the fresh produce and eggs were an added treat!  would absolutely recommend this to anyone heading to sf.the house is very cute and nice.\\r\\ndan and kat welcomed us very warmly  as ouzo and chef, their two adorable cats, the place is quiet and well located in mission dolores, near a beautiful park. and if you want to go downtown, just take the tramway on market street near by there.\\r\\nbesides, we had fresh eggs everyday from the chickens in the garden, yummy-yummy!\\r\\nwe had a fantastic journey in san francisco, thanks again guys, we\\'ll definitely go back to your place next time!\\r\\nkat and dan were wonderful. the home is well located, very comfortable and we\\'ll-appointed. i\\'m not sure this would be a good choice for two couples--the two larger bedrooms are separated only by sliding doors.  with hardwood floors throughout, there is little \"sound\" privacy in the place.kat and dan were fantastic hosts. they provided lots of helpful tips about the neighborhood as well as bike rides my husband could do. their home is very lovely and well located, we had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. would gladly go back!we were very happy to stay here. we were with 3 people visiting for 3 nights and this house is located well for visiting sf. nice restaurant around the corner, clean and cozy. would definitely recommend this house for people visiting sf.we were not one bit disappointed with the property. it was just as pictured and clean. the beds were very nice and fresh smelling. our hosts were helpful with anything that we needed. i would recommend staying at this here. the location was just wonderful for a visit to san francisco.hi, daniel\\'s house was perfect for our group of 6 people!

\\r\\n\\r\\nwe used dan\\'s kitchen to cook meals multiple times.  big money saver to be able to throw together a quick breakfast or lunch and not have to buy 3 meals out per day.  the kitchen is gorgeous and equipped with everything you could possibly need.   we also used the washer/dryer- great perk over hotels and other spots!\\r\\n\\r\\nwould love to use dan\\'s home again when returning to san francisco and highly recommend this location to visitors.  very happy with the entire package.  thank you, dan! daniel was very responsive and welcoming, both in the booking process and while we were there. the apartment is big and sunny, and the neighborhood is fantastic. lots of nice restaurants nearby, and just a couple of blocks from the bart and the muni. highly recommended!daniel\\'s home was exactly as described. it was spacious with a great location. it was surprisingly well stocked with just about anything one would need, e.g.: clean towels, shampoo, body wash, all possible cups (wine, champagne, mugs, etc.), every possible pan and cookware, every spice, flour, oil, and misc cooking supplies, silverware and plates, and so much more.\\r\\n\\r\\ni needed a pair of scissors, and found one within 5 seconds of searching!\\r\\n\\r\\ndaniel was very helpful and quick/responsive with all of our misc questions. one of my most comfortable airbnb stays... simply perfect. truly, sincerely, thank you for having us.great spot. great neighborhood. this was perfect for our trip. close proximity to the bart, comfortable accomodations, and a great location. this was my first booking with airbnb.  we found the experience so relaxing in comparison to hotels and we welcomed the space in your home - fantastic location close to so many wonderful restaurants and coffee shops.  with thanks kerrydaniel\\'s apartment was perfect.  great location, easy and convenient to access, clean.  best for 3-4 people, but it slept 6 of us comfortably.  plenty of clean towels and linens provided, as well as good info on the neighborhood.  would definitely stay again.  thanks daniel!we had a lovely time in the house.  it was a really good fit for a group of three.  we were there to work hard, so having a good kitchen mattered.  the proximity to a lot of good neighborhood features was a plus: grocery stores about a 3 minute walk; bart about a 5 minute walk.  i also found that just walking around to other spots in the area was easy.  overall, this is a good fit if you need the space.  this is a lovely place in a really great neighborhood. check-in and check-out were very easy, the place was well appointed with towels, pots and pans, kitchen basics. bedrooms were together at the front of the place and the kitchen/living room area at the back so those who are awake don\\'t disturb those who are still abed. i will definitely try to stay here again next time i\\'m in san francisco. we had a bunch of people coming to stay in the city for a week and needed a place for them. dan was wonderful. his instructions were incredibly clear and it was so easy to check in and out. he was great, his place was wonderful, everyone enjoyed themselves immensely!we spent a week in daniel\\'s house and enjoyed coming home to its warm atmosphere and the vibrant neighborhood. the house is within 5-10 minutes walk to bart and muni stops, and close to the wholefoods and subway supermarkets. the kitchen was well-equipped - we cooked several times - and other appliances, the washing machine and dishwasher, oven and microwave, made our stay very comfortable. especially the beds were in good shape, with soft linnen. daniel was always very quick in responding to our questions, and we thank him and his wife for making our stay this nice. the location is very good, near to anywhere downtown. we had a very sweet and relaxing vacation in this house, 4 of us are all very satisfied.we stayed at dan\\'s house for 3 nights. the house was very comfortable, cosy, and well equipped. the location is great, close to many nice restaurants, cafes and supermarkets. its also in a walking distance to a park. \\n\\nwe rent a car during our stay and it was not too difficult to find a parking space close to the house.\\n\\nwe met dan and his wife when we arrived and they gave us a warm welcoming. it was a bit difficult for us to open the lock box but dan responded very quickly and got it changed for us right away.\\n\\nall in all, it was a great stay and we will definitely stay here again.dan & his wife were perfect hosts.  easy to communicate with and friendly.  the place was clean with adequate supplies and a great location next to restaurants and shops.  would definitely recommend staying there.check-in and rules of the house were easy/straightforward. location is excellent in the mission area of sf [walking distance or $7-8 uber rides to most food/coffee spots we wanted to check out. $21 to crissy field / ghirardelli square. $30+ to oakland airport. ]  everything we needed was provided (coffee, bath towels, clean sheets). the place was very clean, had great kitchen appliances, and fast internet! you can hear neighbors get up to go to work through the walls/ceiling but it is only for a few seconds at a time and not really a bother. the one-bathroom is split into a toilet & shower/sink area which really helps when you have several people staying there. overall a great experience and would definitely stay there again or recommend it to friends!the house is in a very good location with lots of restaurants, cafes and markets within walking distance. my group and i were there for 5 days and picked up groceries at whole foods, which is less than a 10 minute walk. we also went to a few restaurants nearby including mission beach café (great for brunch…get there early because it gets busy), little star pizza and tartine bakery & café.  the house was equipped with the essentials (coffee, bath towels, clean sheets). beds were comfortable and i liked that the shower and toilet are separated from each other. you can hear the neighbors walk up and down the stairs but it\\'s not too much of a bother. check-in/out was very easy too. i was able to coordinate with dan to arrive at an earlier time because my flight arrived early in the morning.we absolutely loved this place.  the apartment was beautifully decorated, the beds were comfortable, and we had everything we needed for a perfect stay.  check in was easy, too.  i would absolutely stay here again and probably will he next couple times my colleague and i are in sf.  the neighborhood is close enough to everything we wanted to do.  highly recommended.  ruth was an excellent host providing insider tips which allowed me to go to a couple of places i otherwise would not have. she responded very promptly and getting into the apt was easy. there are 2 living rooms and the bedroom is in between the 2 with ruth\\'s bedroom and the kitchen at the other end of the apt. i also was able to use the washer/dryer which was a very nice convenience. the apt is in a terrific location within walking distance of cafe\\'s, fantastic restaurants, yoga studios. also, was able to walk to the castro district and hayes valley.  thanks for a very nice stay!... nice room/house in a interesting, quite and safe neighbourhood with many hip (not too fancy) restaurants ... ruth was a perfect host ... her dog too lovely ... would highly recommend this place for a stay in sf ... ruth was fantastic! her place is absolutely gorgeous and in a perfect location, near bi-rite and faletti\\'s (two great grocery stores) and plenty of wonderful restaurants, not to mention public transportation. my mom declared her bed one of the most comfortable she\\'s ever slept on (and she\\'s quite picky!). moxie is such a sweetheart. my mom and i are both cat people and were pleasantly surprised when we found her to be one of the sweetest, gentlest dogs. very affectionate. like a huge cat! we couldn\\'t have asked for a better airbnb experience.my experience was lovely. ruth welcomed me into her home very last minute, which i appreciated greatly and everything was spotless and comfortable. her dog was very sweet - a total laid back and lovable creature! i highly recommend this stay and as a former resident of the neighborhood, i can\\'t rave about nopa enough. great location!i had a great time staying here for two weeks. the flat is indeed very stylish and looks just as it does in the pictures. the room is well-lit and the bedding is comfortable. the dog is amazing and she loves belly rubs!! the neighbourhood is quiet and safe and there are tons of restaurants and shops right around the corner. i\\'d love to stay here again.ruth was so great at the short notice she had to prepare the room for my arrival! the apartment is lovely and the bed extremely comfortable.  if you love or hate dogs moxie is a complete heartbreaker, the nicest dog i have met. only warning, as soon as she gets one belly rub she will want one hundred more! great neighbourhood with great coffee shops and restaurants just around the corner. would of course come back to see moxie!most comfortable place i know outside my own home.  if pillows are love, this place overflows with it. this place was amazing! the views from the roof top ( the bay bridge and down town) were incredible. everything was clean inside. great food and fun all within a few blocks. scott is a terrific host with afantastic  property and i would and probably will stay there again sometime!scott was an excellent host. we were greeted with a welcome note and a bottle of wine and coffee.  scott lives near by and it was very nice to meet him. he was attentive and answered all questions immediately. our stay was absolutely perfect. the house is spacious and the views are spectacular. the rooftop is amazing. the beds are very comfortable. i would love to stay here again. i was a little hesitant booking scott\\'s place since it was newly listed and didn\\'t have many reviews. wow am i glad i booked scott\\'s place. his place is absolutely stunning.  i stayed there with my two kids ages 21 and 24. everything was first class.  scott was very communicative, made sure we had everything and we were greeted with a bottle of wine and some chocolate (very nice). words can\\'t describe how beautiful the view is from the bedrooms and the upper deck. the roof top hot tub got plenty of use too. location is awesome. we walked to local cafe\\'s for breakfast, walked to pier 39 and also union square. each of these were about 1 mile from scott\\'s place. this is definitely the place to stay if your are going to be in san francisco. scott was an amazing host! he communicated with us prior to arrival, and as soon as we arrived he met us to help unload the car and find parking. he gave us a tour of the home, and welcomed us with wine, coffee, and chocolate! the location is amazing and the views from the upper deck are breathtaking. we appreciate scott\\'s hospitality and would definitely come back.scott was a wonderful host and the home is outstanding!  the views were unbelievable, but that is just a part of the charm of this home.   our family had a great time and had a welcoming home base to return to after our days of adventures.  coffee and pastries on the roof top deck with spectacular views! the host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.the host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. this is an automated posting.i wanted to stay someplace other than a hotel where i could cook if i wanted and feel a bit more \"at home\" in sf.  i absolutely picked the right place!  zoe has a beautiful place, perfect location, had everything i needed and more!  her cat is a perfect addition to your stay and is the best behaved kitty ever!  zoe was super easy to plan and talk to and is a generous host and made the whole trip perfect.  i will be staying at her place again and look forward to it!!

perfect location for us, so much to see, and nearby bus made getting to other parts of san fran easy. \\r\\n\\r\\nas a host zoe was a real hoot and went above and beyond in making recommendations, cooking us breakfast, and even taking us on an impromptu driving tour of san fran neighbourhoods on our last day there! even her cat rabbit made us feel like it was our home too, if only for a few days. \\r\\n\\r\\nbig thumbs up from us, anyone that stays here and/or with zoe will have an experience to remember...so where should i start... i stayed over and month with zoe! the flat was incredible! even better than the photos, better than home! great pieces of furniture,  very cosy couches and bed!  \\r\\nnow zoe! she is a fantastic person, to have fun, to talk to, i can\\'t even find an adjective that would express you what a great person she is!!!!\\r\\nno one should discover or stay in sf without zoe! \\r\\nthen there is rabbit, the cat. always cute, she is the ideal companion! you never feel lonely! \\r\\n\\r\\ni you are still looking at some different places to stay you can stop right now! you\\'ve found your place!

if you can get a place with her, you are very very lucky! loved it...already miss it...and, if you are allergic to cats (which i am) i can report that her cat rabbit, was not a problem, a very friendly, non-intrusive cat that for some miraculous reason does not cause sneezes...thanks rabbit! stay was awesome. zoe is super hospitable, apartment is great, clean towels, comfy clean bed, fun to hang with zoe what an awesome introduction to san francisco. zoe went out of her way to make sure i had a good time and an enjoyable stay. i am now living permanently in san francisco and now have a bunch of new friends thanks to zoe.  i couldn\\'t have asked for a better airbnb host. oh - and the house itself is gorgeous. zoe has great taste and has furnished the house beautifully. it is also in the heart of the mission, surrounded by great cafes, bars, restaurants, bi-rite and dolores park. \\r\\np.s. don\\'t forget to ask zoe about the lama. from beginning to end, top marks :) zoe was amazingly prompt with her replies and very accommodating. her flat is wonderful and beautifully decorated, not to mention in a fantastic location. the room is very clean and comfortable, with a great drafting table (bonus!). perfect for me, since i like to stand while working.\\r\\n\\r\\nzoe is a magnificent host. she\\'s great fun, sociable, welcoming, caring, and very attentive. she\\'s got lots of colourful stories also.\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks for the fun chats, and of course hosting me!what a lovely flat! zoe is super nice and fun and makes you feel at home. she has plenty of great recommandations to give. she was very welcoming and cooked amazing scrambled eggs and bacon on my first day! what a treat! \\r\\nthe mission is the best area to stay in sf, so many good bars, restaurants and great shops and the vibe is just really cool. the street where zoe\\'s flat is located is really nice and quiet. \\r\\na great experience, would love to go back. this was the best airbnb place i\\'ve stayed in so far! really nice flat, perfect location, and zoe was a super friendly and welcoming host.a nice apartment in an even more interesting neighborhood.\\r\\nthe mission district has a lot to offer with its many different cafès and restaurants.\\r\\nzoe was very kind and helpful, although i was not often present because i mainly came for business to san francisco.\\r\\na good experience!it\\'s hard to review zoe\\'s beautiful apartment on practicalities alone, as the experience of staying with her is something altogether special. from the moment i arrived it felt like a home and over the course of living there for a month, i felt enormously connected to the house, the location and the company of zoe and her amazing cat rabbit. we were both literally in tears when we said goodbye...\\r\\n\\r\\nzoe is an extraordinary host and an incredible woman. she goes to great lengths to make sure you feel comfortable and supported in whatever you need to make your experience enjoyable. she provides great conversation and company when you need it and then leaves you to your own devices. it’s impossible to not feel entirely intoxicated by her affirming attitude and approach to life. i don’t think i will ever forget the experience of living with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe apartment itself has an excellent kitchen and laundry with everything you might need and beautiful areas to eat and relax. the dinning area is especially good for breakfast as is the back deck for an afternoon spritzer! it\\'s located in a safe and convenient area of the mission with easy access to the 16th bart. plenty of places to eat in surrounding valencia/mission streets and a short walk to the bi-rite for amazing produce and treats. for the exercise friendly or simply to picnic, dolores park is a few minutes walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nit really doesn’t get much better than this!zoé\\'s place is the perfect place to stay in sf. really cosy and confortable. you feel good there. it\\'s really well-decorated and the kitchen is perfect (all the stuff you could need, only really good food : organic food etc.). the area is the best for me in sf, next to valencia street and dolores park and close to the main transportation (bart). the street is really cute and the neighborhood really pleasant. \\r\\nit was a great experience here, i definitly recommande it ! thanks zoé for everything (and rabbit the cat is so cute) zoe picked every piece in this beautiful home with great taste. though just one block away from mission street, san carlos street is quiet, so this apartment really is a sunny oasis - all the good restaurants are within walking distance. (though the roomy kitchen has all the supplies one could wish for, so cooking is also an option).\\r\\nzoe is very welcoming and will give you every tip you need! \\r\\nit was an awesome stay with zoe! the house is on a very convenient location, easy to access to a lot of great restaurants and stores. i really enjoyed it. zoe is such a great host!i stayed with zoe three times. my plan is to go back! \\r\\ni have been to many places, but still in my ranking: \\r\\nzoe is the most amazing host,\\r\\nher apartment in mission is the best place to stay in sf, \\r\\nand rabbit is the best cat ever! \\r\\ni definitely recommend it! \\r\\n\\r\\nyou should also know that: photos on the website reflect perfectly how zoe’s place looks like. it is a beautiful place, very relaxed, and clean. the mission district is in my view is the most interesting part of the city. if you want to feel real atmosphere of san francisco, you should choose zoe’s place. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nzoe was quick to respond, easy and flexible to coordinate with for check in, and a warm and welcoming host. a real \\' the shift off my back \\' human being, and someone i hope to stay with again and keep in touch with. had a friend like her when i lived in sf, it\\'s likely i\\'d still reside there!zoe is the ultimate host, she makes you feel home in a second and is very friendly. her place is just like her: naturally sophisticated and full of positive energy. zoe did an incredible job decorating the apartment, everything is like on the pictures and described, even better actually. the house is one of the most beautiful in the street. no need to say communication and organization went very smoothly, everything was easy and perfect. staying with zoe will definitely make your trip special, plus the listing is in the best part of the mission, i highly recommend it!!!
